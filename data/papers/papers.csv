34376515,Efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) is recommended for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), if general lifestyle and dietary advice fails. However, although the impact of a low FODMAP diet on individual IBS symptoms has been examined in some randomised controlled trials (RCTs), there has been no recent systematic assessment, and individual trials have studied numerous alternative or control interventions, meaning the best comparator is unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis addressing these uncertainties.
DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through to 2 April 2021 to identify RCTs of a low FODMAP diet in IBS. Efficacy was judged using dichotomous assessment of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs, and interventions ranked according to their P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs (944 patients). Based on failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms, a low FODMAP diet ranked first vs habitual diet (RR of symptoms not improving=0.67; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91, P-score=0.99), and was superior to all other interventions. Low FODMAP diet ranked first for abdominal pain severity, abdominal bloating or distension severity and bowel habit, although for the latter it was not superior to any other intervention. A low FODMAP diet was superior to British Dietetic Association (BDA)/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) dietary advice for abdominal bloating or distension (RR=0.72; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94). BDA/NICE dietary advice was not superior to any other intervention in any analysis.
CONCLUSION: In a network analysis, low FODMAP diet ranked first for all endpoints studied. However, most trials were based in secondary or tertiary care and did not study effects of FODMAP reintroduction and personalisation on symptoms.",Black CJ; Staudacher HM; Ford AC,2022,Gut,71,6,1117-1126,10.1136/gutjnl-2021-325214,"Black, C.

32702295,Global prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome according to Rome III or IV criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional bowel disorders, but community prevalence appears to vary widely between different countries. This variation might be due to the fact that previous cross-sectional surveys have neither applied uniform diagnostic criteria nor used identical methodology, rather than being due to true global variability. We aimed to determine the global prevalence of IBS.
METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from all population-based studies using relatively uniform methodology and using only the most recent iterations of the Rome criteria (Rome III and IV). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Classic (from Jan 1, 2006, to April 30, 2020) to identify cross-sectional surveys reporting the prevalence of IBS in adults (≥90% of participants aged ≥18 years) according to the Rome III or Rome IV criteria. We also hand-searched a selection of conference proceedings for relevant abstracts published between 2006 and 2019. We extracted prevalence data for all studies, according to the criteria used to define the presence of IBS. We did a meta-analysis to estimate pooled prevalence rates, according to study location and certain other characteristics (eg, sex and IBS subtype).
FINDINGS: We identified 4143 citations, of which 184 studies appeared relevant. 57 of these studies were eligible, and represented 92 separate adult populations, comprising 423 362 participants. The pooled prevalence of IBS in 53 studies that used the Rome III criteria, from 38 countries and comprising 395 385 participants, was 9·2% (95% CI 7·6-10·8; I2=99·7%). By contrast, pooled IBS prevalence among six studies that used the Rome IV criteria, from 34 countries and comprising 82 476 individuals, was 3·8% (95% CI 3·1-4·5; I2=96·6%). IBS with mixed bowel habit (IBS-M) was the most common subtype with the Rome III criteria, reported by 33·8% (95% CI 27·8-40·0; I2=98·1%) of people fulfilling criteria for IBS (ie, 3·7% [2·6-4·9] of all included participants had IBS-M), but IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) was the most common subtype with the Rome IV criteria (reported by 31·5% [95% CI 23·2-40·5; I2=98·1% 61·6%] of people with IBS, corresponding to 1·4% [0·9-1·9] of all included participants having IBS-D). The prevalence of IBS was higher in women than in men (12·0% [95% CI 9·3-15·0] vs 8·6% [6·3-11·2]; odds ratio 1·46 [95% CI 1·33-1·59]). Prevalence varied substantially between individual countries, and this variability persisted even when the same diagnostic criteria were applied and identical methodology was used in studies.
INTERPRETATION: Even when uniform symptom-based criteria are applied, based on identical methodology, to define the presence of IBS, prevalence varies substantially between countries. Prevalence was substantially lower with the Rome IV criteria, suggesting that these more restrictive criteria might be less suitable than Rome III for population-based epidemiological surveys.

36157114,"Gut microbiota, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.","The gut microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tracts of humans, living in symbiosis with the host. Dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance between the beneficial and opportunistic gut microbiota, is associated with several gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represented by ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and colorectal cancer (CRC). Dysbiosis can disrupt the mucosal barrier, resulting in perpetuation of inflammation and carcinogenesis. The increase in some specific groups of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), has been associated with chronic tissue inflammation and the release of pro-inflammatory and carcinogenic mediators, increasing the chance of developing CRC, following the inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence in IBD patients. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to analyze the correlation between changes in the gut microbiota and the development and maintenance of IBD, CRC, and IBD-associated CRC. Patients with IBD and CRC have shown reduced bacterial diversity and abundance compared to healthy individuals, with enrichment of Firmicute sand Bacteroidetes. Specific bacteria are also associated with the onset and progression of CRC, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, and ETBF. Future research can evaluate the advantages of modulating the gut microbiota as preventive measures in CRC high-risk patients, directly affecting the prognosis of the disease and the quality of life of patients.",Quaglio AEV; Grillo TG; De Oliveira ECS; Di Stasi LC; Sassaki LY,2022,World journal of gastroenterology,28,30,4053-4060,10.3748/wjg.v28.i30.4053,"Quaglio, A.

37541528,Efficacy of Probiotics in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some probiotics may be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but differences in species and strains used, as well as endpoints reported, have hampered attempts to make specific recommendations as to which should be preferred. We updated our previous meta-analysis examining this issue.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (up to March 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with IBS, comparing probiotics with placebo were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk of global symptoms, abdominal pain, or abdominal bloating or distension persisting after therapy, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference with a 95% CI. Adverse events data were also pooled.
RESULTS: We identified 82 eligible trials, containing 10,332 patients. Only 24 RCTs were at low risk of bias across all domains. For global symptoms, there was moderate certainty in the evidence for a benefit of Escherichia strains, low certainty for Lactobacillus strains and Lactobacillus plantarum 299V, and very low certainty for combination probiotics, LacClean Gold S, Duolac 7s, and Bacillus strains. For abdominal pain, there was low certainty in the evidence for a benefit of Saccharomyces cerevisae I-3856 and Bifidobacterium strains, and very low certainty for combination probiotics, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, and Bacillus strains. For abdominal bloating or distension there was very low certainty in the evidence for a benefit of combination probiotics and Bacillus strains. The relative risk of experiencing any adverse event, in 55 trials, including more than 7000 patients, was not significantly higher with probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Some combinations of probiotics or strains may be beneficial in IBS. However, certainty in the evidence for efficacy by GRADE criteria was low to very low across almost all of our analyses.",Goodoory VC; Khasawneh M; Black CJ; Quigley EMM; Moayyedi P; Ford AC,2023,Gastroenterology,165,5,1206-1218,10.1053/j.gastro.2023.07.018,"Goodoory, V.

35433498,Efficacy of Probiotics for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal condition. Studies regarding the treatment of IBS with probiotics have not yielded consistent results, and the best probiotics has not yet been confirmed. Therefore, we performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the relative rank order of different probiotics for IBS.
METHOD: We searched for RCTs on the efficacy of probiotics for IBS until August 25, 2021. The primary outcome was the symptom relief rate, as well as global symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, and straining scores. The NMA was conducted using Stata 15.0. We also used meta-regression to explore whether the treatment length and dose influenced the efficacy.
RESULTS: Forty-three RCTs, with 5,531 IBS patients, were included in this analysis. Firstly, we compared the efficacy of different probiotic species. B.coagulans exhibited the highest probability to be the optimal probiotic specie in improving IBS symptom relief rate, as well as global symptom, abdominal pain, bloating, and straining scores. In regard to the secondary outcomes, L.plantarum ranked first in ameliorating the QOL of IBS patients, but without any significant differences compared with other probiotic species in standardized mean differences (SMD) estimates. Moreover, patients received L.acidophilus had lowest incidence of adverse events. The meta-regression revealed that no significant differences were found between participants using different doses of probiotics in all outcomes, while the treatment length, as a confounder, can significantly influence the efficacy of probiotics in ameliorating abdominal pain (Coef = -2.30; p = 0.035) and straining (Coef = -3.15; p = 0.020) in IBS patients. Thus, we performed the subgroup analysis on treatment length subsequently in these two outcomes, which showed that efficacy of B.coagulans using 8 weeks ranked first both in improving the abdominal pain and straining scores. Additionally, B. coagulans still had significant efficacy compared to different types of probiotic combinations in present study.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this NMA suggested that B.coagulans had prominent efficacy in treating IBS patients, and incorporating B.coagulans into a probiotic combination, or genetically engineering it to amplify its biological function may be a future research target to treat IBS patients. With few direct comparisons available between individual therapies today, this NMA may have utility in forming treatment guideline for IBS with probiotics.",Zhang T; Zhang C; Zhang J; Sun F; Duan L,2022,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,12,,859967,10.3389/fcimb.2022.859967,"Zhang, T., Zhang, C., Zhang, J., Sun, F., & Duan, L.

37513532,High-Fiber Diet and Crohn's Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CD is a health problem in Western countries such as the US and European nations and is an idiopathic disease; however, certain cases of CD have been associated with intestinal dysbiosis. A systematic review with a meta-analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of a diet rich in fiber with or without cointervention to improve remission rates for CD. The literature in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases was reviewed. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Johanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. This review was conducted in accordance with the structure outlined in the PRISMA statement. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a random effects model. Eleven studies were included, totaling 2389 patients with CD. Applying a diet rich in fiber with or without the administration of routine therapies improved CD remission rates. Data regarding CD activity, remission time, and adverse effects derived from fiber consumption were analyzed. Consumption of fiber in the diet could improve remission rates for CD patients who receive or do not receive other treatment to maintain remission.",Serrano Fernandez V; Seldas Palomino M; Laredo-Aguilera JA; Pozuelo-Carrascosa DP; Carmona-Torres JM,2023,Nutrients,15,14,,10.3390/nu15143114,"Serrano Fernandez, V., Seldas Palomino, M., Laredo-Aguilera, J.

35942669,Systematic review and meta-analysis: efficacy of peppermint oil in irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, with a complex pathophysiology. Antispasmodics are prescribed as first-line therapy because of their action on gut dysmotility. In this regard, peppermint oil also has antispasmodic properties.
AIM: To update our previous meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of peppermint oil, particularly as recent studies have cast doubt on its role in the treatment of IBS METHODS: We searched the medical literature up to 2nd April 2022 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of peppermint oil in IBS. Efficacy and safety were judged using dichotomous assessments of effect on global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain, and occurrence of any adverse event or of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We identified 10 eligible RCTs (1030 patients). Peppermint oil was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptoms (RR of not improving = 0.65; 95% CI 0.43-0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4; 95% CI 2.5-71), and abdominal pain (RR of abdominal pain not improving = 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.93, NNT = 7; 95% CI 4-24). Adverse event rates were significantly higher with peppermint oil (RR of any adverse event = 1.57; 95% CI 1.04-2.37).
CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint oil was superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS, but adverse events were more frequent, and quality of evidence was very low. Adequately powered RCTs of peppermint oil as first-line treatment for IBS are needed.",Ingrosso MR; Ianiro G; Nee J; Lembo AJ; Moayyedi P; Black CJ; Ford AC,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,56,6,932-941,10.1111/apt.17179,"Ingrosso, M.

33585949,Efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet in adult irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: This review provides an updated overview of observational and intervention studies investigating the effect of a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols) diet (LFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, quality of life (QoL), nutritional adequacy, and gut microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.
METHODS: We systematically searched available literature until October 2020 for studies that investigated the effect of LFDs on GI symptoms, QoL, nutritional adequacy, and the gut microbiome in IBS patients. The data were represented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for IBS severity, and as mean differences (MD) for IBS-QoL. Meta-analyses were performed for the quantitative analyses using random effects models with inverse variance weighing.
RESULTS: Twelve papers (nine parallel trials, three crossover studies) were included for the meta-analysis. The LFD reduced IBS severity by a moderate-to-large extent as compared to a control diet (SMD - 0.66, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.44, I2 = 54%). When analyzing only studies that used the validated IBS-SSS questionnaire, a mean reduction of 45 points (95% CI - 77, - 14; I2 = 89%) was observed. Subgroup analyses on adherence, age, intervention duration, IBS subtype, outcome measure, and risk of bias revealed no significantly different results. The LFD also increased IBS-QoL scores, when compared with a control diet (MD 4.93; 95% CI 1.77, 8.08; I2 = 42%).
CONCLUSIONS: The low-FODMAP diet reduces GI symptoms and improves quality of life in IBS subjects as compared to control diets. Future work is required to obtain definitive answers regarding potential long-term effects of such diets on nutritional adequacy and the gut microbiome.

32276950,Efficacy of psychological therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: National guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) recommend that psychological therapies should be considered, but their relative efficacy is unknown, because there have been few head-to-head trials. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to try to resolve this uncertainty.
DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through January 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of psychological therapies for adults with IBS, compared with each other, or a control intervention. Trials reported a dichotomous assessment of symptom status after completion of therapy. We pooled data using a random effects model. Efficacy was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic, with a 95% CI to summarise efficacy of each comparison tested, and ranked by therapy according to P score.
RESULTS: We identified 41 eligible RCTs, containing 4072 participants. After completion of therapy, the psychological interventions with the largest numbers of trials, and patients recruited, demonstrating efficacy included self-administered or minimal contact cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83, P score 0.66), face-to-face CBT (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80, P score 0.65) and gut-directed hypnotherapy (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91, P score 0.57). After completion of therapy, among trials recruiting only patients with refractory symptoms, group CBT and gut-directed hypnotherapy were more efficacious than either education and/or support or routine care, and CBT via the telephone, contingency management, CBT via the internet and dynamic psychotherapy were all superior to routine care. Risk of bias of trials was high, with evidence of funnel plot asymmetry; the efficacy of psychological therapies is therefore likely to have been overestimated.
CONCLUSIONS: Several psychological therapies are efficacious for IBS, although none were superior to another. CBT-based interventions and gut-directed hypnotherapy had the largest evidence base and were the most efficacious long term.

33385426,Prognostic Factors for Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify all prognostic factors for advanced colorectal neoplasia (aCRN, high-grade dysplasia, or CRC) in patients with IBD.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted according to the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Random-effects models were created separately for odds and hazard ratios, different study designs, and univariable or multivariable data. The evidence for all prognostic factors was categorized as ""weak"", ""moderate"", or ""strong"", based on estimate of effect sizes, heterogeneity, and risk of bias.
RESULTS: A total of 164 studies were included, allowing pooled analysis of 31 potential prognostic factors. In the univariable analysis, the evidence for extensive disease was classified as strong while evidence for low-grade dysplasia, strictures, primary sclerosing cholangitis, post-inflammatory polyps, family history of CRC, and ulcerative colitis versus Crohn's disease was considered moderate. Evidence for any dysplasia, colon segment resection, aneuploidy, male sex, and age was classified as weak. In addition, histologic inflammation was identified as a risk factor in multivariable analysis (weak evidence). The evidence for the protective factors colonoscopic surveillance, 5-Aminosalicylic Acid, thiopurines, and smoking was moderate in univariable analysis. Multivariable analysis provided weak evidence for statin use.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified 13 risk factors and 5 protective factors for aCRN in IBD patients, based on univariable and/or multivariable pooled analyses.

33555375,"Clinical effects and gut microbiota changes of using probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","PURPOSE: Probiotics have been reported to be beneficial for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the types, number of strains, dosage, and intervention time of probiotics used remain controversial. Furthermore, the changes of gut microbiota in IBD's patients are also intriguing. Thus, this meta-analysis was to explore the clinical effects and gut microbiota changes of using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.
METHODS: The search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane library from inception to April 2020. Qualified randomized controlled trials were included. IBD's remission rate, disease activity index and recurrence rate were extracted and analyzed. Changes in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD are comprehensively described.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles were included. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can induce/maintain IBD's remission and reduce ulcerative colitis (UC) disease activity index (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02, 1.26, P < 0.05; SMD = 1.00, 95% CI 0.27, 1.73, P < 0.05). In subgroup analyses of IBD remission rate and UC disease activity index, we obtained some statistically significant results in some subgroup (P < 0.05). To some extent, probiotic supplements can increase the number of beneficial bacteria (especially Bifidobacteria) in the intestinal tract of patients with IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the treatment of IBD (especially UC) with pro/pre/synbiotics, and synbiotics are more effective. Probiotic supplements that are based on Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium or more than one strain are more likely to be beneficial for IBD remission. The dose of 1010-1012 CFU/day may be a reference range for using probiotics to relieve IBD.",Zhang XF; Guan XX; Tang YJ; Sun JF; Wang XK; Wang WD; Fan JM,2021,European journal of nutrition,60,5,2855-2875,10.1007/s00394-021-02503-5,"Zhang, X.

32949284,Endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Irritable bowel disease and endometriosis are two common diseases characterized by chronic inflammation state and recurrent abdominal pain. As a consequence of sharing of symptoms and chronic inflammation, endometriosis and IBS may coexist and be misdiagnosed and this leads to delays in diagnosis, mismanagement, and unnecessary testing. In recent years, some studies have found higher risk of IBS in women with endometriosis, compared to women without endometriosis. To provide a general overview, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis on published data on this issue.
METHODS: By a systematic literature search selection process, 11 studies were identified for the current study: 2 prospective and 2 retrospective cohort studies, 4 case-control studies, 1 cross-sectional study and 2 clinical series.
RESULTS: When we meta-analysed data about the prevalence of IBS in women with endometriosis, the overall OR (95%CI), compared to women without endometriosis was 3.26 (1.97-5.39) with no statistically significant heterogeneity. All three studies considering the incidence of IBS in women with a previous diagnosis of endometriosis showed about twofold greater risk among women with endometriosis than women without. Likewise, in the random effects model of the meta-analysis, the overall OR of history of IBS in women with endometriosis was 3.10 (95% CI 2.06-4.67), with no heterogeneity between three studies considered.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a link between endometriosis and IBS, highlighting two or more times higher risk of IBS in women with endometriosis compared to women without the condition.",Chiaffarino F; Cipriani S; Ricci E; Mauri PA; Esposito G; Barretta M; Vercellini P; Parazzini F,2021,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,303,1,17-25,10.1007/s00404-020-05797-8,"Chiaffarino, F., Cipriani, S., Ricci, E., Mauri, P.

33170492,Rosacea and the Microbiome: A Systematic Review.,"Rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent episodes of facial flushing, erythema, pustules, and telangiectasia, largely affects fair-skinned women over 30 years of age. Although a long-recognized entity, the exact pathophysiology of this disease is still debated. Current theories highlight the role of the cutaneous microbiome and its associated inflammatory effects in rosacea's pathogenesis. However, microbiological reverberations are not limited to the skin, as recent studies have described the potential cutaneous effects of alterations in the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome. Associations with additional GI pathologies, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have been investigated, as well as Helicobacter pylori infection. In an attempt to better understand and characterize these relationships, as well as current treatment options, we conducted a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase from their inception to August 6, 2020. We have synthesized the literature findings within three sections of this manuscript: the cutaneous microbiome, the gut microbiome, and therapeutic strategies. Future studies should focus on specific mechanisms linking GI pathology with rosacea manifestations and the role of enteral drugs in mitigating cutaneous symptoms.",Daou H; Paradiso M; Hennessy K; Seminario-Vidal L,2021,Dermatology and therapy,11,1,1-12,10.1007/s13555-020-00460-1,"Daou, H., Paradiso, M., Hennessy, K., & Seminario-Vidal, L.

The efficacy of different probiotics in treating IBS remains controversial. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare and rank the outcome-specific efficacy of different probiotic strains or combinations in adults with IBS. We searched the literature up to June 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in IBS were included. A frequentist framework was used to perform this study. In total, 9253 participants from 81 RCTs were included in the study. Four probiotic strains and five mixtures were significantly superior to placebo in improving IBS Symptom Severity Scale, among which Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 ranked first (surface under the cumulative ranking, SUCRA, 92.9%). A mixture containing five probiotics (SUCRA, 100%) ranked first in improving the IBS-Quality of life. Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 (SUCRA, 96.9%) and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 (SUCRA, 92.6%) were among the most effective probiotics for improving abdominal pain. Three probiotic strains and two mixtures were effective in alleviating abdominal bloating. Four probiotic strains and a mixture were significantly superior to placebo in reducing the bowel movement frequency in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 (SUCRA, 99.6%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 (SUCRA, 89.7%) were among the most effective probiotics for improving the Bristol stool form scale of IBS-D.

33811041,Long-term dietary patterns are associated with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory features of the gut microbiome.,"OBJECTIVE: The microbiome directly affects the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the gut. As microbes thrive on dietary substrates, the question arises whether we can nourish an anti-inflammatory gut ecosystem. We aim to unravel interactions between diet, gut microbiota and their functional ability to induce intestinal inflammation.
DESIGN: We investigated the relation between 173 dietary factors and the microbiome of 1425 individuals spanning four cohorts: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and the general population. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to profile gut microbial composition and function. Dietary intake was assessed through food frequency questionnaires. We performed unsupervised clustering to identify dietary patterns and microbial clusters. Associations between diet and microbial features were explored per cohort, followed by a meta-analysis and heterogeneity estimation.
RESULTS: We identified 38 associations between dietary patterns and microbial clusters. Moreover, 61 individual foods and nutrients were associated with 61 species and 249 metabolic pathways in the meta-analysis across healthy individuals and patients with IBS, Crohn's disease and UC (false discovery rate<0.05). Processed foods and animal-derived foods were consistently associated with higher abundances of Firmicutes, Ruminococcus species of the Blautia genus and endotoxin synthesis pathways. The opposite was found for plant foods and fish, which were positively associated with short-chain fatty acid-producing commensals and pathways of nutrient metabolism.
CONCLUSION: We identified dietary patterns that consistently correlate with groups of bacteria with shared functional roles in both, health and disease. Moreover, specific foods and nutrients were associated with species known to infer mucosal protection and anti-inflammatory effects. We propose microbial mechanisms through which the diet affects inflammatory responses in the gut as a rationale for future intervention studies.",Bolte LA; Vich Vila A; Imhann F; Collij V; Gacesa R; Peters V; Wijmenga C; Kurilshikov A; Campmans-Kuijpers MJE; Fu J; Dijkstra G; Zhernakova A; Weersma RK,2021,Gut,70,7,1287-1298,10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322670,"Bolte, L.

METHODS: This was a systematic review and individual-patient data meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of biologics approved for IBD at study inception (October 2015), using Vivli data-sharing platform. The primary outcome was the proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission in patients with short-duration (≤18 months) vs long-duration disease (>18 months) analyzed separately for CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). We used meta-regression to examine the impact of patients' characteristics on the primary outcome.
RESULTS: We included 25 trials, testing infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab (6168 patients with CD and 3227 patients with UC). In CD, remission induction rates were higher in pooled placebo and patients in active arms with short-duration disease of ≤18 months (41.4% [244 of 589]) compared with disease duration of >18 months (29.8% [852 of 2857], meta-analytically estimated odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.64). The primary outcome, proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission, was not different in short-duration disease of ≤18 months (n = 589, odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.15) compared with longer disease duration (n = 2857, odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.72). In UC trials, both the proportional biologic/placebo remission-induction effect and the pooled biologic-placebo effect were stable, regardless of disease duration. Primary outcome results remained unchanged when tested using alternative temporal cutoffs and when modeled for individual patient's covariates, including prior anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: There are higher rates of induction of remission with biologics and with placebo in early CD, resulting in a treatment to placebo effect ratio that is similar across disease durations. No such relationships between disease duration and outcomes was found in UC.

There are increasing numbers of research studies exploring treatment options involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), but it is still uncertain which treatment option is superior. The research was conducted on various databases and unpublished trial data (up to February 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for adult patients with IBS comparing interventions with placebo. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and FMT were assessed for their impact using mean difference and Bayesian network meta-analysis. Out of 6528 articles, 54 were included for probiotics, 7 for prebiotics/synbiotics, and 6 for FMT. Probiotics showed improvement in IBS symptoms, particularly with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. Prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement. Network meta-analysis indicated the favorable effects of probiotics (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.59) and FMT (OR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64) on IBS, with no serious adverse events reported. In short, probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains.

37977068,Effectiveness and safety of upadacitinib for inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT and real-world observational studies.,"BACKGROUND: Upadacitinib, a novel and selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1, has demonstrated promising efficacy in managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, our primary aim was to comprehensively assess the therapeutic effectiveness and safety profile of upadacitinib in the treatment of patients with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature search across prominent databases, including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, to identify pertinent studies providing insights into the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in IBD. The primary endpoint was the achievement of clinical remission, while secondary endpoints encompassed clinical response, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and the evaluation of adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: In this meta-analysis of nine studies, we categorized results by study type. Clinical remission rates were: RCTs 36 % (95 % CI = 30-42 %), real-world studies 25 % (95 % CI = 1-49 %), retrospective studies 40 % (95 % CI = 24-56 %), cohort studies 55 % (95 % CI = 25-85 %). Clinical response rates were: RCTs 61 % (95 % CI = 55-67 %), real-world studies 42 % (95 % CI = 14-70 %), cohort studies 65 % (95 % CI = 57-73 %). Endoscopic remission rates were: RCTs 19 % (95 % CI = 15-24 %), cohort studies 29 % (95 % CI = 5-52 %). Endoscopic response rates were: RCTs 41 % (95 % CI = 36-47 %), cohort studies 57 % (95 % CI = 31-83 %). Incidence rate for any AEs: IBD 69 % (95 % CI = 63-76 %), UC 65 % (95 % CI = 57-74 %), CD 75 % (95 % CI = 67-82 %).

39013599,Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia after acute gastroenteritis: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Disorders of gut-brain interaction may arise after acute gastroenteritis. Data on the influence of pathogen type on the risk of postinfection IBS (PI-IBS), as on postinfection functional dyspepsia (PI-FD), are limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine prevalence of PI-IBS or PI-FD after acute gastroenteritis.
DESIGN: We included observational studies recruiting ≥50 adults and reporting prevalence of IBS or FD after acute gastroenteritis with ≥3-month follow-up. A random effects model was used to estimate prevalence and ORs with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: In total, 47 studies (28 170 subjects) were eligible. Overall prevalence of PI-IBS and PI-FD were 14.5% and 12.7%, respectively. IBS persisted in 39.8% of subjects in the long-term (>5 years follow-up) after diagnosis. Individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis had a significantly higher odds of IBS (OR 4.3) and FD (OR 3.0) than non-exposed controls. PI-IBS was most associated with parasites (prevalence 30.1%), but in only two studies, followed by bacteria (18.3%) and viruses (10.7%). In available studies, Campylobacter was associated with the highest PI-IBS prevalence (20.7%) whereas Proteobacteria and SARS-CoV-2 yielded the highest odds for PI-IBS (both OR 5.4). Prevalence of PI-FD was 10.0% for SARS-CoV-2 and 13.6% for bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae 19.4%).
CONCLUSION: In a large systematic review and meta-analysis, 14.5% of individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis developed PI-IBS and 12.7% PI-FD, with greater than fourfold increased odds for IBS and threefold for FD.

34589512,Inflammatory and Microbiota-Related Regulation of the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier.,"The intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) is one of the largest interfaces between the environment and the internal milieu of the body. It is essential to limit the passage of harmful antigens and microorganisms and, on the other side, to assure the absorption of nutrients and water. The maintenance of this delicate equilibrium is tightly regulated as it is essential for human homeostasis. Luminal solutes and ions can pass across the IEB via two main routes: the transcellular pathway or the paracellular pathway. Tight junctions (TJs) are a multi-protein complex responsible for the regulation of paracellular permeability. TJs control the passage of antigens through the IEB and have a key role in maintaining barrier integrity. Several factors, including cytokines, gut microbiota, and dietary components are known to regulate intestinal TJs. Gut microbiota participates in several human functions including the modulation of epithelial cells and immune system through the release of several metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Mediators released by immune cells can induce epithelial cell damage and TJs dysfunction. The subsequent disruption of the IEB allows the passage of antigens into the mucosa leading to further inflammation. Growing evidence indicates that dysbiosis, immune activation, and IEB dysfunction have a role in several diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and gluten-related conditions. Here we summarize the interplay between the IEB and gut microbiota and mucosal immune system and their involvement in IBS, IBD, and gluten-related disorders.",Barbara G; Barbaro MR; Fuschi D; Palombo M; Falangone F; Cremon C; Marasco G; Stanghellini V,2021,Frontiers in nutrition,8,,718356,10.3389/fnut.2021.718356,"Barbara, G., Barbaro, M.

37678185,Intestinal proteases.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Proteases constitute a group of enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds. Intestinal proteases are an integral part of gut homeostasis and digestion. This review discusses the broader classification of proteases, regulation of proteolytic activity (PA) in the intestinal tract, and how dysregulation of intestinal proteases contributes to the pathophysiology of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease. We also discuss recent advancements in therapeutic modulation that directly or indirectly target intestinal proteases and can be utilized to treat these illnesses.
RECENT FINDINGS: Host and microbiota derived proteases have been associated with symptoms in subsets of patients with IBS, IBD and celiac disease. Elevated PA mediates barrier dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity as well as immune activation and inflammation. Recent mechanistic studies have revealed the nature of disease-associated proteases and mechanisms regulating their activity, particularly those driven by the microbiota. Advancements in activity-based probes have allowed novel ways of in vivo imaging of PA. Newer strategies targeting proteases include monoclonal antibodies, engineered microbiota as well as specific protease inhibitors.
SUMMARY: Significant progresses made in the detection as well as regulation of PA is likely to provide therapeutic advancements for gastrointestinal diseases.",Rao S; Grover M,2023,Current opinion in gastroenterology,39,6,472-478,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000972,"Rao, S., & Grover, M.

37202602,Nightshade Vegetables: A Dietary Trigger for Worsening Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome?,"The Solanaceae family of plants, commonly known as Nightshade vegetables or Nightshades, contains a diverse range of crops of over 2000 members with significant culinary, economic, and cultural importance. Familiar edible Nightshades include tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and white potatoes. Many pharmacologically active compounds used in traditional medicine, including atropine and hyoscyamine, are derived from Nightshades. In addition to these beneficial pharmacologic agents, Nightshade-derived glycoalkaloid compounds, a key defense mechanism against predation, have been shown to disrupt intestinal epithelium and to potentially activate mast cells in the gut mucosa, leading to adverse symptoms in humans. There is a new appreciation that mast cell activation is an allergic inflammatory mechanism contributing both to pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given their ubiquity in Western diets and their shared glycoalkaloid active compounds, edible Nightshades are attracting new interest as a potential trigger for worsening gut symptoms in functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders. Here, we review the limited existing literature on the adverse effects of Nightshade consumption, including the effects of Nightshade-derived glycoalkaloids on IBD gut inflammation, and the under-recognized contribution of Nightshades to food allergies and allergic cross-reactivity.

39064809,Correlation between Alzheimer's Disease and Gastrointestinal Tract Disorders.,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes deposition of amyloid-β in the central nervous system, presence of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and a decreased amount of synapses. It remains uncertain what causes the progression of the disease. Nowadays, it is suggested that the brain is connected to the gastrointestinal tract, especially the enteric nervous system and gut microbiome. Studies have found a positive association between AD and gastrointestinal diseases such as periodontitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease and microbiome disorders. H. pylori and its metabolites can enter the CNS via the oropharyngeal olfactory pathway and may predispose to the onset and progression of AD. Periodontitis may cause systemic inflammation of low severity with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide from oral bacteria accompanies beta-amyloid in plaques that form in the brain. Increased intestinal permeability in IBS leads to neuronal inflammation from transference. Chronic inflammation may lead to beta-amyloid plaque formation in the intestinal tract that spreads to the brain via the vagus nerve. The microbiome plays an important role in many bodily functions, such as nutrient absorption and vitamin production, but it is also an important factor in the development of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Both the quantity and diversity of the microbiome change significantly in patients with AD and even in people in the preclinical stage of the disease, when symptoms are not yet present. The microbiome influences the functioning of the central nervous system through, among other things, the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Given the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of AD, antibiotic therapy, probiotics and prebiotics, and faecal transplantation are being considered as possible therapeutic options.",Kuźniar J; Kozubek P; Czaja M; Leszek J,2024,Nutrients,16,14,,10.3390/nu16142366,"Kuźniar, J., Kozubek, P., Czaja, M., & Leszek, J.

Understanding and intervening in this axis opens a pathway for therapeutic advancements for neurological and gastrointestinal diseases where the GBA has been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology. In light of this, the current review assesses the effectiveness of neuromodulation techniques in treating neurological and gastrointestinal disorders by modulating the GBA, involving key elements such as gut microbiota, neurotrophic factors, and proinflammatory cytokines. Through a comprehensive literature review encompassing PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, this research highlights the role played by the GBA in neurological and gastrointestinal diseases, in addition to the impact of neuromodulation on the management of these conditions which include both gastrointestinal (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) and neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neuropsychiatric disorders). Despite existing challenges, the ability of neuromodulation to adjust disrupted neural pathways, alleviate pain, and mitigate inflammation is significant in improving the quality of life for patients, thereby offering exciting prospects for future advancements in patient care.",Aljeradat B; Kumar D; Abdulmuizz S; Kundu M; Almealawy YF; Batarseh DR; Atallah O; Ennabe M; Alsarafandi M; Alan A; Weinand M,2024,Pathophysiology : the official journal of the International Society for Pathophysiology,31,2,244-268,10.3390/pathophysiology31020019,"Aljeradat, B., Kumar, D., Abdulmuizz, S., Kundu, M., Almealawy, Y.

38173154,Symptomatic Response to Antibiotics in Patients With Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the symptomatic response rate to antibiotics in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Similarly, we performed a meta-analysis on the symptomatic response to antibiotics in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with and without SIBO.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to March 2021. Randomized controlled trials and prospective studies reporting dichotomous outcomes were included.
RESULTS: There were 6 studies included in the first meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of antibiotics to placebo or no antibiotic. This included 196 patients, of whom 101 received antibiotics and 95 received placebo or no antibiotics. Significantly more patients improved with antibiotics (relative risk [95% CI] = 2.46 [1.33-4.55], P = 0.004). There were 4 studies included in the analysis comparing symptomatic response rates in IBS patients with or without SIBO with 266 IBS patients, of whom 172 had SIBO and 94 did not. The pooled response rate for symptomatic response was 51.2% in the SIBO group vs 23.4% in the no SIBO group, respectively. Significantly more IBS patients with SIBO responded to antibiotics compared to those without SIBO (relative risk [95% CI] = 2.07 [1.40-3.08], P = 0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics appear to be efficacious in treating SIBO, although small sample sizes and poor data quality limit this interpretation. Symptomatic response rates also appear to be higher in IBS patients with SIBO. This may be the first example of precision medicine in IBS as opposed to our current empiric treatment approach. Large-multicenter studies are needed to verify the results.",Takakura W; Rezaie A; Chey WD; Wang J; Pimentel M,2024,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,30,1,7-16,10.5056/jnm22187,"Takakura, W., Rezaie, A., Chey, W.

35766861,Physical activity for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Current recommendations for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to partake in physical activity are based on low-level evidence, do not incorporate evidence from all available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and provide little information regarding potential adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of physical activity interventions in adults diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and to explore possible effect moderators including type, setting and nature of physical activity interventions.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 5 November 2021. We handsearched reference lists and sought unpublished studies through trial registries.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs involving adults (aged 18 years or older) diagnosed with IBS and conducted in any setting comparing a physical activity intervention with no intervention, usual care or wait-list control group or another physical activity intervention group and assessing a validated measure of symptoms, quality of life or bowel movement.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted study data, and performed risk of bias and GRADE assessments to assess the certainty of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and synthesised data from other studies narratively.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs with data for 622 participants. Most (10/11) were set in high- or middle- to high-income countries, with five involving supervised physical activity, three unsupervised activity and three a mix of supervised and unsupervised activity. No trial was at low risk of bias. Four trials specified a minimally important difference for at least one assessed outcome measure. Data for 10 trials were obtained from published journal articles, with data for one obtained from an unpublished Masters degree thesis. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms Six RCTs assessed the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention compared with usual care on global symptoms of IBS. Meta-analysis of five studies showed an observed improvement in reported symptoms following physical activity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.44 to -0.42; 185 participants). We rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as very low due to unclear and high risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision from sparse data. This means physical activity may improve IBS symptoms but the evidence is very uncertain. The results of the remaining study supported the meta-analysis but were at unclear risk of bias and sample size was small. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of a yoga intervention compared with a walking intervention on global IBS symptoms. Meta-analysis of these two studies found no conclusive evidence of an effect of yoga compared with walking on IBS symptoms (SMD -1.16, 95% CI -3.93 to 1.62; 124 participants). We rated the certainty of evidence as very low, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga interventions compared with walking interventions on IBS symptoms. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention (yoga) compared with medication. One reported no observed difference in global IBS symptoms, though CIs were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the observed estimates and risk of bias was high (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.65 to 0.25; 21 participants). We excluded IBS symptom data for the remaining study as it used a non-validated method. One study compared a yoga intervention with a dietary intervention and reported an observed improvement in symptoms with both interventions but neither intervention was superior to the other. Quality of life Five RCTs assessed the impact of physical activity on self-reported quality of life compared with usual care. Meta-analysis of data from four studies found no improvement in quality of life following a physical activity intervention (SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.30 to 2.64; 134 participants; very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision). We rated the certainty of evidence as very low, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity interventions on quality-of-life outcomes in people with IBS. One study assessed the impact on quality of life of a yoga intervention compared with walking and observed an improvement in the yoga group (MD 53.45, 95% CI 38.85 to 68.05; 97 participants ). One study reported no observed difference in quality of life between a yoga and a dietary intervention. Abdominal pain Two trials assessed the impact of physical activity compared with usual care on reported abdominal pain. Meta-analysis found no improvement in abdominal pain with physical activity compared with usual care (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.50; 64 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low due to risk of bias and imprecision, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity interventions on abdominal pain in people with IBS. One study assessing the impact of a yoga intervention compared with walking advice reported no observed differences between groups on abdominal pain. One study comparing a yoga intervention with a dietary intervention found neither intervention had a more beneficial impact than the other and both interventions did not conclusively reduce abdominal pain. There was insufficient evidence to adequately assess adverse effects associated with physical activity due to a lack of reporting in trials. One study reported a musculoskeletal injury in a yoga intervention group but this did not result in withdrawal from the study.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Findings from a small body of evidence suggest that physical activity comprising of yoga, treadmill exercise or support to increase physical activity may improve symptoms but not quality of life or abdominal pain in people diagnosed with IBS but we have little confidence in these conclusions due to the very low certainty of evidence. The numbers of reported adverse events were low and the certainty of these findings was very low for all comparisons, so no conclusions can be drawn. Discussions with patients considering physical activity as part of symptom management should address the uncertainty in the evidence to ensure fully informed decisions. If deemed sufficiently important to patients and healthcare providers, higher quality research is needed to enable more certain conclusions.",Nunan D; Cai T; Gardener AD; Ordóñez-Mena JM; Roberts NW; Thomas ET; Mahtani KR,2022,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,6,6,CD011497,10.1002/14651858.CD011497.pub2,"Nunan, D., Cai, T., Gardener, A.

35631213,A Low-FODMAP Diet Provides Benefits for Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms but Not for Improving Stool Consistency and Mucosal Inflammation in IBD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet (LFD) is claimed to improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms (FGSs). However, the role of LFD in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with FGSs remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the efficacy of LFD in IBD patients with FGSs.
METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception to 1 January 2022. Data were synthesized as the relative risk of symptoms improvement and normal stool consistency, mean difference of Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QoL), Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBi), Mayo score, and fecal calprotectin (FC). Risk of bias was assessed based on study types. A funnel plot and Egger's test were used to analyze publication bias.
RESULTS: This review screened and included nine eligible studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five before-after studies, involving a total of 446 participants (351 patients with LFD vs. 95 controls). LFD alleviated overall FGSs (RR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33-0.66, p = 0.0000) and obtained higher SIBDQ scores (MD = 11.24, 95% CI 6.61 to 15.87, p = 0.0000) and lower HBi score of Crohn's disease (MD = -1.09, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.42, p = 0.002). However, there were no statistically significant differences in normal stool consistency, BSFS, IBS-QoL, Mayo score of ulcerative colitis, and FC. No publication bias was found.
CONCLUSIONS: LFD provides a benefit in FGSs and QoL but not for improving stool consistency and mucosal inflammation in IBD patients. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to develop the optimal LFD strategy for IBD.",Peng Z; Yi J; Liu X,2022,Nutrients,14,10,,10.3390/nu14102072,"Peng, Z., Yi, J., & Liu, X. (2022).

31859183,"Efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, and gut-brain neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Although novel therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) continue to be developed, many doctors rely on more established, traditional therapies as first-line or second-line treatment options. These therapies include soluble fibre (eg, ispaghula husk), antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators (including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or α-2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands). However, the relative efficacy of traditional treatments in patients with IBS is unclear because there have been few head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to compare and rank the efficacy of traditional therapies in patients with IBS to help inform clinical decisions.
METHODS: For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to week 2 of August 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials or supplementary data published up to Aug 18, 2019; and gastroenterology conference proceedings for study abstracts published between 2001 and Aug 18, 2019. We included RCTs that compared any of these treatments with each other (head-to-head trials) or with placebo, in which the efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, or gut-brain neuromodulators was assessed in adults (aged at least 18 years) with IBS of any subtype after 4-12 weeks of treatment. Only RCTs reporting a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, in terms of either improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in abdominal pain, were included. The efficacy and safety of all treatments were reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and treatments were ranked according to their P-score.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 5863 references, of which 81 were screened for eligibility. 51 RCTs with data from 4644 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis, but only 13 of these trials were at low risk of bias. Based on an endpoint of failure to achieve improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, peppermint oil capsules were ranked first for efficacy (RR 0·63, 95% CI 0·48-0·83, P-score 0·84) and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked second (0·66, 0·53-0·83, P-score 0·77). For failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, there were no significant differences between active treatments after direct or indirect comparisons. For failure to achieve improvement in abdominal pain at 4-12 weeks, tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy (0·53, 0·34-0·83, P-score 0·87); however, this result was based on data from only four RCTs involving 92 patients. For failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal pain, none of the active treatments showed superior efficacy upon indirect comparison. Tricyclic antidepressants were more likely than placebo to lead to adverse events (1·59, 1·26-2·06, P-score 0·16).
INTERPRETATION: In this network meta-analysis of RCTs of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators for IBS, few of which were judged as being at a low risk of bias, peppermint oil was ranked first for efficacy when global symptoms were used as the outcome measure, and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy when abdominal pain was used as the outcome measure. However, because of the lack of methodological rigour of some RCTs analysed in our study, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty around these findings. In addition, because treatment duration in most included trials was 4-12 weeks, the long-term relative efficacy of these treatments is unknown.

38754307,"The efficacy and real-world effectiveness of a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD) has been shown to effectively reduce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Effects resulting from real-world studies may differ from those seen in efficacy studies because of the diversity of patients in real-world settings. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effect of the LFD on reducing IBS symptoms and improving the quality of life (QoL) in efficacy trials and real-world studies.
METHODS: Major databases, trial registries, dissertations, and journals were systematically searched for studies on the LFD in adults with IBS. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model with standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Outcomes of interest were all patient-reported: stool consistency, stool frequency, abdominal pain, overall symptoms, adequate symptom relief, IBS-specific QoL and adherence to the LFD.
RESULTS: Eleven efficacy and 19 real-world studies were reviewed. The meta-analysis results for abdominal pain (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.54) and QoL (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.50) showed the LFD was beneficial in efficacy studies with no statistically significant results for stool frequency (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.07). Real-world studies found improvements in abdominal pain and QoL. Due to heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was done for stool consistency and overall symptoms. In these outcomes, results were mostly supportive of the LFD, but they were not always statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest the LFD improves outcomes compared to a control diet (efficacy studies) or baseline data (real-world studies). Because of diverse study designs and heterogeneity of results, a clear superiority of the LFD over control diets could not be concluded. There are no indications of an efficacy-effectiveness gap for the LFD in adults with IBS.",Jent S; Bez NS; Haddad J; Catalano L; Egger KS; Raia M; Tedde GS; Rogler G,2024,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",43,6,1551-1562,10.1016/j.clnu.2024.05.014,"Jent, S., Bez, N.

38711328,Effects of a low FODMAP diet on the symptom management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic umbrella review with the meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"A low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a common restrictive diet to manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no consensus on the alleviating effects of this diet. Herein, a systematic umbrella review with meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of an LFD on IBS symptoms and its secondary outcomes in patients, which were not reported in previous meta-analyses. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to December 2023. The methodological quality of systematic reviews and their included trials was evaluated using AMSTAR 2 and the Cochrane risk of bias, respectively. The certainty of the evidence tool was evaluated using the GRADE approach. The data related to IBS symptoms, quality of life (QoL), microbiome diversity, and stool short-chain fatty acids were extracted. A random-effect (if RCTs ≥ 6) or fixed-effect model (if RCTs < 5) was used to recalculate effect sizes and 95% CIs and report them in both qualitative and quantitative terms (pooled risk ratio, Hedges' g, and weighted mean difference). A total of 658 articles were initially identified, with 11 meta-analyses and 24 RCTs reporting 28 outcomes with 1646 participants included. An LFD significantly affected the clinical improvement of total symptoms according to the IBS-SSS questionnaire (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.97; P = 0.04) in all the subtypes of IBS and also had favorable effects on stool consistency (WMD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.902, -0.07) and frequency (WMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.10) and some other GI symptoms in both less and more than 4 weeks of diet intervention except for stool consistency, which needed more than 4 weeks of LFD implementation. A significant QoL improvement was observed but not in the anxiety and depression state. Furthermore, some studies showed that an LFD may increase fecal pH and dysbiosis and reduce SCFA and the abundance of Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, an LFD can alleviate symptoms and QoL in IBS patients, although dysbiosis may occur. Considering the low certainty of evidence, strong RCTs with more appropriate designs are needed.",Khalighi Sikaroudi M; Soltani S; Ghoreishy SM; Ebrahimi Z; Shidfar F; Dehnad A,2024,Food & function,15,10,5195-5208,10.1039/d3fo03717g,"Khalighi Sikaroudi, M., Soltani, S., Ghoreishy, S.

37172544,The bidirectional risk of inflammatory bowel disease and anxiety or depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with anxiety and depression, but the magnitude and directionality of risk remains uncertain. This study quantifies the risk of anxiety or depression following a diagnosis of IBD, and the risk of IBD in individuals with anxiety or depression, using population representative data.
METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search using MEDLINE and Embase and included unselected cohort studies reporting risk of anxiety or depression in patients with IBD or risk of IBD in patients with anxiety or depression. We undertook Random Effect Model meta-analysis to calculate pooled Hazard Ratios (HR) for the risk of anxiety and depression in IBD and subgroup meta-analysis to calculate risk by IBD subtype and in pediatric-onset IBD.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included; seven of which examined incidence of anxiety or depression among a total of >150,000 IBD patients. Meta-analysis showed an increased risk of both anxiety (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.29-1.70) and depression (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.35-1.78) following IBD diagnosis. Two studies investigating >400,000 individuals with depression showed a 2-fold increased risk of IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: The bidirectional association between IBD and anxiety and depression is clinically relevant and could indicate shared or mutually dependent disease mechanisms.",Bisgaard TH; Allin KH; Elmahdi R; Jess T,2023,General hospital psychiatry,83,,109-116,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2023.05.002,"Bisgaard, T.

37375612,Efficacy of Different Dietary Patterns in the Treatment of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review of Intervention Studies.,"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children and adolescents. In recent years, interest in the role of diet in the treatment of FGIDs has increased. Currently, interest focuses on the low-FODMAP diet (LFD), the fructose- or lactose-restricted diet (FRD or LRD), the gluten-free diet (GFD), and the Mediterranean diet (MD). In this review, we focus on the role of these dietary patterns in the FGIDs most commonly diagnosed in clinical practice, namely irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal pain (FAP), functional dyspepsia (FD), and functional constipation (FC). Fifteen clinical trials were systematically reviewed (both RCTs and single-arm clinical trials). We demonstrated the lack of high-quality intervention trials. Based on current evidence, low-FODMAP diet, LRD, FRD, and GFD have no place in daily clinical practice for the management of children and adolescents with FGIDs. Nevertheless, some patients with IBS or RAP may experience some benefit from the use of a low-FODMAP diet or FRD/LRD. Limited data suggest that MD may be promising in the management of FGIDs, especially in IBS patients, but more data are required to investigate the mechanisms of its protective effects.",Katsagoni CN; Karagianni VM; Papadopoulou A,2023,Nutrients,15,12,,10.3390/nu15122708,"Katsagoni, C.

33917379,Gastroprotective Effects of Polyphenols against Various Gastro-Intestinal Disorders: A Mini-Review with Special Focus on Clinical Evidence.,"Polyphenols are classified as an organic chemical with phenolic units that display an array of biological functions. However, polyphenols have very low bioavailability and stability, which make polyphenols a less bioactive compound. Many researchers have indicated that several factors might affect the efficiency and the metabolism (biotransformation) of various polyphenols, which include the gut microbiota, structure, and physical properties as well as its interactions with other dietary nutrients (macromolecules). Hence, this mini-review covers the two-way interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota (interplay) and how polyphenols are metabolized (biotransformation) to produce various polyphenolic metabolites. Moreover, the protective effects of numerous polyphenols and their metabolites against various gastrointestinal disorders/diseases including gastritis, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) like celiac disease (CED) are discussed. For this review, the authors chose only a few popular polyphenols (green tea polyphenol, curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin), and a discussion of their proposed mechanism underpinning the gastroprotection was elaborated with a special focus on clinical evidence. Overall, this contribution would help the general population and science community to identify a potent polyphenol with strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory properties to combat various gut-related diseases or disorders (complementary therapy) along with modified lifestyle pattern and standard gastroprotective drugs. However, the data from clinical trials are much limited and hence many large-scale clinical trials should be performed (with different form/metabolites and dose) to confirm the gastroprotective activity of the above-mentioned polyphenols and their metabolites before recommendation.",Chiu HF; Venkatakrishnan K; Golovinskaia O; Wang CK,2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",26,7,,10.3390/molecules26072090,"Chiu, H.

METHODS: For this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to Feb 7, 2025, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing an active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food in IBS with either a control intervention, such as a habitual diet, sham diet, a high fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet, or alternative miscellaneous dietary advice, or any other active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food. We assessed efficacy using dichotomous assessments of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. We pooled data using a random-effects model, with the efficacy of each intervention reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. We ranked interventions according to their P-score, which measures the mean extent of certainty that one intervention is better than another, averaged over all competing interventions.
FINDINGS: We identified 28 eligible randomised controlled trials (comprising 2338 patients) of 11 different dietary interventions compared with four control interventions, of which six (low FODMAP diet, British Dietetic Association/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [BDA/NICE] diet, lactose-reduced diet, starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet, a personalised diet, and a Mediterranean diet) were studied in more than one trial. For global IBS symptoms, assessed in 28 randomised controlled trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked first (RR of global IBS symptoms not improving 0·41 [95% CI 0·26-0·67]; P-score 0·84; two trials), a low FODMAP diet ranked fourth (0·51 [0·37-0·70]; P-score 0·71; 24 trials), and a BDA/NICE diet ranked tenth (0·62 [0·43-0·90]; P-score 0·44; eight trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal pain, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised controlled trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked second (RR of abdominal pain not improving 0·54 [95% CI 0·33-0·90]; P-score 0·73; two trials), and a low FODMAP diet ranked fifth (0·61 [0·42-0·89]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal bloating or distension, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised trial, only a low FODMAP diet (RR of abdominal bloating or distension not improving 0·55 [95% CI 0·37-0·80]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials) was superior to a habitual diet and ranked fourth. For bowel habit, assessed in 23 randomised trials, none of the dietary interventions was superior to any of the control interventions, but a low FODMAP diet was superior to a BDA/NICE diet (RR of bowel habit not improving 0·79 [95% CI 0·63-0·99]). All comparisons across the network were rated as low or very low confidence, except for direct comparisons between a low FODMAP diet or a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet and habitual diet, both of which were rated as moderate confidence.
INTERPRETATION: In terms of dietary interventions for IBS, the most evidence exists for a low FODMAP diet, but other promising therapies are emerging and should be the subject of further study.

38777133,Effect of Brain-Gut Behavioral Treatments on Abdominal Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some brain-gut behavioral treatments (BGBTs) are beneficial for global symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). United States management guidelines suggest their use in patients with persistent abdominal pain, but their specific effect on this symptom has not been assessed systematically.
METHODS: We searched the literature through December 16, 2023, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of BGBTs for adults with IBS, compared with each other or a control intervention. Trials provided an assessment of abdominal pain resolution or improvement at treatment completion. We extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming dropouts to be treatment failures and reporting pooled relative risks (RRs) of abdominal pain not improving with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), ranking therapies according to the P score.
RESULTS: We identified 42 eligible randomized controlled trials comprising 5220 participants. After treatment completion, the BGBTs with the largest numbers of trials and patients recruited demonstrating efficacy for abdominal pain, specifically, included self-guided/minimal contact cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95; P score, 0.58), face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97; P score, 0.56), and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96; P score, 0.49). Among trials recruiting only patients with refractory global IBS symptoms, group CBT was more efficacious than routine care for abdominal pain, but no other significant differences were detected. No trials were low risk of bias across all domains, and there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry.
CONCLUSIONS: Several BGBTs, including self-guided/minimal contact CBT, face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy, and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy may be efficacious for abdominal pain in IBS, although none was superior to another.",Goodoory VC; Khasawneh M; Thakur ER; Everitt HA; Gudleski GD; Lackner JM; Moss-Morris R; Simren M; Vasant DH; Moayyedi P; Black CJ; Ford AC,2024,Gastroenterology,167,5,934-943.e5,10.1053/j.gastro.2024.05.010,"Goodoory, V.

37385235,Adiponectin Levels in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Adipose tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions. The role of adipokines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been evaluated in the current literature with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate adiponectin levels in IBD patients, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), compared to controls, as well as further subgroup analyses. Hence, assessing the potential role of adiponectin as a surrogate marker.
METHODS: We performed a systematic electronic search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, including observational or interventional studies evaluating serum or plasma adiponectin levels in IBD patients in humans. The primary summary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in serum or plasma adiponectin levels between IBD patients versus controls. Subgroup analyses were conducted involving adiponectin levels in CD and UC compared to controls, as well as CD compared to UC.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were included in our qualitative synthesis and 14 studies in our quantitative synthesis, with a total population sample of 2,085 subjects. No significant MD in serum adiponectin levels was observed between IBD patients versus controls {-1.331 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.135-0.472)}, UC patients versus controls (-0.213 [95% CI: -1.898-1.472]), and CD patients versus controls (-0.851 [95% CI: -2.263-0.561]). Nevertheless, a significant MD was found between UC patients versus CD patients (0.859 [95% CI: 0.097-1.622]).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin levels were not able to differentiate between IBD, UC, and CD patients compared to controls. However, significantly higher serum adiponectin levels were observed in UC compared to CD patients.",Surdea-Blaga T; Ismaiel A; Jaaouani A; Leucuta DC; Elsayed A; Ismaiel M; Ben Ameur I; Al Srouji N; Popa SL; Grad S; Ensar D; Dumitrascu DL,2023,"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",41,6,860-871,10.1159/000531614,"Surdea-Blaga, T., Ismaiel, A., Jaaouani, A., Leucuta, D.

39835671,An evidence-based update on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction affecting 5% of the population. The cardinal symptoms are abdominal pain and altered stool form or frequency.
AREAS COVERED: Diagnosis and management of IBS. We searched the literature for diagnostic accuracy studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses. A positive diagnosis of IBS, alongside testing to exclude celiac disease, is recommended. Exhaustive investigation has a low yield. Patients should be offered traditional dietary advice. If response is incomplete, specialist dietetic guidance should be considered. Probiotics may be beneficial, but quality of evidence is poor. First-line treatment of constipation is with laxatives, with secretagogues used where these are ineffective. Anti-diarrheal drugs should be used first-line for diarrhea, with second-line drugs including 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists, eluxadoline, or rifaximin, where available. First-line treatment of abdominal pain should be with antispasmodics, with gut-brain neuromodulators prescribed second-line. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are preferred. Brain-gut behavioral therapies are effective and have evidence for efficacy in patients refractory to standard therapies.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite substantial advances, there remains scope for improvement in terms of both the diagnosis and management of IBS. Reinforcement of positive diagnostic strategies for the condition and novel treatment paradigms are required.",Black CJ; Ford AC,2025,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,,,1-16,10.1080/17474124.2025.2455586,"Black, C.

36776657,Rectal Hypersensitivity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Abdominal pain is a key symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in active IBD, but also occurs in patients with quiescent disease suggesting that mechanisms other than active inflammation may be responsible. Putative hypothesis to explain chronic abdominal pain in patients with quiescent IBD includes crossover with irritable bowel syndrome where rectal hypersensitivity is common and has pathophysiological implications. In contrast, in IBD, the role of rectal hypersensitivity has not been established. We aimed to determine if rectal hypersensitivity was more common in IBD compared to a healthy control population. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1970-2018). Prospective studies that measured pain/discomfort thresholds to mechanical rectal stimuli in IBD and healthy controls were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis and effect sizes were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our search strategy identified 222 citations of which 8 met the inclusion criteria, covering 133 individuals with IBD (67 men), aged between 10 and 77 compared to 99 healthy controls (55 men), aged between 10 and 67. The prevalence of rectal hypersensitivity in IBD compared to healthy controls was similar with an effect size of 0.59 (95% CIs: -0.27 to 1.44, P = .16, I 2 = 87.3%). Subgroup analysis did show a significant effect size for patients compared to healthy controls with active disease (1.32) but not for quiescent disease (-0.02). These results suggest that reduced rectal pain thresholds to experimental stimulation are not seen in IBD populations except during active flares of the disease. Further research is required to understand the pathophysiology of chronic abdominal pain in quiescent IBD populations with and without chronic abdominal pain to identify appropriate management strategies.",Roberts C; Albusoda A; Farmer AD; Aziz Q,2021,Crohn's & colitis 360,3,3,otab041,10.1093/crocol/otab041,"Roberts, C., Albusoda, A., Farmer, A.

37823411,Systematic review with meta-analysis: Diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome in adults.,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often overlap with those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing patients with IBD from those with IBS METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases up to 1 January 2023. Studies were included if they assessed the diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing IBD from IBS (defined according to the Rome criteria) using colonoscopy with histology or radiology as reference standard in adults. We calculated summary sensitivity and specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effect bivariate model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II.
RESULTS: We included 17 studies with a total of 1956 patients. The summary sensitivity was 85.8% (95% CI: 78.3-91), and the specificity was 91.7% (95% CI: 84.5-95.7). At a prevalence of IBD of 1%, the negative predictive value was 99.8%, while the positive predictive value was only 9%. Subgroup analyses showed a higher sensitivity in Western than in Eastern countries (88% vs 73%) and at a cut-off of ≤50 μg/g than at >50 μg/g (87% vs. 79%), with similar estimates of specificity. All studies were at ""high"" or ""unclear"" risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin is a reliable test in distinguishing patients with IBD from those with IBS. Faecal calprotectin seems to have a better sensitivity in Western countries and at a cut-off of ≤50 μg/g.",Dajti E; Frazzoni L; Iascone V; Secco M; Vestito A; Fuccio L; Eusebi LH; Fusaroli P; Rizzello F; Calabrese C; Gionchetti P; Bazzoli F; Zagari RM,2023,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,58,11-12,1120-1131,10.1111/apt.17754,"Dajti, E., Frazzoni, L., Iascone, V., Secco, M., Vestito, A., Fuccio, L., Eusebi, L.

30996042,Efficacy of pharmacological therapies in patients with IBS with diarrhoea or mixed stool pattern: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Over half of patients with IBS have either diarrhoea (IBS-D) or a mixed stool pattern (IBS-M). The relative efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies is unclear in the absence of head-to-head trials. We conducted a network meta-analysis to resolve this uncertainty.
DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov through January 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies (alosetron, eluxadoline, ramosetron and rifaximin) in adults with IBS-D or IBS-M. Trials included in the analysis reported a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, and data were pooled using a random effects model. Efficacy and safety of all pharmacological therapies were reported as a pooled relative risk with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their p score.
RESULTS: We identified 18 eligible RCTs (seven alosetron, five ramosetron, two rifaximin and four eluxadoline), containing 9844 patients. All were superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS-D or IBS-M at 12 weeks, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoint for trials in IBS. Alosetron 1 mg twice daily was ranked first for efficacy, based on the FDA-recommended composite endpoint of improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency, effect on global symptoms of IBS and effect on stool consistency. Ramosetron 2.5μg once daily was ranked first for effect on abdominal pain. Total numbers of adverse events were significantly greater with alosetron 1 mg twice daily and ramosetron 2.5μg once daily, compared with placebo. Rifaximin 550 mg three times daily ranked first for safety. Constipation was significantly more common with all drugs, except rifaximin 550 mg three times daily.
CONCLUSION: In a network meta-analysis of RCTs of pharmacological therapies for IBS-D and IBS-M, we found all drugs to be superior to placebo, but alosetron and ramosetron appeared to be the most effective.",Black CJ; Burr NE; Camilleri M; Earnest DL; Quigley EM; Moayyedi P; Houghton LA; Ford AC,2020,Gut,69,1,74-82,10.1136/gutjnl-2018-318160,"Black, C.

39532478,Recent advances in clinical practice: mastering the challenge-managing IBS symptoms in IBD.,"Many patients with IBD report persisting symptoms, despite resolution of the inflammatory process. Although by definition, a diagnosis of IBS cannot be made, the prevalence of 'IBS in IBD' surpasses the rate of IBS in the global population by fivefold. Because IBS-like symptoms are associated with a decreased quality of life and increased healthcare utilisation in IBD, diagnosis and treatment are necessary. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on IBS-like symptoms in IBD. A pathophysiological common ground is present, which includes genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, gut microbial dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity and involvement of brain-gut interaction. When symptoms persist after resolution of inflammation, other GI diseases should be excluded based on the chief complaint, considering any possible psychological co-morbidity early in the diagnostic work-up. Subsequent treatment should be initiated that is evidence-based and often multimodal, including classical and non-classical pharmacological agents as well as lifestyle and microbiota-based approaches, spanning the breadth of the gut, brain and its interaction. Treatment goals in this substantial part of the IBD population should be adapted to not only focus on treating the inflammation but taking care of the patient.",Wellens J; Sabino J; Vanuytsel T; Tack J; Vermeire S,2025,Gut,74,2,312-321,10.1136/gutjnl-2024-333565,"Wellens, J., Sabino, J., Vanuytsel, T., Tack, J., & Vermeire, S.

36827916,"Blood regulatory T cells in inflammatory bowel disease, a systematic review, and meta-analysis.","INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease involving various parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the contradictory results regarding the percentage of peripheral blood (PB) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in IBD patients, this meta-analysis aimed to determine the Tregs frequency in IBD patients.
METHOD: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases for relevant observational articles that analyzed and reported the frequency of PB Tregs in IBD patients and healthy control groups. After choosing the related articles by two reviewers, the data regarding the definition of Tregs and their frequencies in different groups were recorded.
RESULT: In 22 studies, the results showed a nonsignificant difference in the frequency of PB Tregs between IBD cases and control subjects (SMD: -0.27, 95 % CI: -0.78, 0.23). However, the frequency of CD4+CD25+CD127- (SMD: -0.89, 95 % CI: -1.52, -0.26) and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ (SMD: -1.32, 95 % CI: -2.37, -0.26) Tregs were significantly lower in IBD cases, compared to healthy subjects. Also, UC cases and active IBD cases showed a significantly lower frequency of Treg cells, compared to controls and remission IBD cases, respectively (SMD: -0.68, 95 % CI: -1.24, -0.11 and SMD: -0.60, 95 % CI: -0.93, -0.27).
CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted a probable decrease of Tregs in IBD patients, especially the patients with active states of the disease.

36040881,A mean platelet volume in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal tract inflammatory state, which is affecting millions of individuals in the world. It can affect alimentary canals such as colon, rectum, ileum and other parts. In IBD, platelet parameters underwent several changes. Therefore, the aim of this review was determining the estimated pooled mean platelet volume and mean difference in inflammatory bowel disease to elucidate its potential diagnostic value.
METHODS: Articles were extensively searched in bibliographic databases using Medical Subject Heading and entry phrases or terms. In addition, articles were directly searched in Google Scholar to account for the studies omission in searching bibliographic databases. Observational (cohort, cross-sectional and case-control) studies, published in English language and conducted on IBD were included. For studies meeting the eligibility criteria, the first author's name, publication year, population, study design, study area, sample size, mean platelet volume and standard deviation were extracted and entered in to Microsoft-excel. The analysis was done by Stata version 11. In order to estimate the pooled mean platelet volume and mean difference, random effect model was done. The heterogeneity was quantified using Higgin's I2 statistics. Publication bias was determined using Egger's test statistics and funnel plot. Sub-group analysis based on population carried to reduce heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 17 relevant articles with 2957 participants (1823 IBD cases and 1134 healthy controls) were included to this study. The pooled estimated MPV was 9.29fl; 95% CI: 9.01-9.57 and 9.50fl; 95% CI: 8.81-10.20 in IBD and control groups, respectively. The standardized pooled estimate of mean difference in mean platelet volume was -0.83fl; 95% CI: -1.15, -0.51; I2: 93.1%; P-value < 0.001. In subgroup analysis based on population, the highest estimated mean difference in MPV was observed among patients of CD; -2.30; 95% CI: -3.46, -1.14; I2: 97.8%; P-value < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: According to the current systematic review and meta-analysis, mean platelet volume was lower in IBD compared to control. The decreased mean platelet volume could be attributed to platelet consumption or sequestration associated with the progression of IBD. As a result, in IBD, mean platelet volume can provide diagnostic and prognostic information.",Bambo GM; Shiferaw E; Melku M,2022,PloS one,17,8,e0273417,10.1371/journal.pone.0273417,"Bambo, G.

34908158,Association between irritable bowel syndrome and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) share similar pathological mechanisms and risk factors.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for a relationship between IBS and PD. Risk estimates from individual studies were pooled using random-effects models.
RESULTS: Six articles involving 58,645 patients with PD were included in our meta-analysis. The overall risk for PD in IBS patients was significantly higher than that in the general population (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-1.75; p < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in risk between men (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.3-1.67; p < .001) and women (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.29-1.75; p < .001); however, older (≥65 years) IBS patients (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.3-1.59; p < .001) may be at higher risk for PD than younger (40-64 years) patients (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.64; p = .017).
CONCLUSION: Overall, the PD risk was higher in IBS patients than others, indicating that the intestinal disorder may serve as a warning sign for PD.",Lu S; Jiang HY; Shi YD,2022,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,145,4,442-448,10.1111/ane.13570,"Lu, S., Jiang, H.

METHODS: Databases were searched up to July 2022 to identify eligible studies that assessed the risk of MACEs in patients (age≥18 years) with IBD treated with biologic therapies and small molecules. Primary outcome was the rate of MACEs observed in patients receiving biologic or small molecules therapies during induction and maintenance phases of RCTs.
RESULTS: In total 64 studies were included in the analysis. 22 RCTs involving 12,196 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were included and 32 RCTs involving 22,007 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In patients with CD, risk of MACE was not higher than placebo during induction or maintenance phases, infliximab (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.07-6.14) and ustekinumab (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03-8.04). In patients with UC, risk of MACE was not higher than placebo, tofacitinib (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.15-11.21) and upadcitinib (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03-7.97) during induction or maintenance.
CONCLUSION: The use of biologic therapies and small molecules among adult patients with IBD had no significant impact on the risk of MACEs during induction and maintenance period of RCTs. Real world data is warranted to assess long-term risks.",Shehab M; Alrashed F; Alkazemi A; Lakatos PL; Bessissow T,2023,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,17,5,469-477,10.1080/17474124.2023.2194631,"Shehab, M., Alrashed, F., Alkazemi, A., Lakatos, P.

33370548,Association between periodontal disease and inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the association between periodontal disease (PD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched articles in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and LILACS published until March 2020. Observational studies evaluating the coexistence of PD in IBD and reported values of clinical periodontal parameters, or radiographic bone loss; and IBD diagnosis established by clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological criteria were deemed eligible.
RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included (33,216 individuals). Only one study reported longitudinal data on IBDs onset in patients with PD. Several case-control studies reported coexistence. Meta-analysis showed that the presence of PD was associated with IBD (2.78 [95%CI 1.36-5.69]). PD was strongly associated both with CD (3.41 [95%CI 1.36-8.56]) and UC (3.98 [95%CI 2.02-7.87]).
CONCLUSION: This review presents clear evidence for an association between PD and IBDs. Future studies should avoid non-longitudinal designs and focus on addressing direction. PD screening may be included in the multidisciplinary management of IBD patients. The mere theoretical possibility that PD may predispose to IBDs may be of key significance due to the rising incidence of diseases.",Lorenzo-Pouso AI; Castelo-Baz P; Rodriguez-Zorrilla S; Pérez-Sayáns M; Vega P,2021,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,79,5,344-353,10.1080/00016357.2020.1859132,"Lorenzo-Pouso, A.

36858143,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Efficacy of Mesalamine in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) demonstrate low-grade inflammation in the intestine. Mesalamine, which has anti-inflammatory effects, may be an efficacious treatment for IBS, but studies are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of mesalamine in IBS.
METHODS: We searched the medical literature up to September 14, 2022, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mesalamine in IBS. We judged efficacy and safety using dichotomous assessments of effect on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain, bowel habit or stool frequency, and occurrence of any adverse event. We pooled data using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We identified 8 eligible RCTs (820 patients). Mesalamine was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptoms (RR of global symptoms not improving, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95; number needed to treat = 10; 95% CI, 6-27), but not for abdominal pain or bowel habit or stool frequency. Subgroup analyses demonstrated efficacy of mesalamine in IBS with diarrhea for global IBS symptoms (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99), but not patients with other predominant bowel habits or those with post-infection IBS. Adverse event rates were no higher with mesalamine (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.89-1.63) but were reported in only 5 trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Mesalamine may be modestly efficacious for global symptoms in IBS, particularly IBS with diarrhea, but quality of evidence was low. Adequately powered high quality RCTs of mesalamine in IBS are needed.",Goodoory VC; Tuteja AK; Black CJ; Ford AC,2024,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,22,2,243-251.e5,10.1016/j.cgh.2023.02.014,"Goodoory, V.

32973596,Alexithymia and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Given the role of alexithymia-as the inability to identify, differentiate, and express emotions-in chronic and immune-mediated illness, this systematic review analyzed the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), mainly represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed throughout this systematic review of the literature published between 2015 and 2020 in indexed sources from PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Search terms for eligible studies were: ""Inflammatory bowel disease"" AND ""Alexithymia"" [Titles, Abstract, Keywords]. Inclusion criteria were: articles written and published in English from 2015 and up to April 2020, reporting relevant and empirical data on alexithymia and IBD. Results: The initial search identified 34 indexed scientific publications. After screening, we found that five publications met the established scientific inclusion criteria. Overall, the mean value of alexithymia ranged from 39 to 53.2 [Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) score], thus mostly falling in non-clinical range for alexithymia (≤51). Comparisons of alexithymia between patients with UC and CD highlighted that patients with CD showed externally oriented thinking and difficulties identifying feelings to a greater extent. Regarding comparisons with other samples or pathologies, patients with IBD were more alexithymic than healthy controls and less alexithymic than patients with major depressive disorder, but no difference was found when compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Then, regarding correlations with other variables, alexithymia was positively associated with anxiety and depression, as well as with psychopathological symptoms and somatic complaints. Conclusion: This systematic review suggests that patients with IBD cannot be generally considered alexithymic at a clinically relevant extent. However, their greater alexithymic levels and its associations with psychological variables and somatic distress may suggest a reactivity hypothesis, in which living with IBD may progressively lead to impaired emotion recognition over time. Specifically, the relationship between IBD and IBS should be further explored, paying deeper attention to the clinical psychological functioning of CD, as IBD requires more emotional challenges to patients.",Martino G; Caputo A; Schwarz P; Bellone F; Fries W; Quattropani MC; Vicario CM,2020,Frontiers in psychology,11,,1763,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01763,"Martino, G., Caputo, A., Schwarz, P., Bellone, F., Fries, W., Quattropani, M.

34110640,Systematic review and meta-analysis: Safety of vedolizumab during pregnancy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vedolizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, often affecting women of child-bearing age. We aimed to compare maternal and fetal adverse outcomes in pregnancies of women with inflammatory bowel disease exposed to vedolizumab versus those on other treatment.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search through December 2020 looking for studies including outcomes from pregnancies of female inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with vedolizumab. Our primary outcome was a composite of adverse pregnancy-related events in pregnancies of female patients on vedolizumab compared with those of disease-matched controls on other medication regimens. Events of interest included preterm births, early loss of pregnancy, late fetal death, elective termination of pregnancy, and congenital anomalies.
RESULTS: Four studies were included in our review meeting criteria for our primary analysis. Compared with those with no vedolizumab exposure, pregnancies with vedolizumab exposure had an increase in overall adverse pregnancy-related outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-3.13). The vedolizumab group also had increased preterm births (OR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.28-3.66), and early loss of pregnancies (OR 1.79, 95% CI, 1.06-3.01) but no difference in number of live births (OR 0.60, 95%CI, 0.36-1.00), or congenital malformations (OR 1.56, 95% CI, 0.56-4.37).
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review highlights possible concern with the general safety of vedolizumab in pregnancy, as an increase in overall total unfavorable outcomes was observed. Premature births and early loss of pregnancy were also more prevalent in pregnant female patients on vedolizumab. It is possible these findings are confounded by disease activity, and further prospective cohort studies of vedolizumab and pregnancy outcomes are warranted.",Bell C; Tandon P; Lentz E; Marshall JK; Narula N,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,10,2640-2648,10.1111/jgh.15574,"Bell, C., Tandon, P., Lentz, E., Marshall, J.

37937498,Risk of allergic rhinitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous parallels exist between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and allergic rhinitis (AR), which include risk factors (such as environmental and genetic factors), pathogenesis (immune disorders, epithelial cell barriers, etc.), and treatment (immunosuppressants and immunomodulators, such as cyclosporine and steroids). However, the risk of AR in IBD patients is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, patients with IBD are examined for their risk of AR.
METHODS: Several databases are accessible in both Chinese and English, including PubMed, BioRXiv, WanFang, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, METSTR, and MedRxiv. Findings presented at allergy, rhinology, thoracic, and gastrointestinal conferences were analyzed. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two evaluators independently retrieved data, read the literature, and evaluated bias risk. The data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. Case-control and cohort studies were eligible study designs for this research.
RESULTS: There were 10 case-control studies and 1 cohort study included in the meta-analysis. The experimental group consisted of 65,687 IBD patients, of whom 5838 had AR. A total of 345,176 participants without IBD were included in the control group, of whom 24,625 developed AR. The outcomes demonstrated that IBD patients had a higher risk of developing AR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 1.95], Z = 2.78, P = 0.005) than those without IBD.
CONCLUSION: The risk of AR is higher in IBD patients. Further investigation is required to determine the mechanism behind the association between AR and IBD.",Liu J; Cai L; Yang R; Wei L; Luo H; Gui X,2023,Allergologia et immunopathologia,51,6,67-75,10.15586/aei.v51i6.943,"Liu, J., Cai, L., Yang, R., Wei, L., Luo, H., & Gui, X.

32464244,Candidate polymorphisms and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: The goal of our study is to investigate the contribution of the 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: A total of 44 articles were retrieved from bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, SpingerLink, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. Through a comprehensive filtering procedure, 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were collected in the meta-analysis, which was done by Review Manager 5.0.
RESULTS: After a systematic filtration, there were 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 44 articles involved in our meta-analysis. Our results demonstrated that 3 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with CD/UC/IBD: IRF5 rs4728142 (UC: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.09-1.35, P = 0.0003; OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.57, P = 0.006 in Asian), PTGER4 rs4613763 (CD: the overall OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.64, P = 0.04; IBD: OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.04-1.65, P = 0.02), IL12B rs6887695 (CD: the overall OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.06-1.30, P = 0.002; UC: the overall OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01-1.26, P = 0.03; IBD: the overall OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24, P = 0.0009).

34114657,Systematic review and network meta-analysis: efficacy of licensed drugs for abdominal bloating in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.,"BACKGROUND: Although bloating is a highly prevalent and troublesome symptom in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), treatment is empirical with no specific guidelines for its management.
AIM: To conduct a pairwise and network meta-analysis, using a frequentist approach, of Food and Drug Administration-licensed drugs for IBS-C comparing their efficacy for abdominal bloating as a specific endpoint.
METHODS: We searched the medical literature through December 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in IBS-C, with abdominal bloating reported as a dichotomous assessment. Efficacy of each drug was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, containing 10 091 patients. Linaclotide 290 μg o.d., lubiprostone 8 μg b.d., tenapanor 50 mg b.d. and tegaserod 6 mg b.d. were all superior to placebo for abdominal bloating in patients with IBS-C, in both pairwise and the network meta-analyses. Linaclotide demonstrated the greatest improvement in abdominal bloating in both pairwise and network meta-analysis (RR of failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal bloating = 0.78; 95% CI 0.74-0.83, number needed to treat = 7, P-score 0.97). Indirect comparison revealed no significant differences between individual drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: We found all licensed drugs for IBS-C to be superior to placebo for abdominal bloating. Linaclotide appeared to be the most efficacious at relieving abdominal bloating. Further research is needed to assess long-term efficacy of these agents and to better understand the precise mechanism of improving bloating.",Nelson AD; Black CJ; Houghton LA; Lugo-Fagundo NS; Lacy BE; Ford AC,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,2,98-108,10.1111/apt.16437,"Nelson, A.

36990003,The effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in inflammatory bowel disease: A Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Mental health has been identified as contributing to the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Resultingly, psychotherapeutic interventions, such as Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI), have been increasingly investigated for improving IBD outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the current state of evidence of MBI's for individuals living with IBD.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review searching Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane and Scopus, to identify controlled clinical trials, investigating MBI's for various IBD biopsychosocial outcomes. Data was pooled using the inverse-variance random effects model, with restricted maximum likelihood estimation, providing the standardized mean difference (SMD) between control and experimental groups, at both short and long-term follow up.
RESULTS: We identified 8 studies with 575 participants. Meta-analytic results found that MBI's were more efficacious than control groups in the short-term improvement of stress (SMD = -0.38, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.10], p = 0.007), mindfulness (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.36, 0.83], p = 0.00001), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.49, -0.01], p = 0.04) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI [0.24, 0.66], p = 0.0001) (including all emotional, bowel, social and systemic subscales). This was maintained in the long-term for stress (SMD = -0.44, 95% CI [-0.88, -0.01], p < 0.05) and mindfulness (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI [0.14, 0.90], p = 0.008), but not for HRQoL, with no long-term data available for CRP.

37565634,Probiotics for the management of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and three-level meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Previous systematic reviews demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, these studies are either affected by the inclusion of insufficient trials or by the problem of dependent data across multiple outcomes, and an overall effect size has not been provided. We aimed to determine the effect of probiotics on IBS through a three-level meta-analysis and clarify potential effect moderators.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, screening for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the effect of probiotics on IBS. The primary outcome was the improvement in the severity of global IBS symptoms at the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the improvement in abdominal pain and the quality of life. The effect sizes of the probiotics were measured by using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled by a three-level meta-analysis model.
RESULTS: We included 72 RCTs in the analysis. The meta-analysis showed significantly better overall effect of probiotics than placebo on the global IBS symptoms (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.34, P <0.001), abdominal pain (SMD -0.89, 95% CI -1.29 to -0.5, P <0.001) and quality of life (SMD 0.99, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.54, P <0.001), respectively. Moderator analysis found that a treatment duration shorter than 4 weeks was associated with a larger effect size in all the outcomes, and Bacillus probiotics had better improvement on the abdominal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics had a short-term effect and a medium effect size on the global IBS symptoms. Treatment duration and types of probiotics affected the effect size of probiotics, and shorter durations and Bacillus probiotics were associated with better treatment effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Google Scholar, LILACS, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were screened. Caries experience was measured through the Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval was calculated between IBD patients and healthy controls.
RESULTS: Six studies were selected for the inclusion in the systematic review, 5 of which were also included in the quantitative synthesis of data. The WMD in the DMFT index between IBD and healthy subjects was 3.04 (1.52, 4.56) (p = 0.10). Subgroup analysis showed no difference (p = 0.31) between CD (2.52 [0.54, 4.49]) and UC (4.01 [1.52, 4.56]) subjects.

34946184,Gut Bacteria and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"Bacteria in the gut microbiome plays an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. Apart from physiological and structural changes brought about by gut bacteria on entero-epithelial cells and mucus layers, a vast number of signals generated in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) reaches the brain via the vagus nerve. Research on the gut-brain axis (GBA) has mostly been devoted to digestive functions and satiety. Less papers have been published on the role gut microbiota play in mood, cognitive behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression and schizophrenia. Whether we will be able to fully decipher the connection between gut microbiota and mental health is debatable, especially since the gut microbiome is diverse, everchanging and highly responsive to external stimuli. Nevertheless, the more we discover about the gut microbiome and the more we learn about the GBA, the greater the chance of developing novel therapeutics, probiotics and psychobiotics to treat gastro-intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but also improve cognitive functions and prevent or treat mental disorders.

36682029,Systematic Review with Meta-analysis: The Impact of Cancer Treatments on the Disease Activity of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between cancer treatments and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effects of cancer treatments on the disease activity of IBD.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature on cancer therapy in patients with pre-existing IBD. Electronic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase were combined with manual searches (September 2021). Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. The primary outcome was flares of IBD following cancer therapy. Secondary outcomes were need for IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and initiation or intensification of steroid or biological treatments to manage IBD flares.
RESULTS: In total, 33 studies were included in the systematic review, comprising 1298 patients with IBD who received cancer treatment. The overall occurrence of IBD flares following cancer treatment was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23-37%). IBD flares resulted in utilization of systemic steroids and biologic therapies among 25% and 10% of patients, respectively, and in discontinuation of cancer treatment among 14% of patients. Finally, the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity following immune check point inhibitor treatment [ICI] was increased in patients with IBD compared to patients without IBD (RR = 3.62 [95% CI 2.57-5.09]). Despite this, the studies generally reported that flares were manageable.
CONCLUSIONS: Current data indicate a high proportion of patients with IBD experiencing a flare following the start of cancer treatment. Patients with IBD were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity following ICI treatment compared to those without IBD. However, cancer therapy-induced IBD flares were manageable and should not preclude appropriate cancer treatments.",Grimsdottir S; Attauabi M; Kristine Dahl E; Burisch J; Seidelin JB,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,7,1139-1153,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad010,"Grimsdottir, S., Attauabi, M., Kristine Dahl, E., Burisch, J., & Seidelin, J.

37116651,The association of antibiotic exposure with new-onset inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The role of antibiotics in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains controversial, primarily due to conflicting data from individual studies. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the effect of antibiotic exposure on IBD development.
METHODOLOGY: The MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were queried from their inception to April 2021 for published articles studying the association between antibiotic exposure and new-onset IBD. Our analysis was stratified by timing of antibiotic exposure - exposure in childhood and any lifetime exposure. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: 10 case-control studies and 2 cohort studies (N = 29,880 IBD patients and N = 715,548 controls) were included. Patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), compared with controls, were associated significantly with antibiotic exposure in childhood and any lifetime exposure to antibiotics (OR 1.52 [1.23-1.87]; p<0.00001). Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), compared with controls, reported non-significant association with antibiotic exposure in childhood and any lifetime exposure. (OR 1.11 [0.93-1.33]; p = 0.25) CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that exposure to antibiotics significantly increases the odds of developing CD and IBD. These findings re-emphasize the importance of cautious and judicious use of antibiotics.",Dar SH; Maniya MT; Merza N; Musheer A; Zahid M; Ahmed F; Shurjeel Q; Qazi S; Ahmed A; Shah H; Zafar A; Iqbal AZ; Khan SF; Rizwan T; Ligresti R,2023,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,47,6,102129,10.1016/j.clinre.2023.102129,"Dar, S.

38024368,"Gluten restriction in irritable bowel syndrome, yes or no?: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: More than half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) report aggravating their symptoms with certain foods. Currently, Low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) is the most accepted dietary intervention for IBS. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been suggested that gluten restriction may reduce the symptoms of patients with IBS. However, the results from these studies are conflicting. This study filled this knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on IBS symptoms.
METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 2023. A random-effect model was applied to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome.
RESULTS: A total of nine controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. In contrast to gluten-containing diet, GFD was unable to reduce overall symptoms (SMD - 0.31; 95% CI -0.92, 0.31), bloating (SMD -0.37; 95% CI -1.03, 0.30), and quality of life (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.64, 0.39); but had a slight trend to reduce abdominal pain (SMD -0.68; 95% CI -1.36, -0.00). Also, LFD significantly reduced the IBS-Severity score system (SMD 0.66, 95% CI 0.31, 1.01) and improved quality of life (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.70, -0.01), compared to GFD.
CONCLUSION: A GFD is not robust enough to be routinely recommended for IBS patients, and its efficacy is significantly lower than that of an LFD. Only a certain subgroup of IBS patients may benefit from GFD; further studies are needed to target this subgroup.",Arabpour E; Alijanzadeh D; Sadeghi A; Khoshdel S; Hekmatdoost A; Kord-Varkaneh H; Abdehagh M,2023,Frontiers in nutrition,10,,1273629,10.3389/fnut.2023.1273629,"Arabpour, E., Alijanzadeh, D., Sadeghi, A., Khoshdel, S., Hekmatdoost, A., Kord-Varkaneh, H., & Abdehagh, M.

34849941,Safety of Immunizations for the Adult Patient With Inflammatory Bowel Disease-A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have low vaccination rates for vaccine-preventable diseases. Fear of adverse reactions (AEs) appear to negatively affect vaccination efforts. We aimed to systemically review the risks for AEs following immunization for patients with IBD.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase until April 15, 2020, for studies evaluating the safety of vaccinations among patients with IBD. The primary outcome was the incidence of systemic and local AEs among vaccinated patients. Secondary outcome was the rate of IBD flare following immunization. We utilized a random effects meta-analysis of proportions using the DerSimonian-Laird approach to estimate the safety of immunizations.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies with 2116 patients was included in our analysis after fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Seven studies examined the influenza vaccine, 4 the pneumococcal vaccine, 1 the recombinant zoster vaccine, and 1 the hepatitis B vaccine. Follow-up of patients was up to 6 months. The majority of AEs were local, with a pooled incidence of 24% (95% CI, 9%-42%) for all vaccines. Systemic AEs were mostly mild, without resulting in hospitalizations or deaths, with a pooled incidence of 16% (95% CI, 6%-29%) for all vaccines. Flare of inflammatory bowel disease after vaccination found with a pooled incidence of 2% (95% CI, 1%-4%) and we include in the analysis data from all immunizations examined.
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that AEs after vaccination are mainly local or mildly systemic and do not differ significantly from the expected AE after recommended immunizations for the general population. Thus, gastroenterologists should reinforce that vaccines are safe in patients with IBD.",Desalermos A; Pimienta M; Kalligeros M; Shehadeh F; Diamantopoulos L; Karamanolis G; Caldera F; Farraye FA,2022,Inflammatory bowel diseases,28,9,1430-1442,10.1093/ibd/izab266,"Desalermos, A., Pimienta, M., Kalligeros, M., Shehadeh, F., Diamantopoulos, L., Karamanolis, G., Caldera, F., & Farraye, F.

32497689,Bidirectional relationship between atopic dermatitis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, atopic dermatitis has been suggested as a systemic inflammatory disorder that can accompany other inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, comprehensive reviews that specifically focus on the association between inflammatory bowel disease and atopic dermatitis are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between inflammatory bowel disease and atopic dermatitis.
METHODS: We searched for relevant studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to November 22, 2019. Considering a potential bidirectional relationship, studies reporting inflammatory bowel disease in patients with atopic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease were evaluated separately.
RESULTS: We included 10 studies with 95,291,110 patients (4 studies on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in inflammatory bowel disease, 2 on the prevalence and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in atopic dermatitis, and 4 on either the prevalence or incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in atopic dermatitis). Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant association between inflammatory bowel disease and atopic dermatitis in both directions (4 studies on atopic dermatitis prevalence in inflammatory bowel disease, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.50; 5 on inflammatory bowel disease prevalence in atopic dermatitis, odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.73; and 3 studies on inflammatory bowel disease incidence in atopic dermatitis, relative risk 1.46, 95% confidence interval 0.98-2.17).
LIMITATIONS: A small number of observational studies were reviewed.

32385487,Vitamin D Therapy in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Emerging literature suggests that optimization of vitamin D levels may be associated with improvements in disease activity and quality of life. We conducted a meta-analysis exploring the effect of vitamin D on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25[OH]D) levels, clinical improvement, and biomarkers.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and sources for grey literature were searched from inception until September 2019. The primary outcome was s-25(OH)D mean differences. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ 2 test and the I2 statistic. Review Manager software v. 5.3 was used.
RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials (n = 611) and 4 observational studies (n = 359) were included in the meta-analysis. On average, in the randomized controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation increased s-25(OH)D levels by 15.50 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.08-19.92, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 90%) and in observational studies they increased by 18.39 ng/mL (95% CI, 8.91-27.88, P = 0.0001, I2 = 82%). Subgroup analyses between vitamin D and placebo groups revealed that vitamin D increased s-25(OH)D by 14.85 ng/mL (95% CI, 9.96-19.73, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 90%) and when high doses of vitamin D were compared with low doses, high doses increased s-25(OH)D by 18.27 ng/mL (95% CI, 5.44-31.10, P = 0.005, I2 = 90%). The Harvey Bradshaw Index improved by -1.47 points (95% CI, -2.47 to -0.47, P = 0.004, I2 = 0%) and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased by -1.58 mg/L (95% CI, -2.95 to -0.21, P = 0.02, I2 = 0%).

38432204,Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inpatients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are three times more likely to develop venous thromboembolism (VTE), and guidelines recommend prophylaxis during all hospitalizations. In this systematic review, we sought to assess for the benefits and risks of VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized IBD patients.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE and others up to 2/2022, for studies on IBD inpatients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization, compared to no prophylaxis. Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were any VTE and major bleeding, respectively. Results were pooled using random-effects models, calculating odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess bias.
RESULTS: We extracted data from 18 observational studies and 2 randomized-trial subgroups. The studies were highly variable regarding the included populations, interventions, and outcome definitions. Meta-analysis of all studies showed a nonsignificant effect of prophylaxis on VTEs (OR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.49-1.95]). An analysis of eight lower-risk-of-bias studies showed a significant reduction in VTEs (OR: 0.27 [95% CI: 0.13-0.55], number needed to treat (NNT) 34.8 [95% CI: 26.8-49.8]). A significant protective effect persisted in several subgroups. Major bleeding was reported in three studies and showed a significant increase with prophylaxis (OR: 2.02 [95% CI: 1.11-3.67], number needed to harm (NNH) 113.6 [95% CI: 40.7-very-large-number]).
CONCLUSION: In studies with lower-risk-of-bias, a significant reduction in VTEs was shown in patients treated with VTE prophylaxis (NNT = 35), which should be carefully considered against an increased major-bleeding risk (NNH = 114). However, current data are limited and randomized trials dedicated to IBD inpatients would aid in understating whether universal prophylaxis should be recommended.",McNeil R; Fredman D; Eldar O; Gafter-Gvili A; Avni T,2024,Acta haematologica,147,6,702-715,10.1159/000538086,"McNeil, R., Fredman, D., Eldar, O., Gafter-Gvili, A., & Avni, T.

38661391,Systematic review with meta-analysis: effects of probiotic fungi on irritable bowel syndrome.,"Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains challenging for clinicians. Probiotic fungi may act as candidate options for IBS treatment, but systematic evaluation of their clinical value remains scarce. This study is aimed to assess the efficacy and the safety of probiotic fungi for IBS treatment by means of systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, were searched up to June 2022. Randomised controlled trials recruited subjects with prescriptions of probiotic fungi were eligible. Efficacy and safety of probiotic fungi were re-evaluated. Continuous data were pooled to obtain standardised difference in means (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval. The search strategy identified 120 articles of which 7 trial assessing 883 subjects were included in the analysis. Systematic data support that Saccharomyces helps to relieve abdominal pain/discomfort (SMD = -0.205, P = 0.005), and presented potential improvements on psychological outcomes, stool form for IBS patients. It is hard to demonstrate favourable effects on other symptoms (including distension, mucus passage, sense of incomplete evacuation, urgency, straining). The incidence of mild complications ranged from 0 to 51.4%, but no serious complications were observed in the included trials. Therefore, the partial response and the relative safe of probiotic fungi for IBS treatment have been demonstrated from the existing trials. However, it is premature to eventually declare the practical effects of probiotic fungi. Conducting more high-quality and large-scale trials and real-world studies, or even developing new fungal strains, is still necessary.",Qing Q; Chen Y; Zheng DK; Sun ML; Xie Y; Zhang SH,2023,Beneficial microbes,14,4,303-315,10.1163/18762891-20220134,"Qing, Q., Chen, Y., Zheng, D.

36649166,Systematic review with meta-analysis: Stress-management interventions for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder of unknown pathological origin that is associated with psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We investigated the effects of stress-management for adults with IBS on typical symptoms, HRQoL and mental health. With predefined criteria (patients: adults with IBS; intervention: stress-management; control: care as usual or waitlist; outcome: patient-relevant; study-type: controlled trials), we registered the study with PROSPERO (168030) and searched the main medical databases. Two researchers independently reviewed the publications and assessed the risk of bias using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist. We performed meta-analysis with homogeneous trials of acceptable quality. After screening 6656 publications, ten suitable randomized trials of acceptable (n = 5) or low methodological quality (n = 5) involving 587 patients were identified. Our meta-analysis showed no effect of stress-management on IBS severity 1-2 months after the intervention (Hedges' g = -0.23, 95%-CI = -0.84 to -0.38, I2 = 86.1%), and after 3-12 months (Hedges' g = -0.77, 95%-CI = -1.77 to -0.23, I2 = 93.3%). One trial found a short-term reduction of symptoms, and one trial found symptom relief in the long-term (at 6 months). One of two studies that examined HRQoL found an improvement (after 2 months). One of two studies that examined depression and anxiety found a reduction of these symptoms (after 3 weeks). Stress-management may be beneficial for patients with IBS regarding the short-term reduction of bowel and mental health symptoms, whereas long-term benefits are unclear.

The impact of sex on the disease course and the clinical outcomes not fully understood. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the differences in the clinical outcomes in IBD.
METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was done by searching in the PubMed /MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used the Random-Effects model to estimate risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes and mean difference and hedges' g for continuous outcomes.
RESULT: A total of 44 unique studies were included. Our analysis revealed distinct sex differences in various outcomes of IBD. Anxiety was more prevalent in females (RR: 0.73; 95% CI [0.64, 0.82]) and females in the CD subgroup (RR: 0.76; 95% CI [0.62, 0.93]; p = 0.01. While depression was diagnosed more frequently in females (RR: 0.80; 95% CI [0.66, 0.97] in the total population of the study, subgroup analysis showed no sex difference. Additionally, quality of life scores were worse in females in the total population (Hedges' g: 0.24; 95% CI [0.05, 0.42]) with no significant difference in subgroup analyses. A significantly higher mortality risk was estimated in males (RR: 1.26; 95% CI [1.07, 1.48]) and in subgroup analysis for males with UC (RR: 1.48; 95% CI [1.19, 1.84]; p = 0.00) with no significant difference in CD. Regarding disease location, male patients were less likely to present with proctitis (RR: 0.67; 95% CI [0.50, 0.91]) when compared to females. Males had more frequent indications for surgery (RR: 1.10; 95% CI [1.01, 1.20]), however, no significant difference was found in subgroup analyses for CD or UC. Also, males were older at the time of admission (MD: 1.39 years; 95% CI [0.10, 2.68]). No significant sex differences were found in terms of hospitalization rates or disease behavior.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our meta-analysis shows that males face higher risks of early mortality and require more IBD surgeries, whereas females experience greater levels of anxiety and depression.

37346153,Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder in developed countries and reduces patients' quality of life, hinders their ability to work, and increases health care costs. A growing number of trials have demonstrated an aberrant gut microbiota composition in IBS, also known as 'gut dysbiosis'. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been suggested as a treatment for IBS.
AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of IBS.
METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science up to 24 October 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of FMT compared to placebo (including autologous FMT) in treating IBS. The primary outcome was the number of patients with improvements of symptoms measured using a validated, global IBS symptoms score. Secondary outcomes were changes in quality-of-life scores, non-serious and serious adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95%CI were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, as were the mean differences (MD) and 95%CI for continuous outcomes. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the trials. GRADE criteria were used to assess the overall quality of the evidence.
RESULTS: Eight RCTs (484 participants) were included in the review. FMT resulted in no significant benefit in IBS symptoms three months after treatment compared to placebo (RR 1.19, 95%CI: 0.68-2.10). Adverse events were reported in 97 participants in the FMT group and in 45 participants in the placebo group (RR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.15). One serious adverse event occurred in the FMT group and two in the placebo group (RR 0.42, 95%CI: 0.07-2.60). Endoscopic FMT delivery resulted in a significant improvement in symptoms, while capsules did not. FMT did not improve the quality of life of IBS patients but, instead, appeared to reduce it, albeit non significantly (MD -6.30, 95%CI: -13.39-0.79). The overall quality of the evidence was low due to moderate-high inconsistency, the small number of patients in the studies, and imprecision.

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases (inception to July 2020) to identify studies evaluating efficacy of HBV in patients with IBD. Random effects model was used to calculate the pooled rates and I2 percentage values were used to assess the heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies (2375 patients) were included. Four data sets were available from 2 studies that compared HBV response in patients with IBD against healthy controls. The pooled odds ratio of HBV response in IBD patients was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.05-0.33, P = 0.001).

35641579,Systematic review and meta-analysis: association between obesity/overweight and surgical complications in IBD.,"PURPOSE: While the prevalence of obesity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is rapidly increasing, it is unclear whether obesity affects surgical outcomes in this population. This meta-analysis aims to assess the impact of obesity/overweight on patients undergoing surgery for IBD.
METHODS: Databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Springer) were searched through September 2021. The meta-analysis included patients with surgically treated IBD to investigate the impact of obesity/overweight on this population. Primary outcomes included overall complications, infectious complications, noninfectious complications, and conversion to laparotomy.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies totaling 12,622 IBD patients were enrolled. Compared with nonobese (including overweight) patients, obese IBD patients have increased the risk in terms of overall complications (OR = 1.45, p < 0.001), infectious complications (OR = 1.48, p = 0.003) (especially wound complications), as well as conversion to laparotomy (OR = 1.90, p < 0.001). Among the noninfectious complications, only the incidence of visceral injury (OR = 2.36, p = 0.05) had significantly increased. Compared with non-overweight patients, the risk of developing wound complications (OR = 1.65, p = 0.01) and sepsis (OR = 1.73, p = 0.007) were increased in overweight patients, but the rates of overall complications (OR = 1.04, p = 0.81), infectious complications (OR = 1.31, p = 0.07), and conversion to laparotomy (OR = 1.33, p = 0.08) associated with body mass index (BMI) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor for surgical complications in IBD patients, mainly reflected in infectious complications. Moreover, obese patients seem to have a more common chance of developing surgical complications than overweight patients.",Jiang K; Chen B; Lou D; Zhang M; Shi Y; Dai W; Shen J; Zhou B; Hu J,2022,International journal of colorectal disease,37,7,1485-1496,10.1007/s00384-022-04190-y,"Jiang, K., Chen, B., Lou, D., Zhang, M., Shi, Y., Dai, W., Shen, J., Zhou, B., & Hu, J.

39545600,Vascular endothelial growth factor in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIM: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is linked to inflammation and angiogenesis, indicating a possible role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its main clinical manifestations, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated studies assessing circulating VEGF concentrations in IBD patients and healthy controls, considering the effect of IBD type, sample type and geographical location.
METHODS: A systematic search identified 18 studies (28 group comparators) investigating 1741 IBD patients and 1291 controls. Data were extracted and analysed using standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in IBD patients (SMD = .71, 95% CI .38 to 1.04; p < .001). UC patients showed higher VEGF concentrations than CD patients. Serum samples indicated significant VEGF elevations, unlike plasma samples. Significant VEGF increases were observed in studies conducted in Western Europe and Asia, but not in Eastern Europe. No significant differences were found between active and inactive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: VEGF concentrations are elevated in IBD patients, with variations by disease type, sample type and geography. However, VEGF is not a reliable marker of disease activity. Future research should standardize methods and explore regional influences to enhance VEGF's clinical utility as a biomarker of IBD.",Zoroddu S; Di Lorenzo B; Paliogiannis P; Mangoni AA; Carru C; Zinellu A,2025,European journal of clinical investigation,55,3,e14361,10.1111/eci.14361,"Zoroddu, S., Di Lorenzo, B., Paliogiannis, P., Mangoni, A.

39129703,Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Psychological Comorbidities in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, lifelong disease, so IBD patients are highly susceptible to negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression, resulting in a reduced quality of life. Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) is widely used to reduce stress, anxiety and depression in people. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review of mindfulness-based intervention training on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with IBD through meta-analysis.
METHODS: Search papers in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang, and Embase databases. The search time limit was from the establishment of the database to May 2023. Randomized controlled trial studies of the effect of mindfulness intervention training on patients with IBD were screened, the included results were integrated and analyzed, and ReviewManager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with a total of 1030 IBD patients were included. A total of 10 studies showed that the anxiety of patients in the mindfulness intervention group was significantly reduced by (standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.01 to -0.45) compared to the control group. 8 studies showed that the intervention group significantly reduced patients' depression (SMD = -0.60, 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.42). 7 studies showed that the patient's quality of life improved after mindfulness intervention (SMD = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.87).
CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based intervention training can improve anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in the short term, but the long-term effects need to be confirmed by more randomized controlled trials.",Qian X; Zhang J,2024,Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,52,4,571-582,10.62641/aep.v52i4.1559,"Qian, X., & Zhang, J.

37219801,The Effect of Biological Treatment on Fatigue in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent complaint in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Biological drugs have demonstrated beneficial effects on some extraintestinal manifestations, but the effect on fatigue is not clear.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of biological and small molecule drugs approved for inflammatory bowel disease on fatigue.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials reporting Federal Drug Agency (FDA)-approved biological and small molecule drugs for use in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in which measures of fatigue were recorded before and after treatment. Only induction studies were included. Maintenance studies were excluded. We searched Embase (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cinahl (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov in May 2022. Risk of bias was analyzed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Standardized mean difference was used to measure the treatment effect.
RESULTS: A total of seven randomized controlled trials composed of 3835 patients were included in the meta-analysis. All of the studies included patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The studies used three different generic fatigue instruments: the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Vitality Subscale versions 1 and 2. Overall treatment with biological or small molecule agents showed a beneficial effect compared with placebo, with a standardized mean difference of 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.15-0.34, p < 0.001). The effect was independent of type of drug or subtype of inflammatory bowel disease.
DISCUSSION: The risk of bias was considered to be low for all domains except for missing outcome data. Even though the included studies were of high methodological quality, the review is limited by the small number of studies included and that the available studies were not designed to evaluate fatigue specifically.
CONCLUSION: Biological and small molecule drugs used in inflammatory bowel disease have a consistent, though small, beneficial effect on fatigue.",Skjellerudsveen BM; Skoie IM; Dalen I; Grimstad T; Omdal R,2023,Drugs,83,10,909-921,10.1007/s40265-023-01888-3,"Skjellerudsveen, B.

38970234,The association between bilirubin concentrations and inflammatory bowel disease: Insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), poses a significant challenge to health care systems because of its chronic nature and increasing global prevalence. Effective management of IBD requires accurate diagnostic tools and biomarkers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between bilirubin concentrations and IBD activity and outcomes.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases identified 11 studies that included 2606 subjects with IBD and 3607 healthy controls.
RESULTS: Bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with IBD when compared to controls (SMD = -0.96, 95% CI -1.21 to -0.70; p < .001). Although substantial heterogeneity was observed, sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. Publication bias was detected, but subgroup analyses did not significantly alter the results. Meta-regression showed that age was a significant factor influencing the association between bilirubin concentrations and IBD. Subgroup analyses showed a more pronounced reduction in bilirubin concentrations in subjects with CD than those with UC.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the potential utility of bilirubin as a biomarker in IBD, emphasizing the need for further research to validate its clinical significance.",Zoroddu S; Di Lorenzo B; Paliogiannis P; Mangoni AA; Carru C; Zinellu A,2024,European journal of clinical investigation,54,11,e14281,10.1111/eci.14281,"Zoroddu, S., Di Lorenzo, B., Paliogiannis, P., Mangoni, A.

38486190,Circulatory resistin levels in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic relapsing-remitting systemic disease of the gastrointestinal tract with rising incidence. Studies have shown that adipocytes play a crucial role in patients with IBD by actively participating in systemic immune responses. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation between the circulatory levels of resistin, as an adipokine, and active and remission phases of IBD in comparison with healthy controls.
METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and Scopus from inception until June 2023. Estimation of the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for comparison of plasma/serum resistin levels between IBD patients, patients in remission, and healthy controls were conducted through random-effect meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included, assessing 1836 cases. Meta-analysis indicated that generally, serum/plasma resistin levels were higher in IBD patients in comparison with healthy controls (SMD 1.33, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.08, p-value < 0.01). This was true for each of the UC and CD separate analyses, as well. Moreover, it was shown that higher serum/plasma resistin levels were detected in the active phase of IBD than in the remission phase (SMD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.42, p-value = 0.01). Finally, higher serum/plasma resistin levels were found in the remission phase compared to healthy controls (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.06, p-value < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion that circulating resistin levels are increased in IBD (both UC and CD). Also, higher resistin levels were recorded in the remission phase of IBD in comparison with healthy controls. This indicates that further studies may provide valuable insights into the role of resistin in the pathogenesis of IBD.",Behnoush AH; Maroufi SP; Reshadmanesh T; Mohtasham Kia Y; Norouzi M; Mohammadi SM; Klisic A; Khalaji A,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,107,10.1186/s12876-024-03199-7,"Behnoush, A.

36515348,SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META - ANALYSIS OF THE FREQUENCY AND RE-CLASSIFICATION TRENDS OF PEDIATRIC INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE - UNCLASSIFIED.,"BACKGROUND: The term inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBDU) is used when an individual has chronic colitis but cannot be sub-typed into ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) on the basis of the clinical, endoscopic, imaging and histopathological features. On follow-up a proportion of patients with IBDU are re-classified as CD or UC. There has been considerable variability in the frequency and reclassification rates of pediatric IBDU in published literature.
METHODS: PubMed and Scopus and were searched for publications related to Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) published between Jan,2014 and July,2021. Two reviewers independently searched and selected studies reporting the frequency of IBDU and/or their re-classification. The pooled prevalence was expressed as proportion and 95%CI. Meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance heterogeneity model.
RESULTS: A total of 2750 studies were identified through a systematic search of which 27 studies were included in this systematic review. The overall pooled frequency of IBDU (n=16064) was found to be 7.1% (95%CI 5.8-8.5%). There was no variation in IBDU frequency by geographical location. Seven studies (n=5880) were included in the IBDU re-classification analysis. Overall, 50% (95%CI 41-60%) children with IBDU were re-classified on follow-up. Amongst these 32.7% (95% 21-44%) were re-classified to UC and 17% (95%CI 12-22%) were re-classified to CD.
CONCLUSION: IBDU comprises 7.1% of PIBD at initial diagnosis.

31955167,The Bidirectional Association between Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have suggested a significant association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). Yet, outcomes published remain inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between IBD and AD by a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies published from March 1, 1968, to July 26, 2019, was performed in electronic databases as follows: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Methodological quality was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data analysis was conducted using R version 3.6.1 (meta package version 4.9-7).
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies were eligible for exploring the association between IBD and AD. Statistically significant differences were found on the risk of AD comorbidity among patients with IBD (risk ratio [RR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.39-2.40), Crohn's disease (CD; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.61-2.64), and ulcerative colitis (UC; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.23-2.24). Compared with non-AD subjects, patients with AD were 48% (p = 0.019), 44% (p = 0.002), and 38% (p = 0.000) more likely to exhibit IBD, CD as well as UC, respectively.

34630293,Association Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are respectively one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and functional bowel diseases in the world. Recent studies suggest that patients with IBS seem to have a higher risk of PD, which conflicts with the result of previous meta-analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate all available evidence, in order to clarify the association between PD and IBS. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library on April 25, 2021 to identify all records that explore the association between IBS and PD. All reports that clearly define PD and IBS and analyze the relationship between the two were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Results: Five studies from four articles involving 2,044,110 subjects were included in this analysis. The pooled results demonstrated a significant association between PD and IBS (1.48; 95% CI: 1.35-1.62, P < 0.001), with subtle heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.0%, p = 0.585). The association was observed across genders and increased with age. However, the available evidence cannot allow a reliable analysis of the causal relationship between IBS and PD. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a higher risk of PD among subjects with IBS. Future studies are required to further clarify the causation and underlying mechanism of the association.",Zhang X; Svn Z; Liv M; Yang Y; Zeng R; Huang Q; Sun Q,2021,Frontiers in neurology,12,,720958,10.3389/fneur.2021.720958,"Zhang, X., Svn, Z., Liv, M., Yang, Y., Zeng, R., Huang, Q., & Sun, Q.

33721889,Ethnic Differences in the Smoking-related Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between smoking and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] relies on old meta-analyses including exclusively non-Jewish White populations. Uncertainty persists regarding the role of smoking in other ethnicities.
METHODS: We systematically searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for studies examining tobacco smoking and the risk of developing IBD, ie, Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]. Two authors independently extracted study data and assessed each study's risk of bias. We examined heterogeneity and small-study effect, and calculated summary estimates using random-effects models. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were employed to study the association between study-level characteristics and effect estimates. The strength of epidemiological evidence was assessed through prespecified criteria.
RESULTS: We synthesised 57 studies examining the smoking-related risk of developing CD and UC. Non-Jewish White smokers were at increased risk of CD (29 studies; relative risk [RR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69‒2.24; moderate evidence). No association was observed in Asian, Jewish. and Latin-American populations [11 studies; RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.83-1.13], with no evidence of heterogeneity across these ethnicities. Smokers were at reduced risk of UC [51 studies; RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.48-0.64; weak evidence] irrespectively of ethnicity; however, cohort studies, large studies, and those recently published showed attenuated associations.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis did not identify any increased risk of CD in smokers in ethnicities other than non-Jewish Whites, and confirmed the protective effect of smoking on UC occurrence. Future research should characterise the genetic background of CD patients across different ethnicities to improve our understanding of the role of smoking in CD pathogenesis.",Piovani D; Pansieri C; Kotha SRR; Piazza AC; Comberg CL; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S; Bonovas S,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,10,1658-1678,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab047,"Piovani, D., Pansieri, C., Kotha, S.

38189533,Beyond the Gut: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Advanced Therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease-associated Extraintestinal Manifestations.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Extraintestinal manifestations are frequent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and have a negative impact on quality of life. Currently, however, there is no evidence available to determine which drug should be recommended for these patients beyond anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] treatment. We aimed to analyse the frequency of new extraintestinal manifestations and the behaviour of pre-existing extraintestinal manifestations during advanced therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on November 15, 2022, and enrolled randomized controlled trials, cohorts, and case series reporting the occurrence and behaviour of extraintestinal manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving advanced therapy [non-TNF inhibitor biologicals and JAK inhibitors]. Proportions of new, recurring, worsening, and improving extraintestinal manifestations were calculated with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. The risk of bias was assessed with the QUIPS tool.
RESULTS: Altogether, 61 studies comprising 13,806 patients reported eligible data on extraintestinal manifestations. The overall proportion of new extraintestinal manifestations was 8% [95% CI, 6-12%] during advanced therapy. There was no significant difference between the frequency of new extraintestinal manifestations during vedolizumab and ustekinumab therapy [11%, 95% CI, 8-15% vs 6%, 95% CI, 3-11%, p = 0.166]. The improvement of pre-existing manifestations was comparable between vedolizumab- and ustekinumab-treated patients, except for joint involvement [42%, 95% CI, 32-53% vs 54%, 95% CI, 42-65%, p = 0.029].

37024741,Interventions Increase Vaccination Rates in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with immune-mediated conditions such as IBD and RA are at risk for vaccine-preventable infections. Despite guideline recommendations, prior studies have shown suboptimal vaccination rates.
AIM: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the different interventions intended to increase vaccination rates.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library up to 2020 for studies with interventions intended to increase vaccination rates. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to generate pooled odds ratios (ORs) to assess all interventions against no interventions. Our primary outcome was pneumococcal vaccination (PCV) rate.
RESULTS: Our review found 8580 articles, for which 15 IBD and 8 RA articles met the inclusion criteria; 21 articles were included in the analysis. PCV was the predominant vaccination (91%). In our analysis of patients with IBD, almost all interventions (patient-oriented, physician-oriented, or barrier-oriented) increased PCV uptake [OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 2.44-6.56, I2 = 90%] compared to no intervention. The greatest effect was seen in barrier-oriented studies [OR, 12.68; 95% CI, 2.21-72.62, I2 = 92%]. For RA data, all interventions had increased PCV uptake compared to no interventions (OR 2.74; 95% CI, 1.80-4.17, I2 = 95%).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that many different interventions can increase PCV rates. It appears that barrier-oriented interventions may have the greatest positive effect on increasing PCV uptake. However, clinicians should be encouraged to implement measures best suited to their practice. Future high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the best approach to optimize vaccination rates.",Patel J; Noureldin M; Fakhouri D; Farraye FA; Kovar-Gough I; Warren B; Waljee AK; Piper MS,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,7,2921-2935,10.1007/s10620-023-07903-7,"Patel, J., Noureldin, M., Fakhouri, D., Farraye, F.

31913194,Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Case-Control Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and controls.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to December 2018 for studies reporting SIBO prevalence in patients with IBS. Prevalence rates, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SIBO in patients with IBS and controls were calculated.
RESULTS: We included 25 studies with 3,192 patients with IBS and 3,320 controls. SIBO prevalence in patients with IBS was significantly increased compared with controls (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 2.3-6.0). In studies using only healthy controls, the OR for SIBO in patients with IBS was 4.9 (95% CI 2.8-8.6). With breath testing, SIBO prevalence in patients with IBS was 35.5% (95% CI 33.6-37.4) vs 29.7% (95% CI 27.6-31.8) in controls. Culture-based studies yielded a SIBO prevalence of 13.9% (95% CI 11.5-16.4) in patients with IBS and 5.0% (95% CI 3.9-6.2) in controls with a cutoff value of 10 colony-forming units per milliliter vs 33.5% (95% CI 30.1-36.9) in patients with IBS and 8.2% (95% CI 6.8-9.6) in controls with a cutoff value of 10 colony-forming unit per milliliter, respectively. SIBO prevalence diagnosed by lactulose breath test is much greater in both patients with IBS (3.6-fold) and controls (7.6-fold) compared with glucose breath test. Similar difference is seen when lactulose breath test is compared with culture methods. OR for SIBO in patients with IBS-diarrhea compared with IBS-constipation was 1.86 (95% CI 1.83-2.8). Methane-positive breath tests were significantly more prevalent in IBS-constipation compared with IBS-diarrhea (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2). In patients with IBS, proton pump inhibitor was not associated with SIBO (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.5, P = 0.55).
DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a link between IBS and SIBO. However, the overall quality of the evidence is low. This is mainly due to substantial ""clinical heterogeneity"" due to lack of uniform selection criteria for cases and controls and limited sensitivity and specificity of the available diagnostic tests.",Shah A; Talley NJ; Jones M; Kendall BJ; Koloski N; Walker MM; Morrison M; Holtmann GJ,2020,The American journal of gastroenterology,115,2,190-201,10.14309/ajg.0000000000000504,"Shah, A., Talley, N.

36497759,The Prevalence of Ocular Extra-Intestinal Manifestations in Adults Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a greater frequency of ocular extra-intestinal manifestations (O-EIMs) than the general population, while Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have inconsistent prevalence, according to previous studies. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of O-EIMs in CD and UC, respectively. We systemically reviewed O-EIMs and IBD across several online databases. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) observational studies examining the association between O-EIMs and IBD, such as cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies; (2) human and adult individuals; and (3) with case and control groups consisting of patients with and without O-EIMs, respectively. Patients under the age of 18 or any study on pediatric IBD will be excluded. The prevalence of uveitis in adults was determined by 21 studies comprising 190,941 individuals with IBD, including 62,874 CD and 128,067 UC. The pooled analysis revealed significantly increased odds of uveitis in patients with CD than with UC (pooled odd ratio (OR) 1.603, 95% confidence interval 1.254-2.049). The subgroup analysis revealed that European populations had significantly higher odds of developing uveitis and episcleritis in patients with CD than UC (pooled OR 1.683 and 2.401, respectively). Although O-EIMs may be the prodrome of IBD, no consistent finding was obtained as a result of the high heterogeneity from the two included studies. This meta-analysis indicates the significantly increased odds of uveitis in adults with CD than those with UC. In subgroup analysis, European with CD seemed to have higher odds of uveitis and episcleritis than those with UC. Nonetheless, the link between O-EIMs and IBD remained unclear.",Li JX; Chiang CC; Chen SN; Lin JM; Tsai YY,2022,International journal of environmental research and public health,19,23,,10.3390/ijerph192315683,"Li, J.

36550400,Prevalence of frailty among patients with inflammatory bowel disease and its association with clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have reported frailty as an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to determine the relationship of frailty and IBD. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of frailty in patients with IBD and the impact of frailty on the clinical prognosis of these patients.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid (Medline), Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from database inception until October 2022. This systematic review included observational studies describing IBD and frailty. We performed meta-analysis for the frailty prevalence in patients with IBD. We analyzed primary outcomes (mortality) and secondary outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, readmission, and IBD-related surgery).
RESULTS: Nine studies with a total of 1,495,695 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The prevalence of frailty was 18% in patients with IBD. The combined effect analysis showed that frail patients with IBD had a higher risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-4.55) than non-frail patients with IBD. The hazard ratio for infections (HR = 1.23, 0.94-1.60), hospitalizations (HR = 1.72, 0.88-3.36), readmission (HR = 1.21, 1.17-1.25) and IBD-related surgery (HR = 0.78, 0.66-0.91) in frail patients with IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that frailty is a significant independent predictor of mortality in patients with IBD. Our work supports the importance of implementing frailty screening upon admission in patients with IBD. More prospective studies are needed to investigate the influence of frailty on patients with IBD and improve the poor prognosis of patients with frailty and IBD.",Huang X; Xiao M; Jiang B; Wang X; Tang X; Xu X; Chen Y; Wang S; Yan S; Wang S; Wang J; Zhang P,2022,BMC gastroenterology,22,1,534,10.1186/s12876-022-02620-3,"Huang, X., Xiao, M., Jiang, B., Wang, X., Tang, X., Xu, X., Chen, Y., Wang, S., Yan, S., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Zhang, P.

32004880,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Endometriosis and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are common conditions among young women of reproductive age. The etiologies to the diseases are uncertain, but multifactorial pathophysiology has been proposed for each of them. Many studies have examined the two conditions separately, but the literature on the associations between endometriosis and IBS is sparse. However, there is an increasing amount of research on how endometriosis patients are likely to also have a diagnosis of IBS. Furthermore, endometriosis shares several features with IBS, such as low-grade inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. This systematic review summarized published original articles in English that have compared associations between endometriosis and IBS. The inclusion criteria for articles in the review were: i) endometriosis was diagnosed by surgical methods, ii) gastrointestinal symptoms were examined in a structured manner and iii) IBS was diagnosed by Rome criteria. From the initial 254 publications identified on PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE, 13 fulfilled the criteria and could finally be included in the summary. The findings from the review showed that women diagnosed with endometriosis seem to have a twofold or threefold risk to also fulfill the criteria for IBS. The summary risk estimate of the four studies included in the meta-analysis was 2.39 (95 % confidence interval: 1.83-3.11). In women initially diagnosed with IBS, some studies reported a threefold risk of having an endometriosis diagnosis. Despite the strong associations reported between the two conditions, this review also revealed a gap in adjusting for factors that may have affected the expression of gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., phases of the menstrual cycle, medication and psychological aspects, which may have interpretation of the reviewed articles' results. The conclusion of this review is that there is a coexistence of gastrointestinal symptoms fulfilling the Rome criteria in patients with endometriosis, but it is uncertain whether there is a true comorbidity between endometriosis and IBS, or whether the gastrointestinal symptomatology in endometriosis depends on medication. Additionally, the adequacy of the Rome criteria to differentiate IBS from the shared symptomatology of other diseases with visceral hypersensitivity must be further evaluated.",Saidi K; Sharma S; Ohlsson B,2020,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",246,,99-105,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.01.031,"Saidi, K., Sharma, S., & Ohlsson, B.

In order to identify the role of altered intestinal tryptophan metabolism in IBD pathogenesis, a meta-analysis of the transcriptome was performed to identify differentially expressed genes involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathways in intestinal biopsies of IBD as compared to non-IBD controls. Moreover, a systematic review of the metabolome was performed to identify the concurrent changes in tryptophan metabolites. Integration of the transcriptome and metabolome identified various alterations in intestinal tryptophan metabolism during active disease in IBD patients, including decreased intestinal tryptophan absorption, enhanced kynurenine pathway, increased interstitial serotonin availability, changed indole pathway, and activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling. Therefore, a network of intestinal tryptophan metabolism pathways in IBD could be established, helping to assess the potential of genes and metabolites involved in these pathways as diagnostic markers and targets for IBD management.",Wang S; van Schooten FJ; Jin H; Jonkers D; Godschalk R,2023,Nutrients,15,13,,10.3390/nu15132886,"Wang, S., van Schooten, F.

32877572,Safety of bariatric surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The efficacy of bariatric surgery in achieving weight loss and preventing long-term comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis is well established. Data regarding safety of bariatric surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is scarce. We attempted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the complications following bariatric surgery in patients with IBD. The primary outcomes evaluated were wound infection, Clavien-Dindo grade > II complications and IBD exacerbation (within 1 year). Secondary outcomes evaluated included overall mortality, stricture, small bowel obstruction, acute kidney injury (AKI) and thromboembolism. Pooled outcomes (event rate) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects model. A total of 14 studies (all observational) with 2608 patients were included. The rates of primary outcomes were: wound infection (4.1%, 95% CI: 0.9-7.2), Clavien-Dindo grade > II complications (2.0%, 95%: CI 0.6-3.5) and IBD exacerbation (4.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-7.9). The pooled rate for other outcomes was: mortality 0.1%, stricture 6.5%, small bowel obstruction 6.7%, AKI 2.2% and thromboembolism 0.1%.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Google Scholar and performed a meta-analysis of 13 studies to analyze how variables such as sample type (stool, biopsy, and lavage) affect results in inflammatory bowel disease gut microbiome studies, using uniform bioinformatic methods for all primary data.
RESULTS: Reduced alpha diversity was a consistent feature of both CD and ulcerative colitis but was more pronounced in CD. Disease contributed significantly variation in beta diversity in most studies, but effect size varied, and the effect of sample type was greater than the effect of disease. Fusobacterium was the genus most consistently associated with CD, but disease-associated genera were mostly inconsistent between studies. Stool studies had lower heterogeneity than biopsy studies, especially for CD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sample type variation is an important contributor to study variability that should be carefully considered during study design, and stool is likely superior to biopsy for CD studies due to its lower heterogeneity.",Abdel-Rahman LIH; Morgan XC,2023,Inflammatory bowel diseases,29,1,125-139,10.1093/ibd/izac194,"Abdel-Rahman, L.

39968993,DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SMALL INTESTINAL BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH: AN OFFICIAL POSITION PAPER FROM THE BRAZILIAN FEDERATION OF GASTROENTEROLOGY.,"BACKGROUND: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in bacterial population in the small intestine, leading to symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea, and eventually malabsorption. The diagnosis and management of SIBO remain challenging due to overlapping symptoms with other gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and coeliac disease.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to review current evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of SIBO, with a focus on strategies suitable for the Brazilian healthcare system.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed, focusing on clinical guidelines, randomized controlled trials, and cohort studies concerning SIBO. Diagnostic methods, including breath tests and direct aspiration techniques, were critically analyzed. Treatment approaches, including antibiotics, dietary modifications, and probiotics, were reviewed. The recommendations were formulated based on a panel of gastroenterologists, members of the Brazilian Federation of Gastroenterology (FBG), with approval from the majority of the members.
RESULTS: Breath tests using glucose and lactulose remain the most commonly used non-invasive diagnostic tools, though they are subject to limitations such as false positives and false negatives. Treatment with rifaximin is effective in most cases of SIBO, while systemic antibiotics like metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are alternatives. Probiotics and dietary interventions, particularly low FODMAP diets, can complement antibiotic therapy. Long-term follow-up is essential due to the recurrence rate, which is common in SIBO patients.
CONCLUSION: Standardizing SIBO diagnosis and treatment in Brazil is essential to reduce diagnostic delays and optimize care, especially given the disparities and heterogeneity in clinical practice across the country. This article provides evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice. Further research is needed to refine diagnostic methods, explore novel treatment strategies, and better understand the specific characteristics of the Brazilian population.",Silva BCD; Ramos GP; Barros LL; Ramos AFP; Domingues G; Chinzon D; Passos MDCF,2025,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,62,,e24107,10.1590/S0004-2803.24612024-107,"Silva, B.

The aim of this review is to summarise the evidence-base in this regard. Observational evidence does not give a clear indication that PP intake has a preventative role for IBD or IBS, while interventional studies suggest these compounds may confer symptomatic and health-related quality of life improvements in known patients. There are inconsistent results for effects on markers of inflammation, but there are promising reports of endoscopic improvement.

38261245,Post-infection irritable bowel syndrome following Coronavirus disease-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are increasingly being recognized after Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Though quite a few studies addressed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following COVID-19, the disorders' prevalence varies greatly. We evaluated, (i) overall frequency of post-COVID-19 IBS, (ii) relative risk of development of IBS among COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls using systematic review and meta-analysis techniques.
METHODS: Literature search was performed for studies on GI symptoms and FGIDs after COVID-19 using electronic databases (Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar and Web of Science) till April 28, 2023. We included studies reporting IBS after COVID-19 with any duration of follow-up and any number of subjects. Studies on pediatric population and those not providing relevant information were excluded. Relative risk of development of IBS using Rome criteria among COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls was calculated. Analysis was done using MedCalc (Applied Math, Mariakerke, Belgium, version 7.2) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.3.070 (Biostat Inc. Englewood, NJ 07631, USA).
RESULTS: Of the available studies, 13 (four case-control) reporting on IBS after COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. Among 3950 COVID-19 patients and 991 controls, 7.2% of COVID-19 patients and 4.9% of healthy controls developed IBS. Of the four case-control studies reporting post-COVID-19 IBS, patients with COVID-19 were 2.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.538 to 13.039) times more likely to have post-COVID-19 IBS as compared to healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop post-COVID-19 IBS than healthy controls. The heterogeneity of studies, different criteria used by various studies to diagnose post-COVID-19 IBS and some studies not meeting the six-month follow-up duration of the Rome criteria for diagnosing IBS are limitations of this systematic review.",Mathur A; Shams U; Mishra P; Sahu S; Goenka MK; Ghoshal U; Ghoshal UC,2024,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,43,3,557-566,10.1007/s12664-023-01486-x,"Mathur, A., Shams, U., Mishra, P., Sahu, S., Goenka, M.

METHODS: PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to 9 January 2023. Platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values from active and remission inflammatory bowel disease cases were compared to generate a mean difference (MD).
RESULTS: Nine studies were included. Meta-analysis showed that inflammatory bowel disease patients with active disease had significantly higher values of platelet-lymphocyte ratio as compared to those in remission (MD: 63.46 95% CI: 35.74, 91.17, I2 = 89%). The values of platelet-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in both active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Meta-analysis also showed that lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values were significantly lower in active inflammatory bowel disease patients as compared to those under remission (MD: -1.28 95% CI: -1.42, -1.14, I2 = 4%). Lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values were significantly lower in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients with active disease.
CONCLUSION: Platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio can be useful blood-based markers in differentiating active disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Active cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have high platelet-lymphocyte ratio and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio as compared to those in remission.

Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether 5-aminosalicylates or thiopurines can protect against the progression of LGD in patients with IBD.
METHODS: Systematic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and major conference proceedings were conducted to identify all eligible studies through March 2020. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Five studies comprising 776 IBD patients with LGD were included. Overall, 5-aminosalicylates (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.51) and thiopurines (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.23-1.79) did not significantly reduce the risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia/cancer) in IBD patients with LGD. Moreover, the effects of 5-aminosalicylates or thiopurines on risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia in IBD patients with LGD were not significant by different primary sclerosing cholangitis status, study quality, sample size, and IBD type.

Risk for IBD-related complications (OR=1.12, I2 98% p = 0.77), mortality (OR=1.52, I2 98% p = 0.37) and IBD-related surgery (OR=1.20, I2 81% p = 0.26) did not differ. Risk of IBD-related hospitalizations (OR=2.52, I2 0% p < 0.00001) and sepsis (OR=1.56, I2 88% p = 0.0003) was higher in the IBD+DM group. Risk of pneumonia and urinary tract infections was higher in the IBD+DM group (OR=1.72 and OR=1.93), while risk of C. Difficile infection did not differ (OR=1.22 I2 88% p = 0.37). Mean Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score was lower in the IBD+DM group (38.9 vs. 47, p = 0.03). Mean health care costs per year were $10,598.2 vs $3747.3 (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: DM might negatively affect the course of IBD by increasing the risk of hospitalization and infections, but not IBD-related complications and mortality.",Fuschillo G; Celentano V; Rottoli M; Sciaudone G; Gravina AG; Pellegrino R; Marfella R; Romano M; Selvaggi F; Pellino G,2023,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,55,5,580-586,10.1016/j.dld.2022.08.017,"Fuschillo, G., Celentano, V., Rottoli, M., Sciaudone, G., Gravina, A.

35920906,Colorectal cancer risk of flat low-grade dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To date, the optimal management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and flat low-grade dysplasia (fLGD) of the colon or rectum remains controversial.
METHODS: A systematic review was reported in accordance with PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Patients diagnosed with fLGD on surveillance endoscopy were pooled from studies published between 2000 and 2020. Advanced neoplasia was defined by the presence of HGD, CRC or small bowel adenocarcinoma detected on subsequent surveillance endoscopy or from examination of resection specimens. We estimated the pooled annual incidence rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced neoplasia, and the risk factors associated with neoplastic progression.
RESULTS: We identified 24 articles and 738 IBD patients were diagnosed with fLGD on endoscopy. Two hundred thirty-six patients (32%) underwent immediate surgery with surgical specimens demonstrating CRC in 8 patients (pooled prevalence, 8.66%; 95% CI 3.58-19.46) and HGD (high grade dysplasia) in 11 patients (pooled prevalence, 13.97%; 95% CI 5.65-30.65). Five hundred-two patients (68%) underwent endoscopic surveillance with 63 patients with fLGD progressing to advanced neoplasia during endoscopic surveillance (38 HGD, 24 CRC and one patient developing small bowel adenocarcinoma). The mean duration of follow-up after fLGD diagnosis was 71 months (10.9-212). The pooled incidence of CRC and advanced neoplasia was 0.5 (95% CI 0.23-0.77) and 1.71 per 100 patient-year (95% CI 0.88-2.54) respectively. The use of corticosteroids and location of fLGD in the distal colon were significantly associated with neoplastic progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a summary incidence rate of CRC and advanced neoplasia in patients with IBD and fLGD to inform surgeons' and endoscopists' decision-making thus reducing potential ineffective treatments.",Lauricella S; Fabris S; Sylla P,2023,Surgical endoscopy,37,1,48-61,10.1007/s00464-022-09462-w,"Lauricella, S., Fabris, S., & Sylla, P.

34405817,Risk Factors for Vitamin D Deficiency in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To identify risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in inflammatory bowel disease and conduct a comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis to quantify the impact on vitamin D deficiency.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search of studies through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. In addition, relevant articles were searched manually. Studies were included if the odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI of each risk factor were reported or could be calculated. We will use the fixed-effects or random-effects model to estimate the pooled effect.
RESULTS: Out of 1018 articles, 25 eligible studies were identified, including 5826 participants. The risk factors associated with hypovitaminosis D were non-Caucasian (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.68-5.34), Crohn's disease (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.21-1.56), disease activity (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.61-2.13), inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.38-1.89), exposure to steroid (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28-2.03), and biologics (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.48-2.14). In 30 ng/mL and adjusted OR subgroup, male (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.47-2.31) and winter season (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.69-3.67) also were risk factors, respectively. 5-aminosalicylic acid (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.74-1.63) and smoking (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.98-1.45) were unrelated to vitamin D deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: For vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease, non-Caucasian, Crohn's disease, disease activity, surgery, exposure to steroid and biologics, males are risk factors, while 5-aminosalicylic acid and smoking are not. The relationship between body mass index, winter season, exposure to immunomodulators, and vitamin D deficiency remains unclear.",Shi S; Feng J; Zhou L; Li Y; Shi H,2021,The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,32,6,508-518,10.5152/tjg.2021.20614,"Shi, S., Feng, J., Zhou, L., Li, Y., & Shi, H.

38272759,Do interventions for mood improve inflammatory biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease?: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms and the gut-brain axis appear relevant to disease activity and progression in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). A recent review showed no effect of psychological therapies on self-reported disease activity in IBD. This meta-analysis aims to establish whether interventions targeting mood outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety and stress) impact inflammation levels in IBD and possible moderators of these effects.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. We searched five electronic databases and included randomised controlled trials where interventions targeted mood and assessed inflammatory outcomes pre- and post-intervention in adults with IBD. Independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Data were pooled to estimate standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). A random-effects robust variance estimation accounted for studies measuring multiple biomarkers. Intervention type, mood as a primary or secondary outcome, effect on mood outcomes and IBD subtype were investigated as treatment effect moderators. Where there were sufficient biomarkers, individual meta-analyses were run (Pre-registration PROSPERO: CRD42023389401).
FINDINGS: 28 RCTs involving 1789 participants met inclusion criteria. Interventions demonstrated small, statistically significant effects on biomarkers (-0.35, 95% CI: -0.48, -0.22, p < 0.001) and medium effects on mood outcomes (-0.50, 95% CI: -0.73, -0.27, p < 0.001), without evidence of substantive heterogeneity or publication bias. Individual analyses showed small effects for improved faecal calprotectin (-0.19, 95% CI: -0.34, -0.03, p = 0.018) and C-Reactive Protein (-0.29, 95% CI: -0.47, -0.10, p = 0.002). Effect sizes were larger for psychological therapy interventions (compared with exercise or antidepressants) and when there was an effect (SMD ≥0.2) on mood.
INTERPRETATION: Treatments which address mood outcomes have beneficial effects on generic inflammation as well as disease-specific biomarkers (faecal calprotectin and C-Reactive Protein). Psychological interventions and interventions with larger treatment effects on mood accentuated the effect on biomarkers. More research is required to understand the biological or behavioural mechanisms underlying this effect.

36322453,Role of Pharmacogenomics in the Efficacy and Safety of Thiopurines in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Thiopurines' toxicity often leads to dose reduction or discontinuation. This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence on the effect of genotype-based dosing of thiopurines on treatment efficacy and safety in inflammatory bowel disease (objective #1), and the association between genotype status and the efficacy and safety profile (objective #2).
METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched in August 2021. A total of 80 studies (19,859 individuals) were included. Meta-analyses for mortality, different types of adverse events (AEs), withdrawal due to AE, change in disease activity and clinical remission were performed following mainly a fixed-effects model. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020148130.
RESULTS: Genotype-based dosing was associated to a significantly lower incidence of hematologic AEs (risk ratio=0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.90; I2 : 47%; 4 randomized controlled trials; moderate quality), which may be attributable to nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) testing more than to thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping. No differences were found in other outcomes. Mutations in TPMT and NUDT15 genes were associated to a higher probability of serious AEs [odds ratio (OR) TPMT=4.98; OR NUDT15=11.44], hematologic AEs (OR TPMT=3.18), and serious hematologic AEs (OR TPMT=7.88; OR NUDT15=12.83). TPMT was also associated with a higher risk of withdrawals due to AEs (OR=3.38), and NUDT15 with gastrointestinal AEs (OR=2.04). Mutations in the ITPA gene did not lead to significant differences. Evidence of an association between other genes and clinical outcomes is still scarce.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in TPMT and NUDT15 genes predispose patients to suffer thiopurine-induced toxicity, and genotype-guided treatment has been shown to contribute to the prevention of thiopurine-induced toxicity, especially in the case of NUDT15 in Asians.",Gutiérrez-Valencia M; Leache L; Saiz LC; Beloqui JJ; Barajas M; Vicuña M; Erviti J,2023,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,57,7,671-685,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001791,"Gutiérrez-Valencia, M., Leache, L., Saiz, L.

36997007,Assessment of anti-inflammatory efficacy of acupuncture in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation has a significant role in the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Increasing attention has been paid to the use of acupuncture in IBD patients; however, its regulatory effects on inflammatory factors in IBD still require validation. Here, we systematically evaluated the effects of acupuncture on inflammatory factors in IBD patients.
METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria. After evaluating the quality of the studies selected by two reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in IBD patients and the impact on inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-8 and IL-10).
RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials with a total of 228 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on IBD (MD = 1.22, 95% CI [1.07, 1.39], P = 0.003). Moreover, it regulates the levels of TNF-α (MD =-60.58, 95% CI [-100.30, -20.89], P = 0.003), IL-8 (MD =-56.40, 95% CI [-60.02, -52.14], P < 0.00001) and IL-10 (MD =35.96, 95% CI [11.02, 60.91], P = 0.005) in IBD patients. However, the P value of meta-analysis in IL-1 great than 0.05.(MD =-27.90, 95% CI [-97.82, 42.02], P = 0.11).
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on IBD and can effectively regulate inflammatory factors in IBD patients. TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-10 are more appropriate inflammatory indicators for clinically evaluating the anti-inflammatory response in the blood of IBD patients by acupuncture.",Yang X; He M; Tang Q; Wang Z; Jin D; Wu X; Yang Y; Ma D; Sun M; Li T,2023,Complementary therapies in medicine,74,,102946,10.1016/j.ctim.2023.102946,"Yang, X., He, M., Tang, Q., Wang, Z., Jin, D., Wu, X., Yang, Y., Ma, D., Sun, M., & Li, T.

35775920,Psychiatric Disorders in Adult and Paediatric Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], which are associated with a high disease burden, are also reported to be accompanied by a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. However, the literature on IBD and psychiatric disorders has not been reviewed.
METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines, and its protocol was registered at PROSPERO [ID: CRD42020214359]. PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO were consulted for the literature search. Studies reporting on diagnosed psychiatric disorders in IBD were included. Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [NOS].
RESULTS: Sixty-nine studies were identified with an average cohort size of 60 114 patients. Pooled prevalence rates were: mood disorders, 10% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7%; 15%); anxiety disorders, 12% [95% CI = 8%; 18%]; substance misuse, 3% [95% CI = 1%; 7%]; psychotic disorders, 2% [95% CI = 1%; 4%]; behavioural disorders, 1% [95% CI = 0%; 3%]; personality disorders, 3% [95% CI = 1%; 10%]; developmental disorders, 1% [95% CI = 0%; 3%]; and behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually during childhood, 1% [95% CI = 1%; 3%]. All analyses had high statistical heterogeneity [I2 > 99%]. Seven studies reported an increased risk of suicide in IBD patients compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities was high [11-82%] in patients with IBD and was higher than in the background population.

37208218,Microbial composition across body sites in polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women, but the cause remains unclear. Recent evidence has linked microbial composition with PCOS; however, the results are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to gather current knowledge of the microbes across body sites (oral cavity, blood, vagina/cervix, gut) in women with PCOS, and meta-analyse the microbial diversity in PCOS. For this purpose, a systematic search using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus was carried out. After selection, 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies associated changes in the microbiome with PCOS, whereas heterogeneity of the studies in terms of ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and methodology, among other confounders, made it difficult to corroborate this relationship. In fact, 19 out of 34 of the studies were categorised as having high risk of bias when the quality assessment was conducted. Our meta-analysis on the gut microbiome of 14 studies demonstrated that women with PCOS possess significantly lower microbial alpha diversity compared with controls (SMD = -0.204; 95% CI -0.360 to -0.048; P = 0.010; I2 = 5.508, by Shannon Index), which may contribute to the development of PCOS.

32330874,Volatomics in inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by the human metabolism, inflammation and gut microbiota and form the basis of innovative volatomics research. VOCs detected through breath and faecal analysis hence serve as attractive, non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review describes the clinical applicability of volatomics in discriminating between IBS, IBD and healthy volunteers with acceptable accuracy in breath (70%-100%) and faecal (58%-85%) samples. Promising compounds are propan-1-ol for diagnosing and monitoring of IBD patients, and 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohexa-1,4-diene as biomarker for IBS diagnosis. However, these VOCs often seem to be related to inflammation and probably will need to be used in conjunction with other clinical evidence. Furthermore, three interventional studies underlined the potential of VOCs in predicting treatment outcome and patient follow-up. This shows great promise for future use of VOCs as non-invasive breath and faecal biomarkers in personalised medicine. However, properly designed studies that correlate VOCs to IBD/IBS pathogenesis, while taking microbial influences into account, are still key before clinical implementation can be expected.",Van Malderen K; De Winter BY; De Man JG; De Schepper HU; Lamote K,2020,EBioMedicine,54,,102725,10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102725,"Van Malderen, K., De Winter, B.

38006941,Indigo naturalis (Qing dai) for inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Indigo naturalis (Qing dai) is a traditional therapy reported to be useful in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially for ulcerative colitis. We performed a systematic review of its efficacy and safety in IBD.
METHODS: Electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus) were searched on 4th March 2023 to identify reports about the use of indigo naturalis in IBD. We extracted data with respect to clinical response, remission, endoscopic and histological responses, and adverse events with the use of indigo naturalis in IBD. Pooled clinical response rates and remission rates were calculated. The quality of studies was assessed using Joanna-Briggs tools.
RESULTS: Nine studies reporting on 299 patients were included. The pooled clinical response rate was 0.796 (95 %CI, 0.7465-0.8379, I2=0), and the clinical remission rate in ulcerative colitis was 0.668 (0.488- 0.809, I2=85.2 %). The pooled relative risk of clinical response was higher in the indigo naturalis group as compared to placebo in the two randomized trials [3.82 (2.04; 7.14, I2=0)]. Except for one reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension case, most reported adverse effects were mild. The endoscopic and histological responses, when reported, suggested that indigo naturalis is effective for ulcerative colitis. The limitations of the systematic review included a small number of randomized studies, reports only from East Asia and a relatively small number of patients, especially for Crohn's disease.

39576289,Randomized controlled trials of the effects of capsaicin or menthol on irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common intestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, abdominal distension and irregular defecation frequency, and it has had a high incidence and low cure rate in recent years. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is one of the main physiological indicators of IBS, and TRPV1 and TRPM8 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and melastatin 8) play crucial roles in VH and are widely distributed in the intestine, significantly impacting abdominal pain in IBS patients. Under the guidance of PRISMA, four databases were systematically searched at the outset, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting specific abdominal pain scores (rather than the incidence rate) in IBS patients receiving capsaicin or menthol (agonist of TRPV1 and TRPM8) interventions were included. A meta-analysis was conducted on the retrieved studies, which consisted of three articles on capsaicin and five articles on menthol, to compare the efficacy of capsaicin and menthol in alleviating abdominal pain in IBS patients under conditions of low heterogeneity. The results demonstrated that menthol had a significant effect in relieving abdominal pain in IBS patients. Conversely, although the effect of capsaicin was not statistically significant, two studies involving long-term capsaicin intervention suggested its potential to reduce VH and subsequently relieve abdominal pain, which may be attributed to the up-regulation of the TRPV1 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract of individuals with IBS.",Fang Q; Yu L; Tian F; Chen W; Zhai Q; Zhang H,2024,Food & function,15,24,11865-11874,10.1039/d4fo04268a,"Fang, Q., Yu, L., Tian, F., Chen, W., Zhai, Q., & Zhang, H.

35101341,Vaccination coverage among migrants: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Migrants, a population vulnerable to communicable diseases, face multiple barriers in access to immunization programs. Individual studies suggest that they suffer immunization inequity compared to non-migrants, but the gap in vaccination has not been quantified. This systematic review assessed quantitatively the level of vaccination coverage among migrants, in comparison with non-migrants, collating the published literature.
METHODS: Review protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42021228061). A literature search without language restrictions was conducted in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from database inception to February 2021. This review included observational studies that provided the vaccination rates among migrant and non-migrant groups. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Data were synthesized pooling data from individual studies to generate summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using random effects model, assessing heterogeneity with I2 statistic and publication bias with funnel asymmetry analysis.
FINDINGS: There were 44 relevant studies (7,937,996 participants). Overall risk of bias was low in 13 (30%), moderate in 22 (50%) and high in 9 (20%) studies. Point estimates of individual ORs showed lower vaccination coverage among migrants in 36 of 39 meta-analyzable studies. Overall, the odds of vaccination coverage among migrants were lower compared to non-migrants (7,375,184 participants; summary OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.37-0.66; I2 99.9%). There was no funnel asymmetry.

32552882,The risk of rheumatoid arthritis among patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the available data on this association are inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between IBD and the risk of RA.
METHODS: Observational studies investigating the RA risk among patients with IBD (Crohn disease (CD) and/or ulcerative colitis (UC)) were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from the date of inception to December 2019. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CIs) were pooled with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics while publication bias was determined using Begg's and Egger's tests. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: A total of three cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two case-control studies were included in the meta-analyses. Compared to the non-IBD control or general population, there was a significantly higher risk of RA among patients with IBD (RR = 2.59; 95% CI: 1.93-3.48). Moreover, both CD (RR = 3.14; 95% CI: 2.46-4.01) and UC (RR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.76-2.97) were associated with a significantly increased risk of RA. However, heterogeneity was substantial across studies and the subgroup analyses failed to identify the potential source of heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD have a greater risk of developing RA. Rheumatologists should be consulted when patients with IBD present with undifferentiated joint complaints. However, more prospective cohort studies are needed to validate these results.",Chen Y; Chen L; Xing C; Deng G; Zeng F; Xie T; Gu L; Yang H,2020,BMC gastroenterology,20,1,192,10.1186/s12876-020-01339-3,"Chen, Y., Chen, L., Xing, C., Deng, G., Zeng, F., Xie, T., Gu, L., & Yang, H.

35596263,Prevalence and clinical features of patients with autoimmune pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are categorized into immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs). While AIP is a pancreato-biliary IMID with an increased incidence and prevalence among patients with IBD, its features are still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of AIP-IBD patients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify observational studies assessing AIP and IBD. The primary outcome was the prevalence of IBD among AIP patients, and vice versa. Secondary outcomes included clinical findings and outcomes of each IMID in AIP-IBD patients. The pooled rate of each outcome was determined using a random effects model.
RESULTS: For primary outcomes, 40 observational studies with 4031 AIP patients were included and the pooled prevalence of IBD was 10.5% (95% CI 7.2-15.0%). Meanwhile, five studies with 10,551 IBD patients were included and the pooled prevalence of AIP was 0.6% (95% CI 0.2-1.9%). For secondary outcomes, 53 observational studies with 469 AIP-IBD patients were assessed. The rates of type 2 AIP and ulcerative colitis were 79.2% (95% CI 69.1-86.6%) and 74.8% (95% CI 68.2-80.4%), respectively. We also demonstrated AIP-IBD patients were at a significant increased risk of AIP recurrence and colectomy compared with patients with either AIP or IBD (RR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1 and P = 0.014 and RR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.9-6.9, P < 0.001, respectively).

40114011,Meta-Analysis: Pregnancies With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Complicated by Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) requires maintenance of remission during pregnancy to avoid poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) could also increase these risks.
AIMS: To examine the prevalence of ICP in pregnancies with IBD and associations with thiopurine exposure.
METHODS: An electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic databases using search terms for IBD and ICP from inception to 10th September 2024 was performed. Studies involving pregnant adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD reporting ICP were included. Prevalence and event numbers for ICP were pooled using a random effects model.
RESULTS: We identified two case reports, a case series of eight cases, and three cohort studies. Pooled prevalence of ICP in 1603 pregnancies with IBD was 3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0%-7.0%). One cohort study reported that the prevalence of ICP in IBD was significantly higher compared to the general population (odds ratio [OR] 3.08 [95% CI 1.11-8.56], p = 0.039). Meta-analysis showed that thiopurine exposure was associated with an increased risk of ICP, OR 6.65 [95% CI 3.10-14.25]. One cohort study showed that, compared to non-IBD controls, the incidence of ICP was increased in thiopurine exposed pregnancies (OR 7.55 [95% CI 2.52-22.57] p < 0.001) but not in non-exposed pregnancies (OR 1.41 [95% CI 0.40-4.92], p = 0.75).

32578179,Safety and Efficacy of Bariatric Surgery in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis studying safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in IBD patients as well as the impact of bariatric surgery on IBD course.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases (through September 2019) to identify studies that reported outcome of bariatric surgery in IBD patients. Outcomes assessed included the pooled rate of adverse events, change in medications after bariatric surgery, and 12-month excess weight loss (EWL) and body mass index (BMI) reduction after bariatric surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included in final analysis. The pooled rate of early and late adverse events was 15.9% (95% CI, 9.3-25.9) and 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-23.1), respectively. The rate of adverse events in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was 45.6% (95% CI, 21.9-71.4) compared with 21.6% (95% CI, 11.1-38) in sleeve gastrectomy (p = 0.11). The pooled rate of 12-month EWL and BMI reduction after surgery was 66.1% (95% CI, 59.8-72.3%) and 13.7 kg/m2 (95% CI, 12.5-14.9), respectively. The pooled rate of decrease, increase, and no change of IBD medications were 45.6% (95% CI, 23.8-69.2), 11% (95% CI, 6.3-18.4), and 57.6% (95% CI, 39.2-74.1), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery has acceptable safety and efficacy profile in IBD patients.

34216824,Prevalence and Risk Factors for Fatigue in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disease with high morbidity, substantial health care costs, and increasing incidence. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms that impacts quality of life and is a leading concern for patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to determine the global prevalence, risk factors, and impact of fatigue in adults with IBD.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Data were retrieved from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from database inception to October 2019. A pooled prevalence of fatigue was calculated using a random-effects model. Stratified meta-analyses explored sources of between-study heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed using an adapted checklist from Downs and Black.
RESULTS: The search yielded 4524 studies, of which 20 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Overall, the studies were of good quality. The pooled prevalence of fatigue was 47% (95% confidence interval, 41%-54%), though between-study heterogeneity was high (I2 = 98%). Fatigue prevalence varied significantly by the definition of fatigue (chronic: 28%; high: 48%; P < .01) and disease status (active disease: 72%; remission: 47%; P < .01). Sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and anemia were the most commonly reported fatigue-related risk factors.

38597690,Physical Activity is Associated with a Decreased Risk of Developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Modifiable risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], such as physical activity, may be used as prevention strategies. However, the findings of previous studies on the association between physical activity and IBD risk have been inconsistent. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of physical activity on IBD risk.
METHODS: A search was conducted for relevant studies published before April 2023 that assessed the effect of pre-IBD diagnosis levels of physical activity on IBD incidence. Individual summary statistics [relative risks; RR], and confidence intervals [CI] were extracted with forest plots generated. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] approach to assess the quality of evidence.
RESULTS: Ten observational studies were included. For cohort studies, there were 1182 Crohn's disease [CD] and 2361 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients, with 860 992 participants without IBD. For case-control studies, there were 781 CD to 2636 controls, and 1127 UC to 3752 controls. Compared with individuals with low physical activity levels, the RRs of CD in individuals with high physical activity levels for cohort and case-control studies were 0.78 [95% CI 0.68-0.88, p = 0.0001] and 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.95, p = 0.003], respectively. For UC, the RRs were 0.62 [95% CI 0.43-0.88, p = 0.008] and 0.74 [95% CI 0.51-1.07, p = 0.11].

We extracted and pooled the (adjusted) odds ratio (OR) and (adjusted) risk ratio (RR).Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 11 studies. The pooled OR of all 11 studies was 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.85). The pooled ORs of the subsequent Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis after antibiotic use in childhood were 1.59 (95% CI: 1.06-2.4) and 1.22 (95% CI: 0.82-1.8). The sensitivity analysis showed no change. The meta-regression showed there was not statistical significance for the publication year, research area and research methods. Egger's test showed publication bias in the IBD studies (p = .006 < .05) but no publication bias for the CD (p = .275>.05) and UC studies (p = .537>.05).Conclusions: There was a positive association between antibiotic use in childhood and the subsequently risk of Crohn's disease in non-European countries in the west during 2010-2013. Children in the United States taking antibiotics will have a higher risk of subsequently IBD than Europe, Asia and Australia.

40229330,The impact of inflammatory bowel disease on dementia risk: a current systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Emerging evidence indicates that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and dementia may share underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors. However, the association between a prior IBD diagnosis and the subsequent risk of dementia remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to February 4, 2025, without language restrictions. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated methodological quality and risk of bias. Observational studies comparing dementia risk in IBD and non-IBD populations were included. Pooled effect estimates for odds ratios (OR) were calculated using random-effects models. A total of 10 population-based studies, involving 7,895,339 participants (269,387 with IBD), were included. Meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant association between IBD and dementia risk (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.27, P = 0.0001). However, IBD was not associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.98-1.36, P = 0.09). Stratified analysis by IBD type revealed a positive association between both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and dementia risk (UC: OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.25, P = 0.002, I2 = 81%; CD: OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11-1.43, P = 0.0003, I2 = 53%). This study identifies a significant correlation between IBD and dementia, suggesting that IBD patients have an elevated risk of developing dementia.

33346998,Alterations in Heart Rate Variability Associated With Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are gastrointestinal pathologies affecting large numbers of the global population and incurring significant healthcare costs. Disruptions in the gut-brain axis occurring in these conditions can lead to increased inflammation, affecting gastrointestinal and autonomic nervous system function. Heart rate variability (HRV) is commonly used to assess the state of the sympathetic and parasympathetic function of the autonomic nervous system, but it remains unclear how HRV measures are associated with gastrointestinal pathologies. Here, we conduct a systematic review of the literature comparing HRV of subjects diagnosed with IBS or IBD to HRV in healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL (EBSCO) for eligible studies up to 2018. We included any study comparing a recognized measure of HRV between a group of patients with either IBS or IBD to a group of matched HC before any intervention. Studies were screened, and data were extracted from included articles using predefined criteria. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for each outcome, with effect size reported as the standardized mean difference.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between IBD and HC in time domain HRV and significant decreases in high-frequency power measures were also noted, in both IBS and IBD compared with HC.
DISCUSSION: Parasympathetic nervous system activity, represented through high-frequency power, seems to be lower in people with IBS and IBD, but conclusions are limited by the small number of studies that provide usable data, methodological heterogeneity, and high risks of bias in primary study methods and measures.",Sadowski A; Dunlap C; Lacombe A; Hanes D,2020,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,12,1,e00275,10.14309/ctg.0000000000000275,"Sadowski, A., Dunlap, C., Lacombe, A., & Hanes, D.

35581170,Association between irritable bowel syndrome and micronutrients: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of gut brain interaction with a multifactorial etiology. Food trigger avoidance is common among individuals with IBS and exclusion diets are gaining popularity. However, recent guidelines on IBS management cautioned regarding the use of unsupervised dietary therapy with concerns of development of poor eating habits and even nutritional deficiencies. We aimed to review the available literature on the effect of habitual and exclusion diets on micronutrient status as well as the role of micronutrient supplementation in alleviating IBS symptoms.
METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science) were searched for articles that reported micronutrient data in patients with IBS. Serum micronutrient levels and dietary intake of micronutrients in patients with IBS were collected. The extracted data were tabulated and organized by micronutrient type to observe for trends.
RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were included in this systematic review (12 interventional and 14 observational studies). Studies showed that generally IBS subjects had lower levels of vitamin B2, vitamin D, calcium, and iron at baseline compared with non-IBS subjects. Studies also found that exclusion diets were associated with lower intake of micronutrients especially vitamin B1, B2, calcium, iron, and zinc. There was a lack of interventional studies on micronutrients.
CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel syndrome patients are at risk of developing multiple micronutrient deficiencies that may have both localized gastrointestinal as well as systemic effects. Dietary management of IBS patients should include a proper dietitian review to ensure nutritional adequacy where possible.",Bek S; Teo YN; Tan XH; Fan KHR; Siah KTH,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,8,1485-1497,10.1111/jgh.15891,"Bek, S., Teo, Y.

36579768,Effectiveness of Vitamin D Supplementation on Disease Course in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The vitamin D role in bone metabolism is well known; however, recent evidence suggests the impact of vitamin D in immune modulation and its implications in immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHOD: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis by a specific protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42022311184; March 2022, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=311184). Randomized clinical trials involving IBD patients treated with vitamin D supplementation, compared with placebo, that evaluated the risk of clinical relapse and disease activity were included. Literature search was performed using Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL through January 2022.
RESULTS: Out of 1448 articles, 12 (11 full-texts and 1 abstract) were included. Seven randomized clinical trials reported data on the clinical relapse as dichotomous outcome, while 7 studies reported data on disease activity expressed as continuous variables. The pooled risk ratio of clinical relapse was 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.89; I2 = 25%) among 458 IBD patients. However, this seems to be solid only in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In fact, only 2 studies, involving 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, were included in the analysis. CD patients in clinical remission had a strong significant risk reduction in clinical relapse (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.82; I2 = 0%), suggesting that it could be a specific subgroup with maximum clinical benefit of vitamin D supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of clinical relapse in IBD patients, especially in CD patients in clinical remission. In a subgroup analysis, it was not significant (due to small number of studies and low number of patients), and well-powered studies are needed, in particular for ulcerative colitis patients.",Valvano M; Magistroni M; Cesaro N; Carlino G; Monaco S; Fabiani S; Vinci A; Vernia F; Viscido A; Latella G,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,2,281-291,10.1093/ibd/izac253,"Valvano, M., Magistroni, M., Cesaro, N., Carlino, G., Monaco, S., Fabiani, S., Vinci, A., Vernia, F., Viscido, A., & Latella, G.

35086857,Meta-analysis and systematic review of the association between adverse childhood events and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by abdominal pain, bowel habits alterations, constipation, and/or diarrhea. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are events such as abuse and mental illness causing childhood trauma. Studies report higher prevalence of ACEs in patients with IBS with varied effect consistency and association strength. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate current literature, assess heterogeneity and research gaps in this relationship. A search across PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar with keywords ('childhood adversity' OR 'childhood trauma' OR 'adverse childhood events') AND ('irritable colon' OR 'irritable bowel syndrome') yielded 106 studies. A restricted maximum likelihood model of 15 chosen studies with 272,686 participants found the association between ACEs and IBS to be uncertain given the considerable heterogeneity (I2=93.58%, p<0.001). Objective reporting methods for ACE and IBS, study size, and study quality explained some heterogeneity. Twelve studies showed publication bias (Egger's test, p<0.001), which further weakened interpretation. Gender-stratified subanalysis of three studies found ACEs associated with IBS in females (pOR=2.20, 95% CI (1.13 to 4.29), I2=66.90%) with substantial heterogeneity, but no association in males (pOR=1.30, 95% CI (0.62 to 2.78)). This meta-analysis explores the current literature to understand the biopsychosocial perspective of IBS and ACEs' role as risk factors.

35396764,Vitamin D supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and complex gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Observational studies have suggested a relationship between serum vitamin D levels and IBS symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation on IBS symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) measures.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by four authors independently, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus from the senior author. Continuous data were pooled with standardized mean difference (SMD) using the DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis by risk of bias and potentially ""predatory"" publication were performed as well.
RESULTS: A total of 685 patients across eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation significantly improved IBS symptom severity scale scores, with a SMD of -0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.47 to -0.07, P = 0.04, I2 = 91%). Improvements in IBS-QoL scores were also observed, albeit not statistically significant (SMD 0.54; 95% CI -0.34 to 1.41, P = 0.15, I2 = 87%). However, small sample sizes, a relatively young study population, limited ethnicities, and varied vitamin D dosing strategies across the studies were notable limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation could be part of our clinical armamentarium when managing IBS patients due to the potential efficacy and good safety profile. Further randomized, controlled trials are required to confirm the therapeutic effects.",Chong RIH; Yaow CYL; Loh CYL; Teoh SE; Masuda Y; Ng WK; Lim YL; Ng QX,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,6,993-1003,10.1111/jgh.15852,"Chong, R.

38102564,Subtyping irritable bowel syndrome using cluster analysis: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms. Some researchers have used cluster analysis (CA), a group of non-supervised learning methods that identifies homogenous clusters within different entities based on their similarity.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This literature review aims to identify published articles that apply CA to IBS patients. We searched relevant keywords in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. We reviewed studies in terms of the selected variables, participants' characteristics, data collection, methodology, number of clusters, clusters' profiles, and results.
RESULTS: Among the 14 articles focused on the heterogeneity of IBS, eight of them utilized K-means Cluster Analysis (K-means CA), four employed Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, and only two studies utilized Latent Class Analysis. Seven studies focused on clinical symptoms, while four articles examined anocolorectal functions. Two studies were centered around immunological findings, and only one study explored microbial composition. The number of clusters obtained ranged from two to seven, showing variation across the studies. Males exhibited lower symptom severity and fewer psychological findings. The association between symptom severity and rectal perception suggests that altered rectal perception serves as a biological indicator of IBS. Ultra-slow waves observed in IBS patients are linked to increased activity of the anal sphincter, higher anal pressure, dystonia, and dyschezia.
CONCLUSION: IBS has different subgroups based on different factors. Most IBS patients have low clinical severity, good QoL, high rectal sensitivity, delayed left colon transit time, increased systemic cytokines, and changes in microbial composition, including increased Firmicutes-associated taxa and depleted Bacteroidetes-related taxa. However, the number of clusters is inconsistent across studies due to the methodological heterogeneity. CA, a valuable non-supervised learning method, is sensitive to hyperparameters like the number of clusters and random initialization of cluster centers. The random nature of these parameters leads to diverse outcomes even with the same algorithm. This has implications for future research and practical applications, necessitating further studies to improve our understanding of IBS and develop personalized treatments.",Zarei D; Saghazadeh A; Rezaei N,2023,BMC bioinformatics,24,1,478,10.1186/s12859-023-05567-8,"Zarei, D., Saghazadeh, A., & Rezaei, N.

34049374,Postinfection Irritable Bowel Syndrome Following Clostridioides difficile Infection: A Systematic-review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) affects ~14% patients after acute bacterial enterocolitis.
AIM: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of PI-IBS following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).
METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through January 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing PI-IBS following CDI. Primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [MetaXL (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria-Rome vs. others, time of IBS diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing IBS and CDI treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I2>50%.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). Data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies. Pooled prevalence of PI-IBS was 21.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2%-35.7%), I2=96%. Common PI-IBS subtypes were diarrhea-predominant in 46.3% (50) patients, and mixed in 33.3% (36) patients. Subgroup analyses by IBS diagnostic criteria, time of IBS diagnosis or CDI treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all P>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. Funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 20% of patients develop PI-IBS after CDI. Factors such as diagnostic criteria for IBS and CDI treatment did not affect prevalence, though small numbers limit the confidence in these conclusions. Larger, well conducted studies are needed to study PI-IBS in CDI.",Saha S; Sehgal K; Singh S; Grover M; Pardi D; Khanna S,2022,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,56,2,e84-e93,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001536,"Saha, S., Sehgal, K., Singh, S., Grover, M., Pardi, D., & Khanna, S.

38837416,Bidirectional associations between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review of longitudinal studies with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.,"The bidirectional associations between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with temporal directionality remain inconclusive. This study aims to evaluate the bidirectional associations between periodontitis and IBD through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched from inception to 27 February 2024. Two independent reviewers performed a review of the retrieved studies. Longitudinal studies, including cohort and nested case-control studies, were considered eligible for the study design. The pooled risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) derived from the meta-analysis were used to assess whether periodontitis (or IBD) was a risk factor for IBD (or periodontitis). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to evaluate the reliability of the results. Four studies (n = 10 270 912) on the risk of IBD in patients with periodontitis and two (n = 33 420) on the risk of periodontitis in patients with IBD were included. The result suggested that periodontitis did not increase the risk of IBD (pooled RR = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.09; p = .164; I-squared statistic [I2] = 27%). For subtypes of IBD, periodontitis was associated with the occurrence of ulcerative colitis (UC) (pooled RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21; p = .003; I2 = 38%), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92-1.04; p = .475; I2 = 0%). Specifically, the risk of UC was higher among men (pooled HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.22; p = .025; I2 = 0%) and smokers (pooled HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.42; p = .004; I2 = 0%) with periodontitis than their counterparts without periodontitis. Patients with IBD may have a higher risk of developing periodontitis (pooled HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26-1.49; p < .001; I2 = 18%); however, whether IBD subtypes increased the occurrence of periodontitis remained uncertain. The TSA results confirmed the reliability of the primary findings. Based on limited longitudinal evidence, patients with periodontitis do not exhibit an increased risk of developing IBD overall, but they are at increased risk of UC (not CD). On the contrary, patients with IBD have a higher risk of developing periodontitis over time. More high-quality longitudinal studies are needed to determine the effect of specific subtypes of IBD on periodontitis.",Wang Q; Chen S; Zhou J; Zhao L,2024,Journal of periodontal research,59,6,1083-1094,10.1111/jre.13291,"Wang, Q., Chen, S., Zhou, J., & Zhao, L.

38740543,The impact of vedolizumab therapy on extraintestinal manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) pose a significant threat in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Vedolizumab (VDZ) primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract. However, its impact on EIMs remains uncertain. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to examine the effects of VDZ on EIMs during treatment.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by conducting thorough searches across electronic databases, including PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Primary outcomes focused on the proportion of patients with resolution for pre-existing EIMs in IBD patients receiving VDZ. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with EIM exacerbations and new onset EIMs during VDZ treatment.
RESULTS: Our meta-analysis encompassed 21 studies. The proportion of patients with resolution of pre-existing EIMs in VDZ-treated IBD patients was 39% (150/386; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.48). The proportion of patients with EIM exacerbations occurred at a rate of 28% (113/376; 95% CI 0.05-0.50), while new onset EIMs had a rate of 15% (397/2541; 95% CI 0.10-0.20). Subgroup analysis revealed a 40% (136/337) proportion of patients with resolution for articular-related EIMs and a 50% (9/18) rate for erythema nodosum. Exacerbation rates for arthritis/arthralgia, erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum, and aphthous stomatitis during VDZ use were 28% (102/328), 18% (7/38), and 11% (3/28), respectively. The incidence rate of newly developed EIMs during treatment was 11% (564/4839) for articular-related EIMs, with other EIMs below 2%.
CONCLUSION: VDZ demonstrates efficacy in skin-related EIMs like erythema nodosum and joint-related EIMs including arthritis, arthralgia, spondyloarthritis, and peripheral joint diseases.

32563588,Effects of standard treatments on depressive/anxiety symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: A combination of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psychological comorbidities can influence the natural course of IBD. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to examine whether a standard IBD medical therapy without any antipsychotic intervention has beneficial effects on depression/anxiety in IBD patients.
METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for related literature from their inception to March 2020. The random-effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). A total of 16 eligible studies were included in the present meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with baseline assessments, IBD patients with standard IBD medication had significantly reduced depression assessment scores (pooled SMD = 0.500; 95% confidence interval: 0.207, 0.793; P = 0.001). These results were obtained without any psychological interventions. Additionally, no significant differences in anxiety-related scores were detected between the baseline assessments and the end of therapy assessments (pooled SMD = 0.083; 95% confidence interval: -0.120, 0.285; P = 0.425). The meta-regression and subgroup analyses revealed that differences in assessment tools and medications might be the main source of heterogeneity.

40000943,Risk of stroke in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Current studies suggest a potential link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke. This study aimed to assess the risk of stroke in IBD patients compared to general population.
METHODS: Systematic search was done in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and CINAHL databases for studies published till September 2023. Using a random-effects model, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stroke occurrence were calculated. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate pooled HR with 95%CI for CD, UC, and overall IBD cases separately. Publication bias assessment was done by Begg's and Egger's tests.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 2,802,955 participants were included. IBD patients in general had significantly higher risk of stroke, with HR of 1.30 [95% CI 1.21-1.39]. Subgroup analysis demonstrated an HR of 1.35 [95% CI 1.22-1.49] for CD and 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.22] for UC. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across studies, with no substantial publication bias. Sensitivity analyses affirmed the stability of findings.
CONCLUSION: IBD in general, and Crohn's disease in particular are associated with significantly higher risk of stroke. Our findings further emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and management strategies in IBD care.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we quantify work-related outcomes and employment data among persons with IBD.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, Scopus, ProQuest, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to February 2023, to identify studies on work productivity in persons with IBD aged > 18 years. Work productivity was defined primarily by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment [WPAI] questionnaire which includes absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, and non-work activity impairment. In addition, we included data on employment, sick leaves, disability pensions, and indirect costs due to productivity loss. Pooled effect analysis was conducted using a random-effects model for pooled estimates of continuous and proportional data with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Among all patients with IBD, the pooled estimates were 16.4% for absenteeism, 35.9% for presenteeism, 39.4% for overall work impairment, and 46.0% for non-work activity impairment. Indirect costs from overall work impairment were 5131.09 euros/patient/year. Only two-thirds of IBD patients were employed, and one in three lost their jobs due to IBD. Among those employed, 39.5% report sick days, 21.3% report work disability, and 12.3% receive disability pensions. Most studies demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in work productivity with medical and/or surgical therapies.

To explore the efficacy of polyphenols as an adjuvant therapy for IBD, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. Literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Finally, 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. In contrast to control group, curcumin treatment significantly improved clinical remission in intention-to-treat (ITT) (OR = 3.36, 95% CI: 1.09-10.37) and per-protocol (PP) analysis (OR = 5.13, 95% CI: 1.84-14.27). Meanwhile, curcumin could significantly ameliorate endoscopic remission (OR = 5.69, 95% CI: 1.28-25.27) and clinical response (OR = 4.69, 95% CI: 1.03-21.47) in PP analysis.

37615427,Circulating and intestinal regulatory T cells in inflammatory bowel disease: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important immunosuppressive role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, findings on the quantitative and functional changes of intestinal and circulating Tregs in patients with IBD are rather contradictory. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis on this issue. The pooled effect was assessed using the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and subgroup analyses were performed to investigate heterogeneity. This analysis included 764 IBD (402 UC and 362 CD) patients and 341 healthy controls (HCs) pooled from 17 eligible studies. The percentage of circulating Tregs was significantly decreased in active IBD patients compared to HCs (SMD = -0.95, p < 0.001) and inactive IBD patients (SMD = -0.80, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the percentage of circulating Tregs between inactive IBD patients and HCs. The suppressive function of circulating Tregs was impaired in active IBD patients according to limited data (SMD = -0.75, p = 0.02). Besides, the percentage of intestinal Tregs was significantly higher in inflamed regions than in non-inflamed regions (SMD = 0.85, p < 0.001). Our study quantitatively summarized the quantitative and functional changes of Tregs and supported the therapeutic potential of Tregs in IBD.

38781004,Prebiotics for Induction and Maintenance of Remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are nondigestible carbohydrates fermented by gut bacteria into metabolites that confer health benefits. However, evidence on their role for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. This study systematically evaluated the research on prebiotics for treatment of IBD.
METHODS: A search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Eligible articles included randomized controlled trials or prospective observational studies that compared a prebiotic with a placebo or lower-dose control in patients with IBD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models for the outcomes of clinical remission, clinical relapse, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included. For induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis (UC), the fructooligosaccharide (FOS) kestose was effective (relative risk, 2.75, 95% confidence interval, 1.05-7.20; n = 40), but oligofructose-enriched inulin (OF-IN) and lactulose were not. For maintenance of remission in UC, germinated barley foodstuff trended toward preventing clinical relapse (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-1.03; n = 59), but OF-IN, oat bran, and Plantago ovata did not. For Crohn's disease, OF-IN and lactulose were no different than controls for induction of remission, and FOS was no different than controls for maintenance of remission. Flatulence and bloating were more common with OF-IN; reported adverse events were otherwise similar to controls for other prebiotics.
CONCLUSION: Prebiotics, particularly FOS and germinated barley foodstuff, show potential as effective and safe dietary supplements for induction and maintenance of remission in UC, respectively. The overall certainty of evidence was very low. There would be benefit in further investigation on the role of prebiotics as treatment adjuncts for IBD.",Limketkai BN; Godoy-Brewer G; Shah ND; Maas L; White J; Parian AM; Mullin GE,2025,Inflammatory bowel diseases,31,5,1220-1230,10.1093/ibd/izae115,"Limketkai, B.

38589784,Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy may not be safe during pregnancy in women with inflammatory bowel disease: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects reproductive-aged women. Active disease can lead to decreased fertility. Although the vast majority of international guidelines recommend for the continuation of anti-TNF-α during pregnancy, recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) therapy during pregnancy, both for patients and for physicians.
METHODS: Studies that evaluate the safety of anti-TNF-α therapy in pregnant women with IBD were identified using bibliographical searches. An updated meta-analysis was performed for pregnancy outcomes, such as live birth, abortion, still birth, preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, and neonatal infection. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported. Data on disease activity, timing of anti-TNF-α therapy were collected for further analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 11 studies were screened from on-line databases and international meeting abstracts. An increased risk of abortion (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.74; P = 0.04) and preterm birth (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28; P = 0.004), and a decreased risk of live birth (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94; P = 0.002]) were found in the anti-TNF-α therapy group compared with the control group (no use of anti-TNF-α therapy). The subgroup analyses based on the disease activity showed there is no significant association between the use of anti-TNF-α therapy during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes of abortion, preterm birth, and live birth. The rates of still birth, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities in the anti-TNF-α therapy group were not significantly different from those in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-α therapy does not increase the risks of still birth, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities; however it may be assicated with increased risks of abortion and preterm birth, which are accompanied by a lower rate of live birth. Although these findings may be confounding by potential disease activity, they offer some opposite viewpoints with biologic agent use. Therefore, more studies are required to further confirm the safety of anti-TNF-α therapy in pregnancy with IBD.",Huang W; Zhang X; Zhang L; Dai X; Chen H; Xie Q,2024,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,24,1,251,10.1186/s12884-024-06443-w,"Huang, W., Zhang, X., Zhang, L., Dai, X., Chen, H., & Xie, Q.

We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess risk factors and outcomes associated with CDI in children and adolescents with IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to 24th February, 2021. Studies investigating risk factors, bowel surgery rate in pediatric IBD patients with and without CDI were included. Random-effects model was used for calculating summary estimates. Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used for quality assessment.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies, comprising 17,114 patients, were included. There was a significant association between 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) use and CDI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-3.03], with minimal heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%). Increased risk of active disease (OR = 4.66, 95% CI 2.16-10.07) were associated with CDI in those studies performed in high quality score (NOS > 6) and significantly higher CDI rates in studies conducted outside USA (OR = 2.94, 95% CI 1.57-5.58). The bowel surgery rate in IBD with CDI was 3.8-57.1%, compared to that in IBD without CDI (0-21.3%). All studies were of moderate to high quality.
CONCLUSIONS: 5-ASA use and active disease might be risk factors associated with CDI in children and adolescents with IBD. Bowel surgery rates associated with CDI in IBD patients varied greatly. Large-scale clinical studies on CDI in children and adolescents with IBD are still needed to verify risk factors and outcomes.",Fang SB; Song YQ; Zhang CY; Wang LB,2022,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,18,1,27-36,10.1007/s12519-021-00486-1,"Fang, S.

34872306,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in the induction and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease remission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to their special conditioning effects on the intestinal flora, but their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission is still controversial. In the present study, we analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of probiotics in IBD to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission of IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, and Weipu databases were searched for RCTs on the treatment of probiotics in IBD induction and/or maintenance of remission. Two researchers independently extracted literature data and cross-checked the extracted data. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool and the Jadad score were used to evaluate the quality of the literature. RevMan 5.20 software was used for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of ten RCTs were included, which included 777 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the clinical recurrence rate of probiotics in the CD remission phase and the control group [relative risk (RR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.06, P=0.12]. The clinical recurrence rate of UC in remission phase, the efficacy of probiotics compared with control group were not significantly different (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.80-1.42, P=0.65). The induction remission rate of UC during the active phase, the efficacy of probiotics is better than that of the control group (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09-1.98, P=0.01).

32762830,Cannabis and the Gastrointestinal Tract.,"UNLABELLED: Cannabis has been used for its medicinal purposes since ancient times. Its consumption leads to the activation of Cannabis receptors CB1 and CB2 that, through specific mechanisms can lead to modulation and progression of inflammation or repair. The novel findings are linked to the medical use of Cannabis in gastrointestinal (GI) system.
PURPOSE: The objective of the present paper is to elucidate the role of Cannabis consumption in GI system. An additional aim is to review the information on the function of Cannabis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This review summarizes the recent findings on the role of cannabinoid receptors, their synthetic or natural ligands, as well as their metabolizing enzymes in normal GI function and its disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and possible adverse events. The synergism or antagonism between Cannabis' active ingredients and the ""entourage"" plays a role in the efficacy of various strains. Some elements of Cannabis may alter disease severity as over-activation of Cannabis receptors CB1 and CB2 can lead to changes of the commensal gut flora. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) contributes to gut homeostasis. The ability of ECS to modulate inflammatory responses demonstrates the capacity of ECS to preserve gastrointestinal (GI) function. Alterations of the ECS may predispose patients to pathologic disorders, including IBD. Clinical studies in IBD demonstrate that subjects benefit from Cannabis consumption as seen through a reduction of the IBD-inflammation, as well as through a decreased need for other medication. NAFLD is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver. The occurrence of inflammation in NAFLD leads to non-alcoholic-steatohepatitis (NASH). The use of Cannabis might reduce liver inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: With limited evidence of efficacy and safety of Cannabis in IBD, IBS, and NAFLD, randomized controlled studies are required to examine its therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, since long term use of the plant leads to drug use disorders the patients should be followed continuously.",Cohen L; Neuman MG,2020,"Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",23,,301-313,10.18433/jpps31242,"Cohen, L., & Neuman, M.

Judgment of diagnostic accuracy included pooled sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Ultimately, a total of 414 participants from six studies were included. The combined sensitivity, specificity, PLR, and NLR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79), 0.71 (95% CI = 0.52 to 0.85), 2.95 (95% CI = 1.71 to 5.09), and 0.21 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.51), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.85, and the DOR was 14.14 (95% CI = 4.46 to 44.80).

To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) or functional diarrhea (FD) in adults. Method. Five electronic databases-PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang-were searched, respectively, until June 8, 2020. The literature of clinical randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for the treatment of IBS-D or FD in adults were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted by Using Stata 16.0 software, the quality of the included studies was assessed by the RevMan ROB summary and graph, and the results were graded by GRADE. Result. Thirty-one studies with 3234 patients were included. Most of the studies were evaluated as low risk of bias related to selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. Nevertheless, seven studies showed the high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data. GRADE's assessments were either moderate certainty or low certainty. Compared with loperamide, acupuncture showed more effectiveness in weekly defecation (SMD = -0.29, 95% CI [-0.49, -0.08]), but no significant improvement in the result of the Bristol stool form (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.68, 0.12]). In terms of the drop-off rate, although the acupuncture group was higher than the bacillus licheniformis plus beanxit group (RR = 2.57, 95% CI [0.24, 27.65]), loperamide group (RR = 1.11, 95% CI [0.57, 2.15]), and trimebutine maleate group (RR = 1.19, 95% CI [0.31, 4.53]), respectively, it was lower than the dicetel group (RR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.56, 1.23]) and affected the overall trend (RR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.67, 1.29]). Besides, acupuncture produced more significant effect than dicetel related to the total symptom score (SMD = -1.17, 95% CI [-1.42, -0.93]), IBS quality of life (SMD = 2.37, 95% CI [1.94, 2.80]), recurrence rate (RR = 0.43, 95% CI [0.28, 0.66]), and IBS Symptom Severity Scale (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI [-1.04, -0.47]). Compared to dicetel (RR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.18, 1.32]) and trimebutine maleate (RR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.13, 1.61]), acupuncture also showed more effective at total efficiency. The more adverse effect occurred in the acupuncture group when comparing with the dicetel group (RR = 11.86, 95% CI [1.58, 89.07]) and loperamide group (RR = 4.42, 95% CI [0.57, 33.97]), but most of the adverse reactions were mild hypodermic hemorrhage.

35067654,The Prevalence and Incidence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Depression and Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The increased prevalence and incidence of affective disorders among patients with gastrointestinal disease have been well established. However, few studies have investigated the inverse relationship. We aimed to identify all pieces of evidence of the prevalence and incidence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in people with depression and bipolar disorder.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the association between affective disorders (exposure) and IBS or IBD (outcome) in adults. Evidence was evaluated for quality using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. Where suitable data were available, meta-analyses were performed.
RESULTS: We identified 18 studies that met the selection criteria, of which 11 provided data on IBS, 5 on IBD, and 2 on both. Overall, people with depression were significantly more likely to have comorbid IBS (risk ratio = 2.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.98-2.96) and to develop new-onset IBS (risk ratio = 1.90, 95% confidence interval = 1.41-2.56) compared with people without depression. They were also more likely to have and develop IBD, and among patients with IBD, significantly increased rates of depression were observed as early as 5 years before diagnosis. Bipolar disorder was not consistently associated with risk of either condition.
CONCLUSIONS: People with depression are at an increased risk of both having and developing lower gastrointestinal disorders. These findings have important implications for how we understand, manage, and prevent this comorbidity in clinical practice. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between bipolar disorder and bowel disease as well as the role of psychotropic medication, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",Nikolova VL; Pelton L; Moulton CD; Zorzato D; Cleare AJ; Young AH; Stone JM,2022,Psychosomatic medicine,84,3,313-324,10.1097/PSY.0000000000001046,"Nikolova, V.

We aimed to investigate the characteristics of IMIDs in relation to co-occurring IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of Medline and EMBASE databases from inception to September 2020. We identified studies reporting the phenotype, severity, or disease course of IMIDs among patients with or without co-occurring IBD. A meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models.
RESULTS: The electronic search yielded 13 220 studies that we narrowed down to 73 eligible studies for full-text review, including 42 on primary sclerosing cholangitis, 12 on axial spondyloarthropathies, and 8 studies on psoriasis. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, IBD was associated with less frequent involvement of extrahepatic bile ducts (risk ratio [RR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.75), longer liver transplantation-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.82), and no increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.59-1.31). Patients with axial spondyloarthropathies and co-occurring IBD were characterized by an increased risk of dactylitis (RR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.24-3.42), a lower Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Index (mean difference [MD] = -2.28; 95% CI, -3.26 to -1.30), and better Schober's test results (MD = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.64-1.49). Psoriasis and co-occurring IBD was associated with reduced disease severity (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.02-1.96) and less frequent presentation in nails (RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.05-0.42), with no apparent impact on psoriatic arthritis (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.27-3.31).

36977983,Thiols as a marker of inflammatory bowel disease activity: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is associated with increased systemic levels of reactive oxygen species. Systemic oxidative stress has been associated with reduced levels of plasma thiols. Less invasive tests capable of reflecting and predicting IBD activity are increasingly sought after. We sought to systematically review the evidence inherent in serum thiol levels as a marker of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis activity (PROSPERO: CRD42021255521).
METHODS: The highest quality documents for systematic reviews standards were used as reference. Articles were searched on Medline via PubMed, VHL, LILACS, WOS, EMBASE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, CINAHL, OVID, CTGOV, WHO/ICTRP, OPENGREY, BDTD and CAPES, between August, 03 and September, 03 on 2021. Descriptors were defined according to the Medical Subject Heading. Of the 11 articles selected for full reading, 8 were included in the review. It was not possible to perform a pooled analysis of the studies, as there were no combinable studies between subjects with active IBD and controls/inactive disease.
RESULTS: Findings from the individual studies included in this review suggest an association between disease activity and systemic oxidation, as measured by serum thiol levels, however, there are limitations that preclude weighting the study results in a meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend conducting better-designed and controlled studies, that include individuals of both phenotypes and at different stages of IBD, involving a larger number of participants, using the standardization of the technique for measuring serum thiols, to confirm whether thiols can be a good parameter for monitoring the clinical course of these intestinal diseases and the degree of clinical applicability.",Passos RA; Costa PRF; da Maia Lima CF; Santana GMS; David V; de Jesus Santos G; Zaltman C; Soares-Mota M; Rocha R,2023,BMC gastroenterology,23,1,94,10.1186/s12876-023-02711-9,"Passos, R.

37868553,Biofilm's Impact on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"The colon has a large surface area covered with a thick mucus coating. Colon's biomass consists of about 1,012 colony-forming units per gram of feces and 500-1,000 distinct bacterial species. The term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indicates the collection of intestinal illnesses in which the digestive system (esophagus, large intestine, mouth, stomach, and small intestine) experiences persistent inflammation. IBD development is influenced by environmental (infections, stress, and nutrition) and genetic factors. The microbes present in gut microbiota help maintain intestinal homeostasis and support immune and epithelial cell growth, differentiation, as well as proliferation. It has been discovered that a variety of variables and microorganisms are crucial for the development of biofilms and mucosal colonization during IBD. An extracellular matrix formed by bacteria supports biofilm production in our digestive system and harms the host's immunological response. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and IBD considerably affect human socioeconomic well-being and the standard of living. IBD is a serious public health issue, affecting millions of people across the globe. The gut microbiome may significantly influence IBS pathogenesis, even though few diagnostic and treatment options are available. As a result, current research focuses more on disrupting biofilm in IBD patients and stresses primarily on drugs that help improve the quality of life for human well-being. We evaluate studies on IBD and bacterial biofilm to add fresh insights into the existing state of knowledge of biofilm formation in IBD, incidence of IBD patients, molecular level of investigations, bacteria that are involved in the formation of biofilm, and present and down the line regimens and probiotics. Planning advanced ways to control and eradicate bacteria in biofilms should be the primary goal to add fresh insights into generating innovative diagnostic and alternative therapy options for IBD.",Palandurkar GS; Kumar S,2023,Cureus,15,9,e45510,10.7759/cureus.45510,"Palandurkar, G.

However, molecules that regulate irritable bowel syndrome have not been fully clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit the translation of target messenger RNAs. Previous studies have shown that miRNAs have critical roles in the regulation of the pathogenicity of irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, this systematic review focused on miRNAs that regulate irritable bowel syndrome. PubMed and Web of Science were searched to retrieve reference lists of eligible articles and related reviews. Original articles and reviews that reported the utility of miRNAs as potential biomarkers or targets for specific therapies of IBS that were published in English from 2004 to 2021 were included.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the proportion of patients randomized to placebo or active drug experiencing any adverse event in trials of licensed drugs for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) or diarrhea (IBS-D), and to estimate the risk of developing adverse events among patients randomized to placebo.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC and EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (through June 2021) to identify RCTs comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adults with IBS-C or IBS-D. We generated Forest plots of pooled adverse event rates in both active drug and placebo arms and pooled risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
KEY RESULTS: There were 21 RCTs of licensed drugs versus placebo in IBS-C (5953 patients placebo) and 17 in IBS-D (3854 patients placebo). Overall, 34.9% and 46.9% of placebo patients in IBS-C and IBS-D trials, respectively, developed at least one adverse event, with a statistically significantly higher risk of any adverse event and withdrawal due to an adverse event with active drug. In IBS-C and IBS-D trials, rates of each individual adverse event were generally higher with active drug. However, in IBS-C trials, only diarrhea or headache was significantly more common with active drug (RD 0.066 (95% CI 0.043-0.088) and RD 0.011 (95% CI 0.002-0.021), respectively), and in IBS-D trials only constipation, nausea, or abdominal pain (RD 0.096 (95% CI 0.054-0.138), 0.014 (95% CI 0.002-0.027), and 0.018 (95% CI 0.002-0.034), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Patients with IBS randomized to placebo have a high risk of reporting adverse events, which might relate to both nocebo and non-nocebo factors. Although patients' expectations and psychosocial factors may be involved, further understanding of the mechanisms are important to control or optimize these effects in RCTs, as well as in clinical practice.",Barberio B; Savarino EV; Black CJ; Ford AC,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,6,e14279,10.1111/nmo.14279,"Barberio, B., Savarino, E.

32801010,The Risk of Extraintestinal Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Population-based Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of developing intestinal cancer. However, less is known about the risk of extraintestinal cancers (EICs). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohorts assessing the risk of EICs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
METHODS: Only population-based studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence of EICs were included. In total, 884 studies were screened and those included were assessed for quality. Eligible studies were pooled for length of follow-up evaluation, events in the IBD population, and events or expected events in a control population for the meta-analyses.
RESULTS: In total, 40 studies were included in the systematic review and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall risk of EICs was found to be increased in both CD (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.43 [CI, 1.26, 1.63]) and UC (IRR: 1.15 [1.02, 1.31]) patients. Both CD and UC patients presented with an increased risk of skin (IRR: CD, 2.22 [1.41-3.48]; UC, 1.38 [1.12-1.71]) and hepatobiliary (IRR: CD, 2.31 [1.25-4.28]; UC, 2.05 [1.52-2.76]) malignancies. Furthermore, CD patients showed an increased risk of hematologic (IRR, 2.40 [1.81-3.18]) and lung (IRR, 1.53 [1.23-1.91]) cancers. These increased risks were present despite treatment with immunosuppressives.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that both CD and UC patients are at an increased risk of developing EICs, both overall and at specific sites. However, additional studies with longer follow-up evaluation are needed to assess the true risk of EICs posed by IBD.",Lo B; Zhao M; Vind I; Burisch J,2021,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,19,6,1117-1138.e19,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.08.015,"Lo, B., Zhao, M., Vind, I., & Burisch, J.

38199885,Acupuncture and moxibustion for irritable bowel syndrome: An umbrella systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS. Many systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS have been published in recent years, but their results are not entirely consistent.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the methodological, reporting, and evidence quality of systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS published before February 20, 2023 were searched in eight databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and China Biology Medicine. The keywords used for literature search were acupuncture, moxibustion, systematic review, meta-analysis, and irritable bowel syndrome.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Relevant information was independently extracted by two investigators. The A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020), and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) were used to evaluate the methodological quality, reporting quality and evidence quality, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 342 studies were retrieved and 15 systematic reviews were included. The results of AMSTAR 2 showed low methodological quality in 2 studies and very low methodological quality in the remaining 13 studies, with main issues being failure to register a protocol, incomplete search strategy, not providing a list of excluded studies, incomplete consideration of the risk of bias in the included studies, and a failure to assess the publication bias. The results of PRISMA 2020 showed seriously deficient reporting quality of 2 studies, somewhat deficient reporting quality of 12 studies, and relatively complete reporting quality of 1 study, with the main problems being lack of a complete search strategy, non-availability of a list of excluded studies with justification for their exclusion, not conducting heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses, not evaluating the credibility of the evidence, and not registering the protocol. The results of GRADE showed that the quality of the evidence is low or very low.
CONCLUSION: Most included systematic reviews interpreted findings to suggest that acupuncture and moxibustion have benefits for IBS. However, there is a need to improve the methodological, reporting and evidence quality of the systematic reviews. Larger, multicenter, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials and high-quality systematic reviews are required to obtain more robust evidence.

36182873,"The incidence, clinical characteristics and serological characteristics of anti-tumor necrosis factor-induced lupus in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: There are concerns regarding anti-TNF-induced lupus (ATIL) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis about the incidence, the clinical characteristics and serological characteristics of ATIL secondary to anti-TNF agents in IBD patients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Primary outcomes were the pooled ATIL incidence rates in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. Secondary outcomes were the pooled clinical symptoms incidence rates, autoantibodies incidence rates and clinical resolution rates in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 2.5%. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in UC and CD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in IBD patients treated with IFX and ADA was 4.5% and 0.2%, respectively. The pooled arthritis, mucocutaneous symptom, myalgia and fatigue incidence rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 87.2%, 29.4%, 23.9% and 41.8%, respectively. The pooled ANA rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 97.3%. The pooled anti-dsDNA antibody rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 73.9%.
CONCLUSION: ATIL has a low prevalence in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. ATIL occurs more frequently in CD patients than in UC patients. Arthritis, fatigue and mucocutaneous lesions were found to be common symptoms of ATIL. Patients with ATIL were more likely to develop ANA and anti-dsDNA.",Dai C; Wang YN; Tian WN; Huang YH; Jiang M,2022,International immunopharmacology,112,,109269,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109269,"Dai, C., Wang, Y.

34752585,Coping Strategies and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities. While psychosocial determinants were intently studied, coping strategies with stress used by IBS patients were never comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize the coping strategies used by IBS patients and to identify which tools are frequently used to measure coping strategies.
METHODS: According to PRISMA guidelines, we searched for articles indexed in PubMed, EBSCOhost, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. The search terms included: (coping OR coping strategies OR coping mechanism) AND (irritable bowel syndrome OR IBS). The initial search identified 756 articles. After applying all filters (human filters, excluding conference abstracts and conference papers), 96 studies remained. Finally, a total of 21 articles were included in this systematic review.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles using fifteen coping instruments and six measures of quality of life were found. One was interventional, one longitudinal, and the rest were cross-sectional studies. One study was qualitative, while the rest used quantitative measures. Emotion-focused coping was associated with worse psychological outcomes, while the effect of problem-focused coping was not regularly associated with better psychological outcomes. Catastrophizing was negatively associated with health-related quality of life. Psychological distress (anxiety, depression) was significantly related to the impairment of health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Patients with IBS cope in different ways when confronted with health and daily-life stressors. The maladaptive strategy of coping is associated with poor health-related quality of life and psychiatric comorbidities but methodological problems limit conclusions regarding the strength and nature of this association. Future research needs to focus on which strategies are most effective at reducing psychological distress in IBS patients.",David L; Fadgyas Stanculete M; Bolba AR; Chiaroni G; Barsan M; Popa SL,2021,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,30,4,485-494,10.15403/jgld-3937,"David, L., Fadgyas Stanculete, M., Bolba, A.

33960587,Efficacy and safety of biophenol-rich nutraceuticals in adults with inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases or irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"AIM: Biophenol-rich nutraceuticals may be an adjuvant treatment for Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of biophenol-rich nutraceutical supplementation on CD, UC, SUDD, and IBS on gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS), quality of life (QoL), inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, and adverse events compared to usual care or placebo.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched for randomised controlled trials until 27 April 2020. Outcomes were GIS, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, QoL, and adverse events. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and GRADE were used to appraise studies. Data were pooled using Revman.
RESULTS: Twenty-three trials in CD, UC, and IBS patients were included. Compared with placebo, biophenol-rich nutraceuticals improved GIS (SMD: 0.43 [95%CI: 0.22, 0.63]; GRADE: very low) in UC, CD, and IBS participants. In UC and CD participants, biophenol-rich nutraceuticals improved CRP by 1.6 mg/L [95%CI:0.08, 3.11; GRADE: low], malondialdehyde by 1 mmol/L [95%CI:0.55, 1.38; GRADE: low]; but only resveratrol improved QoL (SMD: -0.84 [95%CI: -1.24, -0.44; GRADE: high). Resveratrol (for UC and CD participants) and peppermint oil (for IBS participants) had greater certainty in the evidence for improving GIS and QoL (GRADE: moderate to high). There was no effect on adverse events (P > .05).

33210980,Risk and outcomes of coronavirus disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in inflammatory bowel disease are unclear.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1.44-11.17]) and 6.59 [3.25-13.35], respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use.

36821458,Probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: review of mechanisms and effectiveness.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has been linked with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this article is to critically review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: The GI microbiome is strongly influenced by ageing, diet and disease. Probiotics may confer health effects to the host by modulating the metabolic activities of the microbiome to propagate anti-inflammatory effects and reinforce the intestinal barrier, and are considered to be safe to use. Many short-term studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of probiotics overall in IBS, with meta-analyses demonstrating efficacy across specific strains albeit with relatively small effect sizes. Within IBD, some probiotics appear to offer clinical benefit in ulcerative colitis but strain-specific effects are unclear. Evidence for the use of probiotics in Crohn's disease remains limited.
SUMMARY: Probiotics offer considerable potential for the management of IBS and possibly in IBD, however, any benefits conferred appear to be strain-specific. High quality trials of specific probiotics in IBS and IBD, as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action, are required in order to fully understand their potential therapeutic value.",So D; Quigley EMM; Whelan K,2023,Current opinion in gastroenterology,39,2,103-109,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000902,"So, D., Quigley, E.

34050786,Prevalence and risk factors of sexual dysfunction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Sexual dysfunction (SD) is increasingly identified in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but there are few systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the studies of SD in IBD patients. The purpose of the study is to further quantify the association between IBD and SD.
METHODS: MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), and the Cochrane Library (OVID) were searched (until August 2020) to identify observational studies that reported the prevalence and risk factors of SD in IBD patients. Pooled prevalence, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 945 citations evaluated, 18 studies (including 36,676 subjects) reporting the prevalence of SD in the IBD population were included for analysis. The overall pooled prevalence was 39% (95% CI 37-40%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of SD in women was 53% (95% CI 50-55%, P < 0.001), and it was 27% (95% CI 25-29%, P < 0.001) in men. The prevalence was higher in conjunction with operation (OR, 1.33, 95% CI 1.22-1.45, P < 0.001), depression (OR 6.14, 95% CI 3.51-10.76, P < 0.001), disease activity (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.32-5.64, P = 0.007), comorbidities (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.06-5.00, P < 0.001), age < 50 years (OR 3.85, 95% CI 2.41-6.14, P < 0.001), and the need for corticosteroids (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.48-4.66, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: SD occurred frequently in the IBD population. Operation, depression, disease activity, comorbidities, age < 50 years, and the need for corticosteroids were risk factors for SD in IBD patients.

33010814,Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often report symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which might have an effect on psychological health. However, previous estimates of the magnitude of this issue have not accounted for ongoing inflammation as the potential cause. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis to determine prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in patients with IBD in remission to better quantify the magnitude of this issue.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, Embase, Embase Classic, and MEDLINE were searched (from Jan 1, 2012, to May 11, 2020) to identify prospective case-control or cross-sectional studies reporting prevalence of symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for IBS in adults with IBD in remission. Studies were required to have recruited an unselected adult population (more than 90% of participants aged ≥16 years) with histologically or radiologically confirmed IBD and include at least 50 participants. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated according to the definition of remission, criteria used to define IBS-type symptoms, and type of IBD. The association between IBS-type symptom reporting and psychological comorbidity was examined using weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) in anxiety and depression scores between those reporting IBS-type symptoms and those not, for cases in which these data were available.
FINDINGS: Of 3370 studies identified, 27 were eligible, of which 18 were newly identified. Among 3169 patients with IBD in remission, pooled prevalence of IBS-type symptoms was 32·5% (95% CI 27·4-37·9; I2=90·1%). Prevalence was lower when remission was defined by endoscopic assessment (23·5%, 95% CI 17·9-29·6; I2=59·9%) or histological assessment (25.8%, 95% CI 20.2-31.7; I2=not applicable) than when defined by validated clinical disease activity index (33·6%, 26·3-41·2; I2=91·8%) and higher in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis (36·6%, 29·5-44·0; I2=82·9% vs 28·7%, 22·9-34·8; I2=87·2%). Anxiety (WMD 2·5; 95% CI 0·8-4·3) and depression (SMD 0·64; 0·44-0·84) scores were significantly higher among those who reported IBS-type symptoms than in those who did not.
INTERPRETATION: Prevalence of symptoms compatible with IBS in patients with IBD varied according to how remission was defined. However, even when stringent criteria such as endoscopic or histological remission were used, about a quarter of patients reported these symptoms. Such symptoms were more common in patients with Crohn's disease and were associated with psychological comorbidity. Addressing psychological wellbeing might improve outcomes in this specific group of patients.

37494961,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between polycystic ovary syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Research on the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients has gained significant momentum over the years. However, it remains unclear whether PCOS is related to a higher prevalence of IBS. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to fully study IBS correlation with PCOS.
METHODS: From inception until October 16th, 2022, all observational studies documenting IBS prevalence in PCOS patients were collected from the China national knowledge infrastructure(CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database(VIP), Wanfang database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. The quality of case-control studies was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Review Manager 5.3 was used to determine the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: 5 case-control studies involving 1268 individuals and one cross-sectional study involving 291 participants were included in our qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis was conducted based on five case-control studies. Four case-control studies involving 1063 participants showed a higher prevalence of IBS in PCOS This meta-analysis revealed an almost twice higher risk of IBS in comparison with controls (OR = 2.23, 95%CI:1.58-3.14, p < 0.001; I2=41%, p = 0.150).

38004138,Examining the Association between Coffee Intake and the Risk of Developing Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of brain-gut interaction with a significant impact on quality of life. Coffee is a widely consumed beverage with numerous bioactive compounds that have potential effects on human health and disease states. Current studies on the effect of regular coffee consumption on the risk of developing IBS symptoms have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether coffee intake is associated with developing IBS. A systematic literature search was performed in three electronic databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, from inception until 31 March 2023. All original studies reporting associations between coffee intake and IBS were considered for inclusion. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study, and estimates were pooled, and where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values were calculated. Eight studies comprising 432,022 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. Using a fixed-effects model, coffee drinkers (any intake) had a reduced likelihood of developing IBS compared to controls, with a pooled OR of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.84). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the estimates. Future research should prioritise prospective cohort studies that are robust and closely track the development of incident IBS in previously healthy individuals.",Lee JY; Yau CY; Loh CYL; Lim WS; Teoh SE; Yau CE; Ong C; Thumboo J; Namasivayam VSO; Ng QX,2023,Nutrients,15,22,,10.3390/nu15224745,"Lee, J.

32316404,Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Gluten-Related Disorders.,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently associated with celiac disease (CD) and nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS), but epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects are still unclear. Furthermore, a gluten-free diet (GFD) can positively influence IBS symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive online search for IBS related to CD, NCGS and GFD was made using the Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases. Results: Although a systematic screening for CD in IBS is not recommended, CD prevalence can be increased in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. On the other hand, IBS symptoms can be persistent in treated CD patients, and their prevalence tends to decrease on a GFD. IBS symptoms may overlap and be similar to those associated to nonceliac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity. Increased gut permeability could explain the gluten/wheat effects in IBS patients. Finally, a GFD could improve symptoms in a subgroup of IBS patients. Conclusions: The possible interplay between IBS and gluten-related disorders represents a scientifically and clinically challenging issue. Further studies are needed to confirm these data and better clarify the involved pathophysiological mechanisms.",Usai-Satta P; Bassotti G; Bellini M; Oppia F; Lai M; Cabras F,2020,Nutrients,12,4,,10.3390/nu12041117,"Usai-Satta, P., Bassotti, G., Bellini, M., Oppia, F., Lai, M., & Cabras, F.

33576711,"Inflammatory bowel disease: tri-directional relationship between microbiota, immune system and intestinal epithelium.","Human gut microbiota contributes to host nutrition and metabolism, sustains intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, and modulates host immune system. The alterations in their composition lead to severe gut disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are gamut of chronic inflammatory disorders of gut, mediated by complex interrelations among genetic, environmental, and internal factors. IBD has debateable aetiology, however in recent years, exploring the central role of a tri-directional relationship between gut microbiota, mucosal immune system, and intestinal epithelium in pathogenesis is getting the most attention. Increasing incidences and early onset explains the exponential rise in IBD burden on health-care systems. Industrialization, hypersensitivity to allergens, lifestyle, hygiene hypothesis, loss of intestinal worms, and gut microbial composition, explains this shifted rise. Hitherto, the interventions modulating gut microbiota composition, microfluidics-based in vitro gastrointestinal models, non-allergic functional foods, nutraceuticals, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors are some of the futuristic approaches for the disease management.",Ahlawat S; Kumar P; Mohan H; Goyal S; Sharma KK,2021,Critical reviews in microbiology,47,2,254-273,10.1080/1040841X.2021.1876631,"Ahlawat, S., Kumar, P., Mohan, H., Goyal, S., & Sharma, K.

39575029,Probiotic Potential in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Comprehensive Systematic Review.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are prevalent gastrointestinal disorders with significant global prevalence. Conventional treatments often have adverse effects, prompting interest in probiotics as alternative therapies. This systematic review assesses the efficacy of probiotics in managing symptoms and improving outcomes in adult patients with IBS and IBD. A comprehensive search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar and registers ClinicalTrials.gov and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN). Using targeted keywords, studies on probiotic efficacy in adult IBS and IBD patients were identified. Data screening, extraction, and quality assessment using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies were rigorously performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. From the initial 22,037 references, 18 randomized control trials and two observational studies encompassing 2,675 adults, aged 18-76 years, were deemed eligible. The efficacy of probiotics for IBS and IBD is variable. While some IBS trials show symptom improvement, the results are inconsistent, likely due to the diversity of probiotic strains and patient populations studied. In contrast, probiotics demonstrate more consistent benefits for ulcerative colitis (UC) in IBD, particularly with specific formulations like the De Simone combination. However, probiotics' effects on Crohn's disease (CD) remain less clear, highlighting the need for further research to optimize probiotic regimens and understand their differential effects across the spectrum of IBS and IBD.",Manandhar A; Sabir G; Abdelhady HA; Oumar Abakar A; Gangavarapu RR; Mahmud SA; Malasevskaia I,2024,Cureus,16,10,e72089,10.7759/cureus.72089,"Manandhar, A., Sabir, G., Abdelhady, H.

40442831,Prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Although prior studies alluded to the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and osteoporosis, the exact prevalence of osteoporosis in this patient population remains variably reported. Therefore, we aimed to systematically explore the overall prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with IBD.
METHODS: We searched in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus, from the inception until 31 May 2024. We included studies that reported cross-sectional data on the prevalence of osteoporosis in at least 100 adult (≥ 18 years) patients with IBD. We combined the data extracted from the eligible studies to obtain pooled estimates using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included, comprising 417,298 patients with IBD. Our analysis showed that the overall pooled prevalence of osteoporosis in IBD patients was 12.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.1-15.3; I2 = 99.7%), with varying rates by country. We also found that the osteoporosis risk in patients with IBD increased versus controls (pooled odds ratio = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.24-2.16). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of osteoporosis by disease type (Crohn's disease, 14.9% [95% CI: 8.8-20.9]; ulcerative colitis, 11.4% [95% CI: 5.8-17.0]; p for interaction = 0.408) and sex (men, 9.6% [95% CI: 3.0-16.3]; women, 10.5% [95% CI: 6.8-14.1]; p for interaction = 0.832).
CONCLUSION: There is a significant prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with IBD, though variations by disease type and sex are not probably observed. We witnessed high heterogeneity among the studies.

37346013,Prevalence of NUDT15 Genetic Variants and Incidence of Thiopurine-induced Leukopenia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nudix hydrolase 15 [NUDT15] genetic variants confer an increased risk of thiopurine-induced leukopenia [TIL]; however, their global prevalence in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the global prevalence of NUDT15 variants in IBD patients and incidence of TIL in these patients.
METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception until July 2022. Studies reporting the frequency of any NUDT15 variant and/or frequency of leukopenia in adult IBD patients with these variants were included. A random effects model was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of variants, incidence of early [≤8 weeks] and late [>8 weeks] leukopenia, and relative risk of developing leukopenia.
RESULTS: Twenty studies comprising 5232 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of the *1/*3 c.415C > T C/T diplotype was 13% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10-18%), *3/*3 c.415C > T T/T diplotype was 2% [95% CI: 1-2%], *1/*5 c.52G > A G/A diplotype was 2% [95% CI: 1-3%], and *1/*6 c.36_37insGGAGTC ins/- diplotype was 7% [95% CI: 4-12%]. The pooled prevalence of *1/*3 was high in Japanese [20%, 95% CI: 16-24%] and Chinese patients [18%, 95% CI: 12-27%]. The incidence of early leukopenia was 20% [95% CI: 16-26%] in *1/*3 patients, 99% [95% CI: 7-100%] in *3/*3 patients, and 49% [95% CI: 29-69%] in *1/*6 patients. The incidence of late leukopenia was 36% [95% CI: 26-49%] in *1/*3 patients.

36573039,Factors influencing rectal hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A frequent, although not universal, feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is heightened sensitivity to mechanical stimulation of the rectum, termed rectal hypersensitivity (RH). Differences in RH-based on sex, IBS subtype, IBS diagnostic criteria and age of population studied are incompletely understood. We aimed to determine whether IBS population had lower pain thresholds than healthy controls.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1970-2021). Prospective studies that compared pain/discomfort thresholds to mechanical rectal stimuli in IBS and healthy controls were included. Data were pooled for meta-analyses and effect sizes were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CIs).
RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 809 studies of which 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. Reduced rectal pain thresholds was more common in IBS patients compared to healthy controls with an effect size of 1.00 95% CIs (0.77-1.24) (p < 0.0001) (I2 = 78.6%). The pediatric IBS population had lower pain thresholds than adult IBS populations (p = 0.05) but no difference based on IBS diagnostic criteria, subtype or sex.
CONCLUSION & INFERENCES: The results suggest that reduced rectal pain threshold to experimental stimulation is far more common in IBS patients than healthy controls.

35905421,Risk of Cervical Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Population-Based Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: There is increased risk of several malignancies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, evidence regarding risk of cervical cancer in IBD is conflicting. We aimed to investigate the risk of cervical cancer in IBD by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis of unselected, population-based studies.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched using Medical Subject Heading terms, and 2 reviewers independently screened results. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random effects model meta-analysis for risk of cervical cancer in IBD. Subgroup meta-analysis was undertaken to assess risk of cervical cancer by IBD subtype (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), treatment exposure, and grade of lesion.
RESULTS: We screened 1,393 articles to identify 5 population-based studies, including 74,310 patients with IBD and 2,029,087 reference patients, across 5 different countries. Pooled random effects model meta-analysis of these studies did not show statistically significant increased risk for cervical cancer in IBD compared with reference populations (HR: 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-1.63). Meta-analysis by grade of lesion showed increased risk of low-grade cervical lesions (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04-1.28). Meta-analysis by disease subtype indicated no statistically significant increased risk in Crohn's disease (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.83-2.23) or ulcerative colitis (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.72-1.25) or in patients treated with antitumor necrosis factor (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.64-2.21) or thiopurines (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.60-1.50).
DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis of high-quality, unselected population-based studies shows no statistically significant increased risk of cervical cancer in patients with IBD.

32236745,"Rectal stump management in inflammatory bowel disease: a cohort study, systematic review and proportional analysis of perioperative complications.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse local single-institution data and perform a systematic review of the literature to calculate precise risk estimates of rectal stump-related morbidity and mortality following subtotal colectomy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's colitis, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis.
METHODS: Institutional information systems were interrogated to obtain local patient data. A systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant articles. Fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was performed to calculate pooled incidence estimates, including local data.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included locally and all had their rectal stump closed intra-abdominally. Four patients (8.3%) had a rectal stump perforation and 30-day mortality was 0. Fourteen papers were included in our review alongside local data, with a total of 1330 patients included. Pooled mortality was 1.7% (95% confidence interval, CI 1.0-2.8), pooled incidence of pelvic abscess/sepsis, stump leak and wound infection was 5.7% (95% CI 4.4-7.3), 4.9% (95% CI 3.7-6.6) and 11.3% (95% CI 7.8-16), respectively. Subcutaneous placement of the stump was associated with the highest incidence of stump leak (12.6%, 95% CI 8.3-18.6), and closure of the stump with both staples and suture was associated with the highest incidence of pelvic abscess (11.1%, 95% CI 5.8-20.3). Mortality and the incidence of wound infection were similar across stump closure techniques. There was evidence suggesting considerable heterogeneity and publication bias among studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides estimates of morbidity associated with the rectal stump after subtotal colectomy for IBD. A closed intra-abdominal stump seems to be associated with the highest rate of pelvic abscess/sepsis.

METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were followed, and the protocol was registered at Prospero (ID: CRD42021233890). Literature was searched in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase. Original papers on prevalence rates of diagnosed psychiatric disorders and/or suicide in paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD), rheumatic diseases (RD) and autoimmune liver diseases were selected. Pooled prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders (grouped according to ICD-10 criteria) within the various IMID were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included; 13 describing psychiatric disorders in pIBD and 10 in RD. Anxiety and mood disorders were mostly investigated with pooled prevalence rates in pIBD of 6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4%-9%) and 4% (95%CI: 2%-8%), respectively, in register-based studies, and 33% (95%CI: 25%-41%) and 18% (95%CI: 12%-26%), respectively, in studies using psychiatric assessment. In RD, rates were 13% (95%CI: 12%-15%) for anxiety disorders and 20% (95%CI: 15%-26%) for mood disorders based on psychiatric assessment.

33027089,The patient with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms: when to investigate and how?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder whose clinical presentation varies considerably between patients as well as within the same individual over time. Many of its symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating, may be manifestations of a host of other gastrointestinal diseases; some accompanied by increased mortality. This presents the clinician with a real dilemma: how to sensibly investigate the patient in which one suspects IBS but there is a nagging doubt that 'it could be something else'? Could one miss 'something serious'? This short review attempts to provide both an evidence-based response to these vexing questions and a practical guide to detecting alternative diagnoses in the subject with IBS-type symptoms.
RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical features, patient demographics and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with IBS-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of IBS. The advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. In the older, female diarrhea sufferer microscopic colitis should be considered. The role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant IBS is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS remain uncertain.
SUMMARY: Attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with IBS-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation. Wherever indicated, widely available serological and fecal tests will serve to bolster the diagnosis by excluding other options. Proceeding to more invasive testing should be dictated by clinical presentation and scenario with the threshold for intervention being generally lower among those with prominent diarrhea.",Quigley EMM,2021,Current opinion in gastroenterology,37,1,39-43,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000686,"Quigley, E.

38479936,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, distension, and altered bowel habits. Probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms, but clinical trials remain conflicting.
AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for IBS patients.
METHODS: We searched relevant trials in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 2000 to June 2023. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes. A risk ratio (RR) and a 95% CI were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies involving 3011 patients were obtained. The results demonstrated that probiotics are more effective than placebo in reducing global IBS symptoms improvement rate (RR = 1.401, 95% CI 1.182-1.662, P < 0.001) and quality of life scores (SMD = 0.286, 95% CI = 0.154-0.418, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that a shorter treatment time (less than eight weeks) could reduce distension scores (SMD = 0.197, 95% CI = 0.038-0.356, P = 0.015). High doses (daily dose of probiotics ≥ 10ˆ10) or multiple strains of probiotics exhibit beneficial effects on abdominal pain (SMD = 0.412, 95% CI = 0.112-0.711, P = 0.007; SMD = 0.590, 95% CI = 0.050-1.129, P = 0.032; respectively). However, there was no significant benefit on global symptom scores (SMD = 0.387, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.653, P = 0.004) with statistically high inter-study heterogeneity (I2 = 91.9%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, there was no significant inter-group difference in terms of adverse events frequency (RR = 0.997, 95% CI 0.845-1.177, P = 0.973).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective and safe for IBS patients. High doses or multiple probiotic strains seem preferable, but definite conclusions are challenging due to the high heterogeneity. Large-scale, well-designed, and rigorous trials are needed to confirm their effectiveness.",Yang R; Jiang J; Ouyang J; Zhao Y; Xi B,2024,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,60,,362-372,10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.02.025,"Yang, R., Jiang, J., Ouyang, J., Zhao, Y., & Xi, B.

39459580,New Role of the Serotonin as a Biomarker of Gut-Brain Interaction.,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT), a neurotransmitter that regulates mood in the brain and signaling in the gut, has receptors throughout the body that serve various functions, especially in the gut and brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat depression, but their efficacy is uncertain. Depression is often associated with early gastrointestinal symptoms. Gut disorders such as functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are linked to elevated serotonin levels. In this review, we would like to discuss the approach of using serotonin as a biomarker for gut-brain, and body-wide organ communication may lead to the development of preventive and innovative treatments for gut-brain disorders, offering improved visibility and therapeutic monitoring. It could also be used to gauge stress intensity for self-care and mental health improvement.",Liu HN; Nakamura M; Kawashima H,2024,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",14,10,,10.3390/life14101280,"Liu, H.

37897138,A systematic review and meta-analysis of diet and nutrient intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous individual and environmental factors including diet may play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear to what degree dietary intake is affected in individuals with IBS. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize dietary intake of adults with IBS and to compare dietary intake between adults with IBS and non-IBS controls.
METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched through February 2023 for clinical trials and observational studies measuring usual diet in adults with IBS. Pooled weighted averages were estimated for total energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient data. Mean differences (MD) in nutrient intake were estimated for adults with IBS versus non-IBS controls using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the inconsistency index (I2).
KEY RESULTS: Sixty-three full-text articles were included in the review of which 29 studies included both IBS and control subjects. Nutrients not meeting the recommended intake level for any dietary reference values in the IBS population were fiber and vitamin D. Meta-regression by female proportion was positively correlated with total fat intake and negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake. Comparisons between participants with IBS and controls showed significantly lower fiber intake in participants with IBS with high heterogeneity (MD: -1.8; 95% CI: -3.0, -0.6; I2 = 85%).
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: This review suggests that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS; however, overall dietary intake does not appear to be comprised. Causes and consequences of reduced fiber in IBS deserve further study. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS. However, overall intake of other macro- and micronutrients does not appear to be compromised.

32047894,Risk of Postoperative Infectious Complications From Medical Therapies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery.
METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases and reference lists of articles dating up to August 2018 for prospective and retrospective studies comparing postoperative infection risk in patients treated with an IBD medication perioperatively with the risk in patients who were not taking that medication. Outcomes were overall infectious complications and intra-abdominal infections within 30 days of surgery.
RESULTS: Sixty-three studies were included. Overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (odds ratio [OR] 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.50) and corticosteroids (OR 1.34; 95% CI, 1.25-1.44) and decreased in those who received 5-aminosalicylic acid (OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87). No difference was observed in those treated with immunomodulators (OR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.25) or anti-integrin agents (OR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.67-1.69). Both corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents were associated with increased intra-abdominal infection risk (OR 1.63; 95% CI, 1.33-2.00 and OR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.08-1.97, respectively), whereas no impact was observed with 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, or anti-integrin therapy. Twenty-two studies had low risk of bias while the remaining studies had very high risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents were associated with increased overall postoperative infection risk as well as intra-abdominal infection in IBD patients, whereas no increased risk was observed for immunomodulators or anti-integrin therapy. Although these results may result from residual confounding rather than from a true biological effect, prospective studies that control for potential confounding factors are required to generate higher-quality evidence.",Law CCY; Koh D; Bao Y; Jairath V; Narula N,2020,Inflammatory bowel diseases,26,12,1796-1807,10.1093/ibd/izaa020,"Law, C.

A clinician will undoubtedly encounter the presence of this parasite numerous times in their career. Thus, it is vital to know if this organism is a 'friend or foe', or in other words, whether it is a commensal or a pathogen. This will help clinicians decide whether to treat or not. This literature review discusses the best available evidence of the association of B. hominis and two diseases- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Particularly, focus has been paid to the effect of antimicrobial therapy in improving disease activity/symptoms and concluding on the pathogenicity of B. hominis based on in vitro, observational studies, and randomized controlled trials.

34927756,Review article: Diagnosis and investigation of irritable bowel syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction. It is defined by the Rome criteria as the presence of abdominal pain, related to defaecation, associated with a change in stool form and/or frequency. The approach to diagnosis and investigation of suspected IBS varies between clinicians and, due in part to the uncertainty that can surround the diagnosis, many still consider it to be a diagnosis of exclusion. However, exhaustive investigation is both unnecessary and costly, and may also be counterproductive. Instead, physicians should aim to make a positive diagnosis, based on their clinical assessment of symptoms, and limit their use of investigations. The yield of routine blood tests in suspected IBS is low overall, but normal inflammatory markers may be reassuring. All patients should have serological testing for coeliac disease, irrespective of their predominant stool form. Routine testing of stool microbiology or faecal elastase is unnecessary; however, all patients with diarrhoea aged <45 should have a faecal calprotectin or a similar marker measured which, if positive, should lead to colonoscopy to exclude possible inflammatory bowel disease. Colonoscopy should also be undertaken in any patient reporting alarm symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer, and in those whose presentation raises suspicion for microscopic colitis. Testing for bile acid diarrhoea should be considered for patients with IBS with diarrhoea where available. Hydrogen breath tests for lactose malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth have no role in the routine assessment of suspected IBS. Adopting a standardised approach to the diagnosis and investigation of IBS will help to promote high-quality and high-value care for patients overall.",Black CJ,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54 Suppl 1,,S33-S43,10.1111/apt.16597,"Black, C.

33175122,The Influence of Disease Activity on Pregnancy Outcomes in Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Robust evidence regarding the impact of disease activity on pregnancy outcomes in women with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is crucial for both clinicians and patients in preparing a birth plan. We sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the pooled influences of disease activity on pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the COCHRANE library to identify articles comparing pregnancy outcomes between active and inactive IBD at the time of conception or during pregnancy. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to pool estimates and report odds ratios [ORs].
RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were identified as eligible for the meta-analysis. In women with active IBD, the pooled ORs for low birth weight [LBW], preterm birth, small for gestational age [SGA], spontaneous abortion and stillbirths were respectively 3.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-8.02), 2.42 [95% CI 1.74-3.35], 1.48 [95% CI 1.19-1.85], 1.87 [95% CI 1.17-3.0] and 2.27 [95% CI 1.03-5.04] compared to women with inactive IBD. In the subgroup analysis based on disease type, women with active ulcerative colitis had an increased risk of LBW, preterm birth and spontaneous abortion. Women with active Crohn's disease had a higher risk of preterm birth, SGA and spontaneous abortion.
CONCLUSIONS: Active IBD during the periconception period and pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our data suggest that pregnancy should be planned when the disease is quiescent, and continuous disease control is important even during pregnancy.",Kim MA; Kim YH; Chun J; Lee HS; Park SJ; Cheon JH; Kim TI; Kim WH; Park JJ,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,5,719-732,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa225,"Kim, M.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects the quality of life of numerous people worldwide.Gap statement. The therapeutic role of gut microbiota modulation in IBS remains controversial.Aim. We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in patients with IBS.Methodology. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 August 2023, to identify the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics among patients with IBS. Pooled analyses of the effects of probiotics in relieving IBS symptoms were calculated using a random-effects model. Further subgroup analyses were performed by different genera, doses and duration of treatment.Results. Our final analysis included 52 trials involving 6289 IBS patients. Probiotics significantly increased the overall response rate (RR:1.64; P<0.00001), subjective relief rate (RR:1.50; P=0.0002) and abdominal pain relief rate (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). As for specific genera, mixed probiotics (RR:1.41; P=0.0001), Bifidobacterium (RR:1.76; P<0.00001), Lactobacillus (RR:1.97; P=0.0004) and Saccharomyces (RR:1.31; P=0.0004) markedly relieved IBS symptoms. Mixed probiotics (RR:1.31; P=0.005), Lactobacillus (RR:2.22; P=0.04) and Bifidobacterium (RR:1.62; P<0.0001) elevated patients' subjective relief rate. Besides, probiotics effectively relieved the abdominal pain in IBS patients (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). Probiotics appeared to show a remarkable beneficial role at a dose of 109 c.f.u./day or above (RR:1.662; P<0.0001) and started to work at 4 weeks (RR 1.72; P<0.00001). Efficacy of prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS remained uncertain, due to the deficiency of available RCTs.Conclusions. Probiotics have a therapeutic role in IBS. However, the effect of different probiotics varies. The minimal effective dose of probiotics may be 109 c.f.u./day. With appropriate probiotic formula, the therapeutic effect can occur at 4 weeks. These data provide a basis for further research on the optimal probiotic therapy in IBS.",Zhang WX; Shi LB; Zhou MS; Wu J; Shi HY,2023,Journal of medical microbiology,72,9,,10.1099/jmm.0.001758,"Zhang, W.

33167889,The effects of resistant starches on inflammatory bowel disease in preclinical and clinical settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating chronic disease with limited treatment options. Resistant starches may represent a novel treatment for IBD. However, its efficacy and safety remain unclear. Our objective was to perform a systematic review to summarize the preclinical and clinical effects of resistant starch, which may help guide future studies.
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched. Included studies investigated the use of resistant starch therapy in in vivo animal models of IBD or human patients with IBD. Articles were screened, and data extracted, independently and in duplicate. The primary outcomes were clinical remission (clinical) and bowel mucosal damage (preclinical).
RESULTS: 21 preclinical (n = 989 animals) and seven clinical (n = 164 patients) studies met eligibility. Preclinically, resistant starch was associated with a significant reduction in bowel mucosal damage compared to placebo (standardized mean difference - 1.83, 95% CI - 2.45 to - 1.20). Clinically, five studies reported data on clinical remission but clinical and methodological heterogeneity precluded pooling. In all five, a positive effect was seen in patients who consumed resistant starch supplemented diets. The majority of studies in both the preclinical and clinical settings were at a high or unclear risk of bias due to poor methodological reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review demonstrates that resistant starch is associated with reduced histology damage in animal studies, and improvements in clinical remission in IBD patients. These results need to be tempered by the risk of bias of included studies. Rigorously designed preclinical and clinical studies are warranted.

39777150,Meta-analysis of gut microbiota alterations in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic disorder of gastrointestinal function with a high prevalence worldwide. Due to its complex pathogenesis and heterogeneity, there is urrently no consensus in IBS research.
METHODS: We collected and uniformly reanalyzed 1167 fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing samples (623 from IBS patients and 544 from healthy subjects) from 9 studies. Using both a random effects (RE) model and a fixed effects (FE) model, we calculated the odds ratios for metrics including bacterial alpha diversity, beta diversity, common genera and pathways between the IBS and control groups.
RESULTS: Significantly lower alpha-diversity indexes were observed in IBS patients by random effects model. Twenty-six bacterial genera and twelve predicted pathways were identified with significant odds ratios and classification potentials for IBS patients. Based on these feature, we used transfer learning to enhance the predictive capabilities of our model, which improved model performance by approximately 10%. Moreover, through correlation network analysis, we found that Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae were negatively correlated with vitamin B6 metabolism, which was decreased in the patients with IBS. Ruminococcaceae was also negatively correlated with tyrosine metabolism, which was decreased in the patients with IBS.
DISCUSSION: This study revealed the dysbiosis of fecal bacterial diversity, composition, and predicted pathways of patients with IBS by meta-analysis and identified universal biomarkers for IBS prediction and therapeutic targets.",Li X; Li X; Xiao H; Xu J; He J; Xiao C; Zhang B; Cao M; Hong W,2024,Frontiers in microbiology,15,,1492349,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1492349,"Li, X., Li, X., Xiao, H., Xu, J., He, J., Xiao, C., Zhang, B., Cao, M., & Hong, W.

34023477,Irritable bowel syndrome in inflammatory bowel disease. Synergy in alterations of the gut-brain axis?,"The presence of digestive symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission is a topic of growing interest. Although there is heterogeneity in clinical studies regarding the use of IBD remission criteria and the diagnosis of IBS, the available data indicate that the IBD-IBS overlap would affect up to one third of patients in remission, and they agree on the finding of a negative impact on the mental health and quality of life of the individuals who suffer from it. The pathophysiological bases that would explain this potential overlap are not completely elucidated; however, an alteration in the gut-brain axis associated with an increase in intestinal permeability, neuroimmune activation and dysbiosis would be common to both conditions. The hypothesis of a new clinical entity or syndrome of ""Irritable Inflammatory Bowel Disease"" or ""Post-inflammatory IBS"" is the subject of intense investigation. The clinical approach is based on certifying the remission of IBD activity and ruling out other non-inflammatory causes of potentially treatable persistent functional digestive symptoms.

While traditionally considered to be commensal bacteria, there are scattered case reports and case series of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in CS and reports of colonic polyps with adherent spirochetes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the association between CS and GI symptoms and conditions including the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and colonic polyps. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed using specific keywords for CS and GI disease.

40179285,Gut-Directed Hypnotherapy for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, but prior studies have been small with variable delivery modalities. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the efficacy of gut-directed hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the impact of delivery characteristics.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Titles and abstracts, then full text articles, were screened for inclusion criteria. Studies were extracted and assessed for bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of gut-directed hypnotherapy on global IBS symptoms and pain. A sub-group analysis was conducted to assess the impact of gut-directed hypnotherapy delivery characteristics on IBS-related outcomes.
RESULTS: Twelve studies in 11 papers met inclusion criteria, involving 1158 patients with IBS. Eight studies provided continuous measures sufficient for meta-analysis. On systematic review, all 12 studies found gut-directed hypnotherapy to be superior to the comparator; nine were statistically significant. On meta-analysis, gut-directed hypnotherapy improved global IBS symptoms (SMD 0.73 [-0.09-1.55], I2 93%). Gut-directed hypnotherapy with high-volume delivery and gut-directed hypnotherapy delivered in groups showed statistically significant improvement in global IBS symptoms (SMD 0.56 [0.29-0.83], I2 0%; SMD 0.41 [0.05-0.77], I2 61%). Gut-directed hypnotherapy also significantly improved pain more than its comparator groups (SMD 0.25 [0.01-0.49], I2 17%).
CONCLUSION: Gut-directed hypnotherapy may improve global symptoms of IBS. In particular, GDH improved pain symptoms compared to other standard IBS interventions. GDH delivered in groups was effective at reducing global IBS symptoms compared to standard interventions.",Adler EC; Levine EH; Ibarra AN; Boparai ES; Hung YY; McCrary QD; Lee JK,2025,Neurogastroenterology and motility,37,7,e70037,10.1111/nmo.70037,"Adler, E.

In patients with IBDs, both the disease itself and its treatment can affect the vaccine response.
METHODS: Medical databases were searched for relevant studies and statistical analysis was performed. As a result, 20 publications were included in the study, 9 of which met the criteria for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The immune response to vaccination was better in healthy subjects (odds ratio = 0.73, 95% confidence interval = 0.45-1.17) and patients without immunosuppressive treatment (odds ratio = 0.65, 95% confidence interval = 0.41-1.03), but did not reach statistical significance.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.
RESULTS: 12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative colitis (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α-Linolenic acid (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62).

34490319,A Low-FODMAP Diet Improves the Global Symptoms and Bowel Habits of Adult IBS Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: A low-fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet has been reported to be associated with improving the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, its efficacy as evaluated by different studies remains controversial. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to explore the efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) in alleviating the symptoms of IBS. Methods: A search of the literature for RCTs that assessed the efficacy of an LFD in treating IBS patients was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. The searches in each database were conducted from the inception of the database to February 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations and a third reviewer resolved disagreements. Two independent reviewers also performed eligibility assessments and data extraction. The RCTs that evaluated LFDs vs. a normal IBS or usual diet and assessed changes of IBS symptoms were included in the search. Data were synthesized as the relative risk of global symptoms improvement, mean difference of IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) score, sub-items of IBS-SSS irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life (IBS-QOL), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), stool consistency/frequency, and body mass index (BMI) using a random effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2). The bias of publication was assessed based on Egger's regression analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results: A total of 2,768 citations were identified. After full-text screening, a total of 10 studies were eligible for the systematic review and were subsequently used to compare an LFD with various control interventions in 511 participants. An LFD was associated with the improvement of global symptoms [n = 420; Risk Ratio (RR) = 1.54; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.18 to 2; I 2 = 38%], improvement of stool consistency [n = 434; Mean difference (MD) = -0.25; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.06; I 2= 19%), and a reduction trend of stool frequency (n = 434; MD = -0.28; 95% CI -0.57 to 0.01; I 2 = 68%) compared with control interventions. There was no statistically significant change in IBS-QOL (n = 484; MD = 2.77; 95% CI -2 to 7.55; I 2 = 62%), anxiety score (n = 150; MD = -0.45; 95% CI -3.38 to 2.49; I 2 = 86%), depression score (n = 150; MD = -0.05; 95% CI -2.5 to 2.4; I 2 = 88%), and BMI (n = 110; MD = -0.22; 95% CI -1.89 to 1.45; I 2 = 14%). The overall quality of the data was ""moderate"" for ""global improvement of IBS symptom,"" ""stool consistency,"" ""stool consistency for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D),"" and ""stool frequency for IBS-D,"" and ""low"" or ""very low"" for other outcomes according to GRADE criteria.

37222050,Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) negatively affect the quality of life. Some previous studies found that H. pylori infection should be positively associated with the risk of IBS, but others did not. The present study aims to clarify this association, and to further analyse whether H. pylori treatment can improve IBS symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal and Wanfang databases were searched. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model. The pooled odds ratios (ORs)/risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% CIs were calculated. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics. Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Thirty-one studies with 21 867 individuals were included. Meta-analysis of 27 studies found that patients with IBS had a significantly higher risk of H. pylori infection than those without (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.18; p < 0.001). The heterogeneity was statistically significant (I2 = 85%; p < 0.001). Meta-regression analyses indicated that study design and diagnostic criteria of IBS might be the potential sources of heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of eight studies demonstrated that H. pylori eradication treatment had a higher improvement rate of IBS symptoms (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39; p < 0.001). The heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 32%; p = 0.170). Meta-analysis of four studies also demonstrated that successful H. pylori eradication had a higher improvement rate of IBS symptoms (RR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.53; p = 0.040). The heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 1%; p = 0.390).

33227554,Adults living with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): A qualitative systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: To consolidate existing qualitative studies which examined the experiences and needs of adults living with IBS, and to gather a holistic insight for future directions and avenues to support these adults.
METHODS: A qualitative systematic review was conducted and six databases were searched for qualitative studies, beginning from each database's inception to July 2020. The qualitative data were meta-synthesised and thematic analysis was adopted. Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached throughout the process of data screening, selection, critical appraisal and synthesis.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies with a total of 299 adults diagnosed with IBS were included. Four themes were identified: (1) physical, psychological, and social consequences; (2) impact of IBS on working adults; (3) dealing with IBS; and (4) sources of support and support needs.
CONCLUSION: Future research across geographically diverse locations are needed to gather a thorough perspective of the experiences and needs of adults living with IBS. The development and evaluation of technology-based, trained peer-led volunteers, and interventions that adopt mindfulness, active coping strategies, cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance, and commitment therapy are needed.

40333172,"Association between inflammatory bowel disease, current therapies, and cardiovascular events: a review and meta-analysis of data from 2.2 million individuals.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Advanced therapies that treat IBD may modify this risk. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the association between IBD, its subtypes (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and its therapies, with CV disease.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from January 2000 to November 2023. Studies examining the relationship between IBD and the CV outcomes of incident myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were included. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Incidence rate differences for MACE were derived from studies comparing IBD therapies.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies evaluating CV outcomes were included. Of the 2 232 375 individuals, 10.8% were IBD patients, mean age was 47.3 years, and 48.4% were male. Inflammatory bowel disease was significantly associated with MI (HR 1.29, 95% CI, 1.07-1.56, I2 = 0.87), IHD (HR 1.16, 95% CI, 1.01-1.33, I2 = 0.60), CVA (HR 1.15, 95% CI, 1.09-1.20, I2 = 0.30), and MACE (HR 1.19, 95% CI, 1.09-1.30, I2 = 0.81). Incidence rate differences (events per 1000 patient-years) for MACE, calculated for 16 comparative studies, ranged from 90.3 fewer events in tofacitinib compared with placebo to an excess of 17.9 events in a vedolizumab group compared with anti-TNFα biologics.

32008157,The association between irritable bowel syndrome and osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could be a risk factor for osteoporosis although the evidence is still limited. The current study aimed to comprehensively examine the risk of osteoporosis among patients with IBS using systematic review and meta-analysis technique.
METHODOLOGY: Literature search was independently conducted by two investigators using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar database up to October 2019. Eligible study must evaluate whether patients with IBS have a higher risk of osteoporosis and/or osteoporotic fracture. It could be either cross-sectional study, case-control study, or cohort study. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
RESULTS: Of the 320 articles identified from the three databases, four cohort and one cross-sectional study with 526,633 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. All five studies investigated the risk of osteoporosis among patients with IBS, and the pooled analysis found that patients with IBS had a significantly higher risk of osteoporosis than individuals without IBS with the pooled risk ratio of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.04-3.64; I2 100%). Sensitivity analysis including only cohort studies found a lower RR (pooled RR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.39-1.72) with a lower I2 (59%). Three studies investigated the risk of osteoporotic fracture, and the pooled analysis found that patients with IBS also had a higher risk of osteoporotic fracture than individuals without IBS with the pooled risk ratio of 1.58 although statistical significance was not reached (95% CI, 0.95-2.62; I2 99%). Sensitivity analysis including only cohort studies found a lower RR (pooled RR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20-1.39) with a dramatically lower I2 (0%). Limitations included high heterogeneity and reliance on diagnostic codes.
CONCLUSION: A significantly increased risk of osteoporosis among IBS patients was observed in this study.

The present study aimed to investigate the genetic association by conducting a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted through Wiley Online Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and PubMed databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to investigate the associations between rs4613763 T/C, 17234657T/G polymorphisms, and IBD risk in Caucasian.
RESULTS: Twenty case-control studies consisting of 18,495 Crohn disease (CD) patients and 4203 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, as well as 26,063 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The rs4613763T/C polymorphism had obvious influence on CD, UC risk in Caucasian. However, rs17234657T/G polymorphism had obvious influence on CD but not UC in Caucasian.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that both the rs4613763 T/C, rs17234657T/G polymorphisms had obvious influence on risk of CD in Caucasian.

This study aimed to comprehensively compare the prevalence of IBS among migraineurs versus nonmigraineurs using the systematic review and the meta-analysis technique.
METHODS: Two authors independently conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar database up to April 2020. The eligible study must consist of two groups of participants, migraineurs and nonmigraineurs, and report the prevalence of IBS in both groups. Alternatively, an eligible study may report the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between migraine and IBS. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
RESULTS: Of the 2531 articles identified from the three databases, 11 studies with a total of 28 336 migraineurs and 1 535 758 nonmigraineurs met the selection criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis found that migraineurs had a significantly higher prevalence of IBS than nonmigraineurs with the pooled OR of 2.49 (95% CI, 2.22-2.78; I2, 42%).

Trials investigating the effects of internet-based telerehabilitation in any musculoskeletal disorder were selected. Nonoriginal articles and grey literature were excluded. Two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction. Random effect meta-analyses (standardized mean difference) and further sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: We selected 37 clinical trials (33 randomized and 4 non-randomized) and 5 health economics studies, which included a total of 4,288 participants. Telerehabilitation was more favourable than control treatments in improving all studied clinical outcomes, although the effectiveness varied depending on the type of musculoskeletal disorder. The standard mean differences (SMD) ranged from 0.24 to 0.91. For physical function, the primary outcome, superior effectiveness was found only in people with hip fractures (SMD, 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.34 to 1.41). The effects for joint replacement, osteoarthritis, and spine pain were similar to those of control treatments. However, the favourable outcomes for telerehabilitation became insignificant when compared specifically to face-to-face rehabilitation. Some results displayed publication bias and a lack of robustness, necessitating cautious interpretation. In terms of health economics studies, telerehabilitation was 89.55$ (95 % CI 4.6 to 174.5) cheaper per individual than conventional treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Telerehabilitation should be considered in the recovery process of musculoskeletal disorders when optimal face-to-face rehabilitation is not feasible. Moreover, telerehabilitation reduces costs and time.

32738908,Assessment of causal link between psychological factors and symptom exacerbation in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review utilising Bradford Hill criteria and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND: Psychological stress is a prevalent factor in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with detrimental effects on patients' quality of life and possibly disease course. Although the aetiology of symptom exacerbation in IBD has been explored, determining any causation between psychological stress and symptom worsening remains challenging and requires a methodologically rigorous approach.
AIM: The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to determine a causal relationship between psychological stress and symptom exacerbation in IBD, subsequently utilising Bradford Hill's criteria (approach never used in this topic area before) to evaluate the likelihood of causal associations.
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies up to July 20, 2019. Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by two independent reviewers. Results of all retained papers were presented as a narrative synthesis. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted on studies meeting the criteria for meta-analysis. Bradford Hill criteria were applied to assess the causality of the relationship between all psychological factors and symptom exacerbation.
RESULTS: The searches yielded 2472 potential articles. Nineteen clinical prospective cohort studies were eligible for the narrative review with five suitable for the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed depression, anxiety and perceived stress did not have a statistically significant association with an increased risk of symptom exacerbation. Four of the Bradford Hill criteria were met which indicates that there is weak to moderate evidence of a causal association between all the psychological factors and disease activity. Inconsistent results and a dearth of studies using the same tools for measuring psychological factors suggest the need for more research to be done to facilitate more conclusive findings.
CONCLUSIONS: This original review utilising Bradford Hill criteria in addition to meta-analysis to evaluate the causality of relationship between psychological factors and symptom exacerbation in IBD provides evidence that psychological factors have a weak to moderate causal involvement in IBD symptom exacerbation. However, when combining this finding with the outcomes of the meta-analysis, we can say that the results were inconclusive. Interventions to reduce the associated psychological impact should be part of the treatment plan for patients with IBD.

33331483,Systematic review with meta-analysis: lubiprostone efficacy on the treatment of patients with constipation.,"BACKGROUND: Lubiprostone is a type 2 chloride channel activator that has been shown to be efficacious and safe in the treatment for chronic constipation.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of lubiprostone for patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation (IBS-C) and opioid-induced constipation (OIC).
METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane Collaboration Database, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Lubiprostone RCTs reporting outcomes of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) and abdominal pain or discomfort were deemed eligible. Meta-analysis was performed calculating risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals, using the Mantel-Haenszel method and random effects model.
RESULTS: Searches yielded 109 records representing 93 non-duplicate publications, and 11 RCTs (978 CIC, 1,366 IBS-C, 1,300 OIC, total = 3,644) met inclusion criteria. Qualitative synthesis showed that for CIC patients, lubiprostone is superior to placebo in terms of SBM outcomes. Meta-analysis for CIC was feasible for full responder and SBM within 24h rates, indicating superiority of lubiprostone over placebo. For IBS-C, lubiprostone was significantly superior for all SBM outcomes in follow-ups ranging from 1 week-3 months. In terms of abdominal pain, lubiprostone provided significantly better symptoms relief, particularly after 1 month of treatment. For OIC, lubiprostone was more effective than placebo for both SBM and discomfort measures.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that lubiprostone is superior to placebo in terms of SBM frequency for CIC, IBS-C and OIC. In terms of abdominal symptoms, the most pronounced effect was seen for abdominal pain in IBS-C patients.",Passos MDCF; Takemoto MLS; Corradino GC; Guedes LS,2020,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,57,4,498-506,10.1590/S0004-2803.202000000-83,"Passos, M.

32780094,Prevalence of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant public health burden, with up to 30% of the US population affected. The prevalence of NAFLD among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is unknown. Understanding risk factors for NAFLD in IBD patients has implications in the treatment of these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients and to identify risk factors associated with NAFLD development.
METHODS: Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched using Medical Subject Headlines to find studies that assessed the prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients. Twenty-seven English-language research abstracts/articles were identified between January 2005 and April 2018. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models. Prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients was compared with prevalence of NAFLD in the general population.
RESULTS: Based on data pooled from all 27 studies, the prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients was 32% (95% CI, 24%-40%) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 98%). The prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients (32%) is statistically significantly higher than the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population (25.2%; P < 0.001). Factors associated with the development of NAFLD among IBD patients included age, BMI, diabetes, IBD duration, and prior history of bowel resection.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher prevalence of NAFLD among IBD patients compared with the general population. Previous treatment regimens may be a risk factor for the development of NAFLD. Future studies are needed to further clarify these risk factors and determine screening recommendations.",Lin A; Roth H; Anyane-Yeboa A; Rubin DT; Paul S,2021,Inflammatory bowel diseases,27,6,947-955,10.1093/ibd/izaa189,"Lin, A., Roth, H., Anyane-Yeboa, A., Rubin, D.

38762503,Medical radiation exposure in inflammatory bowel disease: an updated meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There have been previous studies and earlier systematic review on the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and radiation exposure. With the diversification of current test methods, this study intended to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the IBD radiation exposure in recent years.
METHODS: Three databases (PUBMED, EMBASE, and MEDICINE) for relevant literature up to May 1, 2023 were searched. The statistical data meeting requirements were collated and extracted.
RESULTS: 20 papers were enrolled. The overall high radiation exposure rate was 15% (95% CI = [12%, 19%]) for CD and 5% (95% CI = [3%, 7%]) for UC. The pooled result found that high radiation exposure rate was 3.44 times higher in CD than in UC (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = [2.35, 5.02]). Moreover, the average radiation exposure level in CD was 12.77 mSv higher than that in UC (WMD = 12.77, 95% CI = [9.93, 15.62] mSv). Furthermore, radiation exposure level of CD after 2012 was higher than those before 2012 (26.42 ± 39.61vs. 23.76 ± 38.46 mSv, P = 0.016), while UC did not show similar result (11.99 ± 27.66 vs. 10.01 ± 30.76 mSv, P = 0.1). Through subgroup analysis, it was found that disease duration (WMD = 2.75, 95% CI = [0.10, 5.40] mSv), complications (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = [1.50, 17.29]), and surgical history (OR = 5.46, 95% CI = [1.51, 19.69]) significantly increased the proportion of high radiation exposure.
CONCLUSION: This study found that radiation exposure level of IBD patients was high, which revealed the radiation risk in the process of diagnosis and treatment of IBD patients. In the future, longer follow-up and prospective studies are needed to reveal the relationship between high radiation exposure and solid tumorigenesis.",Lu C; Yao X; Yu M; He X,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,173,10.1186/s12876-024-03264-1,"Lu, C., Yao, X., Yu, M., & He, X.

34190027,Methane positive small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several studies reported a potential role of methane producing archaea in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of methane positive small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in IBS and IBD compared with controls. MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase electronic databases were searched from inception until March 2021 for case-control and prevalence studies reporting SIBO in IBS and IBD. We extracted data from published studies and calculated pooled prevalence of SIBO in IBS or IBD, odds ratios (OR), and 95% CIs, utilizing a random effects model. The final dataset included 17 independent studies assessing the prevalence of methane positive SIBO in 1,653 IBS-patients and 713 controls, and 7 studies assessing the prevalence of methane positive SIBO in 626 IBD-patients and 497 controls, all utilizing breath test for SIBO diagnosis. Prevalence of methane positive SIBO in IBS and IBD was 25.0% (95% CI 18.8-32.4) and 5.6% (95% CI 2.6-11.8), respectively. Methane positive SIBO in IBS was not increased compared to controls (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.7, P = .37) but was significantly more prevalent in IBS-C as compared to IBS-D (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.6, P = .0001). The prevalence of methane-positive SIBO in patients with IBD was 3-fold lower at 7.4% (95% CI 5.4-9.8) compared to 23.5% (95% CI 19.8-27.5) in controls. The prevalence of methane positive SIBO was significantly lower in Crohn's disease as compared to ulcerative colitis, (5.3%, 95% CI 3.0-8.5 vs. 20.2%, 95% CI 12.8-29.4). This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests methane positivity on breath testing is positively associated with IBS-C and inversely with IBD. However, the quality of evidence is low largely due to clinical heterogeneity of the studies. Thus, causality is uncertain and further studies are required.",Gandhi A; Shah A; Jones MP; Koloski N; Talley NJ; Morrison M; Holtmann G,2021,Gut microbes,13,1,1933313,10.1080/19490976.2021.1933313,"Gandhi, A., Shah, A., Jones, M.

33508441,"Systematic review, meta-analysis with subgroup analysis of hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome, effect of intervention characteristics.","BACKGROUND: Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective at relieving global gastrointestinal symptoms (GGS) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This study examines the impact of hypnotherapy delivery and participant characteristics on IBS outcomes.
METHODS: This systematic review searched CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Conference Citation Index, Embase, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsychINFO, Science Citation index-expanded, Social Science Citation Index. Titles and abstracts, then full-text articles were screened against inclusion criteria: trials with a concurrent comparator of hypnotherapy in adults with IBS diagnosed using Manning or ROME criteria, which provided symptom data. Included studies were extracted and assessed for bias using Cochrane Collaboration 2011 guidance. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with sub-group analysis to assess the impact of delivery characteristics on outcomes.
RESULTS: Twelve trials were included, 7 in the meta-analyses. Hypnotherapy reduced the risk of GGS, but this was not statistically significant, (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.24, [-0.06, 0.54], I2 66 %). Higher frequency of sessions (≥1/week) reduced GGS (SMD 0.45 [0.23,0.67] I2 0 %), as did higher volumes of intervention (≥8 sessions with ≥6 h of contact) (SMD 0.51 [0.27,0.76] I2 0 %) and group interventions (SMD 0.45 [0.03, 0.88] I2 62 %). Only volume of intervention produced a significant effect between the subgroups.
CONCLUSION: This review suggests that high volume hypnotherapy is more beneficial than low and should be adopted for GDH. Both high frequency and group interventions are effective in reducing GGS in IBS. However, the sample size is small and more studies are needed to confirm this.",Krouwel M; Farley A; Greenfield S; Ismail T; Jolly K,2021,Complementary therapies in medicine,57,,102672,10.1016/j.ctim.2021.102672,"Krouwel, M., Farley, A., Greenfield, S., Ismail, T., & Jolly, K.

38972436,Additional Yield of Random Biopsy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There are limited clinical data regarding the additional yields of random biopsies (RBs) during colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. To assess the additional yield of RB, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating the preferred colonoscopy surveillance approach for inflammatory bowel disease patients. The additional yield, detection rate, procedure time, and withdrawal time were pooled.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies (48 arms) were included in the meta-analysis with 9051 patients. The additional yields of RB were 10.34% in per-patient analysis and 16.20% in per-lesion analysis. The detection rates were 1.31% and 2.82% in per-patient and per-lesion analysis, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed a decline in additional yields from 14.43% to 0.42% in the per-patient analysis and from 19.20% to 5.32% in the per-lesion analysis for studies initiated before and after 2011. In per-patient analysis, the additional yields were 4.83%, 10.29%, and 56.05% for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) proportions of 0% to 10%, 10% to 30%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding detection rates were 0.56%, 1.40%, and 19.45%. In the per-lesion analysis, additional yields were 11.23%, 21.06%, and 45.22% for PSC proportions of 0% to 10%, 10% to 30%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding detection rates were 2.09%, 3.58%, and 16.24%.
CONCLUSIONS: The additional yields of RB were 10.34% and 16.20% for per-patient and per-lesion analyses, respectively.

Asan external therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), moxibustion is usually used to treat IBS-D. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of moxibustion in treating patients with IBS-D.
METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the use of moxibustion in IBS-D treatment was performed in eight databases.
RESULTS: Eleven RCTs including 725 participants meet the inclusion criteria. Compared with other positive treatments (Western medicine, TCM prescription, and acupuncture), moxibustion treatment had superior effects against IBS-D according to the meta-analysis.

32317962,Efficacy and Safety of Probiotics in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disease. Evidence has suggested that probiotics may benefit IBS symptoms. However, clinical trials remain conflicting.
AIMS: To implement a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials regarding the efficacy and safety of probiotics for IBS patients.
METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in Medline(1966 to Jan 2019), Embase(1974 to Jan 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(up to Jan 2019), the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register(up to Jan 2019), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database(1978 to Jan 2019). Risk ratio (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were calculated for continuous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 59 studies, including 6,761 patients, were obtained. The RR of the improvement or response with probiotics versus placebo was 1.52 (95% CI 1.32-1.76), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 71%, P < 0.001). The SMD of Probiotics in improving global IBS symptoms vs. Placebo was -1.8(95% CI -0.30 to -0.06), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 65%, P < 0.001). It was impossible to draw a determinate conclusion. However, there were differences in subgroup analyses of probiotics type, dose, treatment duration, and geographic position. Probiotics seem to be safe by the analysis of adverse events(RR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.92-1.24; I2 = 0, P = 0.83).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective and safe for IBS patients. Single probiotics with a higher dose (daily dose of probiotics ≥1010) and shorter duration (< 8 weeks) seem to be a better choice, but it still needs more trials to prove it.",Li B; Liang L; Deng H; Guo J; Shu H; Zhang L,2020,Frontiers in pharmacology,11,,332,10.3389/fphar.2020.00332,"Li, B., Liang, L., Deng, H., Guo, J., Shu, H., & Zhang, L.

38915086,"Impact of sex and socioeconomic status on the likelihood of surgery, hospitalization, and use of medications in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are associated with high healthcare utilization. This systematic review aimed to summarize what is known about the impact of sex, income, and education on the likelihood of bowel surgery, hospitalization, and use of corticosteroids and biologics among patients with IBD.
METHODS: We used EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science to perform a systematic literature search. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis for the impact of sex on the likelihood of surgery and hospitalization. In addition, we performed subgroup analyses of the effect of IBD type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and age. Finally, meta-regression was undertaken for the year of publication.
RESULTS: In total, 67 studies were included, of which 23 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. In the main meta-analysis, male sex was associated with an increased likelihood of bowel surgery (HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.13;1.78), which was consistent with the subgroup analysis for UC only (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.16; 2.72). Sex did not impact the likelihood of hospitalization (OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.86;1.30), although the subgroup analysis revealed an increased likelihood of hospitalization in CD patients (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28;1.58). In 9 of 10 studies, no significant sex-based differences in the use of biologics were reported, although in 6 of 6 studies, female patients had lower adherence to biologics. In 11 of 13 studies, no significant sex-based difference in the use of corticosteroids was reported. The evidence of the impact of income and education on healthcare utilization was sparse and pointed in different directions. The substantial heterogeneity between studies was explained, in part, by differences in IBD type and age.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review indicate that male patients with IBD are significantly more likely to have surgery than female patients with IBD but are not, overall, more likely to be hospitalized, whereas female patients appear to have statistically significantly lower adherence to biologics compared to male patients. Thus, clinicians should not underestimate the impact of sex on healthcare utilization. Evidence for income- and education-based differences remains sparse.

36013502,Helicobacterpylori Infection-A Risk Factor for Irritable Bowel Syndrome? An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"UNLABELLED: Nowadays, the relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection (HPI) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between HPI and IBS through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 August 2021. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the association between HPI and IBS. Subgroup analyses were conducted for further assessment and exploration of heterogeneity sources. In addition, we assessed publication bias through funnel plots, Egger's test, and Begg's test. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 13,173 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the association between HPI and IBS was 1.03 (95% CI [0.80,1.31]; p = 0.84). The adjusted OR of the association between HPI and IBS after excluding the studies with confounding factors defined by our team was 1.29 (95% CI [1.03,1.62]; p = 0.03). We found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D (diarrhea subtype) (OR: 1.54; 95% CI [1.22,1.95]; p = 0.0003). The OR of the relationship between cytotoxin-associated gene A (Cag A) positive HPI and IBS was 4.3 (95% CI [0.51,36.17]; p = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of HPI in IBS patients is relatively higher than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant, implying that HPI is not significantly associated with IBS, albeit we may underestimate this association. Moreover, we found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D. We also observed an increased likelihood of Cag-A positive HPI in IBS patients than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant.",Wang Z; Liu Y; Peng Y; Peng L,2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",58,8,,10.3390/medicina58081035,"Wang, Z., Liu, Y., Peng, Y., & Peng, L.

32530987,Pharmacologic Treatments for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: an Umbrella Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Multiple pharmacologic treatments are available for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and a large body of evidence has been presented. However, the strength and credibility of the evidence have not been comprehensively evaluated. We aimed to review the systematic reviews and meta- analyses of pharmacologic treatments for IBS and evaluate the credibility of the findings.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library from inception to September 2019 for systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for IBS. We summarized relative ratios (RR), evaluated the credibility of the evidence and classified the evidence into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, and weak.
RESULTS: We included 11 systematic reviews with 40 meta-analyses (330 randomized controlled trials and 86,459 participants) assessing 10 treatment categories and 2 drugs. Most of the pharmacologic treatments were significantly superior over placebo as reported by the included meta-analyses. The evidence for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 antagonists (RR=1.56, 95%CI: 1.43-1.71), antispasmodics (RR=1.19, 95%CI: 1.02-1.39), and alosetron (RR=1.46, 95%CI: 1.26-1.71) were highly suggestive for relieving global IBS symptoms. 5-HT4 agonists (RR= 1.26, 95%CI: 1.19-1.34) and guanylate cyclase-C (GCC) agonists (RR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.54-1.95) were found to give convincing evidence for the improvement of the responder rate. 5-HT3 antagonists (RR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.26-1.38) offered convincing evidence for relieving abdominal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT4 agonists and GCC agonists, antispasmodics, and alosetron were suggestive for the treatment of IBS. However, owing to the risk of bias in randomization methods, the results for GCC should be interpreted with caution.",Chen M; Tang TC; Qin D; Yue L; Zheng H,2020,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,29,2,199-209,10.15403/jgld-817,"Chen, M., Tang, T.

39367676,Review article: The role of the gut-brain axis in inflammatory bowel disease and its therapeutic implications.,"BACKGROUND: Treatments targeting the gut-brain axis (GBA) are effective at reducing symptom burden in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The prevalence of common mental disorders and IBS-type symptom reporting is significantly higher in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than would be expected, suggesting potential GBA effects in this setting. Manipulation of the GBA may offer novel treatment strategies in selected patients with IBD. We present a narrative review of the bi-directional effects of the GBA in IBD and explore the potential for GBA-targeted therapies in this setting.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant articles published by March 2024.
RESULTS: The bi-directional relationship between psychological well-being and adverse longitudinal disease activity outcomes, and the high prevalence of IBS-type symptom reporting highlight the presence of GBA-mediated effects in IBD. Treatments targeting gut-brain interactions including brain-gut behavioural treatments, neuromodulators, and dietary interventions appear to be useful adjunctive treatments in a subset of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological morbidity is prevalent in patients with IBD. The relationship between longitudinal disease activity outcomes, IBS-type symptom reporting, and poor psychological health is mediated via the GBA. Proactive management of psychological health should be integrated into routine care. Further clinical trials of GBA-targeted therapies, conducted in selected groups of patients with co-existent common mental disorders, or those who report IBS-type symptoms, are required to inform effective integrated models of care in the future.",Riggott C; Ford AC; Gracie DJ,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,60,9,1200-1214,10.1111/apt.18192,"Riggott, C., Ford, A.

39285826,A systematic review of yoga for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reviewed yoga for the treatment of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) with most demonstrating a benefit for symptom reduction; however, yoga has been studied beyond DGBI.
PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive summary of yoga as treatment for gastrointestinal conditions.
METHOD: We conducted literature searches in PubMed and Embase and included yoga trials of adults with a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorders and diseases.
RESULTS: We identified 1275 articles; 12 studies were eligible. Most studies compared yoga to controls, for patients with different GI conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, chronic pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal cancer). The type, method, and duration of yoga used varied. Across IBS studies, most demonstrated that yoga improved IBS symptom severity, mood-related symptoms, and quality of life compared with controls. In one study of inflammatory bowel disease, yoga improved quality of life compared to controls. Two studies of gastrointestinal cancer demonstrated that yoga led to a reduction in sleep disturbance and mood symptoms. One study of chronic pancreatitis found that yoga led to improvements in quality of life, stress, mood changes, alcohol dependence, and appetite. Yoga was generally safe, and no serious adverse events were attributed to the intervention.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, yoga appears to be safe and has potential to improve functioning across a spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases; however, current studies are limited by heterogeneity and methodological weaknesses. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of yoga on health outcomes for a broader range of gastrointestinal conditions.",Thakur ER; Shapiro JM; Wellington J; Sohl SJ; Danhauer SC; Moshiree B; Ford AC; Koch K,2024,Neurogastroenterology and motility,,,e14915,10.1111/nmo.14915,"Thakur, E.

32487960,Health-Related Quality of Life in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 20% of the global population and is associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate differences in HRQoL of those with IBS compared with healthy controls and to examine whether HRQoL improves following psychological intervention. Online databases were searched for articles from 2002 to 2017. Studies were screened and data extracted according to predetermined criteria. A total of 4,154 citations were identified from which 36 were eligible for inclusion. Eight studies compared HRQoL of those with IBS (n = 822) with that of healthy individuals (n = 3,809). Those with IBS suffered significant impairment across all HRQoL domains compared with healthy individuals, with the majority of effects (Cohen's d) being moderate to large. Twenty-eight studies investigated HRQoL in IBS following psychological intervention (n = 1,308) relative to controls (n = 1,006). All HRQoL domains improved with large effects following treatment; however, maintenance of these effects was inconsistent. Those with IBS experience poorer HRQoL than the wider community; nevertheless, psychological interventions are associated with improved HRQoL across all domains. High-quality studies are needed to better inform gastroenterological nurses of which interventions are most efficacious in alleviating the burden of IBS, and which IBS subpopulations would benefit.",Cassar GE; Youssef GJ; Knowles S; Moulding R; Austin DW,2020,Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates,43,3,E102-E122,10.1097/SGA.0000000000000530,"Cassar, G.

37725328,Hypertension in oral lichen planus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the prevalence and magnitude of the association of hypertension in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published before May 2022, not restricted by publication language or date. The methodological quality and risk of bias of primary-level studies were critically assessed. Meta-analyses were performed, as well as meta-regression, stratified, sensitivity and small-study effects analyses, a Galbraith (radial) plot, and trial sequential analysis. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE system.
RESULTS: 104 studies, including 16,587 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The results show that patients who suffer from OLP have a high prevalence of hypertension (PP = 24.17%, 95% CI = 21.45-27.00), with a low quality of evidence. A significant association between hypertension and oral lichen planus was also reported (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.63, p = 0.04), showing a moderate quality of evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OLP could be at an increased risk of suffering from hypertension which is probably due to multiple factors. Healthcare practitioners involved in OLP management should be aware of this comorbidity in order to apply suitable measures and make referrals if hypertension is suspected, although further research is needed.",De Porras-Carrique T; Ramos-García P; González-Moles MÁ,2024,Oral diseases,30,4,1793-1805,10.1111/odi.14727,"De Porras-Carrique, T., Ramos-García, P., & González-Moles, M.

37233510,Efficacy and Security of Tetrodotoxin in the Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pharmacological treatment of cancer-related pain is unsatisfactory. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) has shown analgesia in preclinical models and clinical trials, but its clinical efficacy and safety have not been quantified. For this reason, our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical evidence that was available. A systematic literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 1 March 2023 in order to identify published clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and security of TTX in patients with cancer-related pain, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Five articles were selected, three of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The number of responders to the primary outcome (≥30% improvement in the mean pain intensity) and those suffering adverse events in the intervention and placebo groups were used to calculate effect sizes using the log odds ratio. The meta-analysis showed that TTX significantly increased the number of responders (mean = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.19-1.16, p = 0.0065) and the number of patients suffering non-severe adverse events (mean = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.31-1.95, p = 0.0068). However, TTX did not increase the risk of suffering serious adverse events (mean = 0.75; 95% CI: -0.43-1.93, p = 0.2154). In conclusion, TTX showed robust analgesic efficacy but also increased the risk of suffering non-severe adverse events. These results should be confirmed in further clinical trials with higher numbers of patients.",Huerta MÁ; de la Nava J; Artacho-Cordón A; Nieto FR,2023,Marine drugs,21,5,,10.3390/md21050316,"Huerta, M.

40442599,Association between the immune-inflammation index and the severity and clinical outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Existing studies have explored the association between immune-inflammatory indices and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but there is a lack of comprehensive evidence. This meta-analysis and systematic review seeks to synthesize the data of available clinical research and offer the latest and comprehensive evidence-based conclusions regarding whether these immune-inflammatory indices can effectively predict the severity, activity, and prognosis of IBD.
METHODS: Seven databases were comprehensively retrieved from their establishment to March 23, 2025. The combined results were described through standardized mean differences (SMD) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Review Manager 5.4 and STATA 15.0 were leveraged for data analysis.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 35 studies involving 5,870 patients. The aggregated data revealed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 1.18, 95% CI:1.04 to 1.34; P = 0.001) (SMD = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.73 to 1.29, P < 0.001), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (SMD = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.74, P < 0.001), neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR) (OR = 1.20, 95% CI:1.08 to 1.32, P < 0.001), and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CRP/ALB) (OR = 1.50, 95% CI:1.38 to 1.65, P < 0.001) were potentially linked to disease activity in IBD patients. PLR (SMD = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.60 to 1.55, P < 0.001) showed potential associations with disease severity in IBD patients. Additionally, NLR (SMD = 0.43, 95%CI = 0.15 to 0.70, P = 0.002) and eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (ELR) (SMD = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.26 to 1.00, P < 0.001) had potential associations with endoscopic response in IBD patients. Moreover, NLR was potentially associated with disease relapse(OR = 1.35, 95% CI:1.09 to 1.68; P = 0.006) and steroid responsiveness (SMD = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.15 to 0.85, P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: NLR, PLR, NPR, and CRP/ALB are potential predictors of disease activity in IBD patients. PLR shows the potential to predict disease severity, while NLR and ELR are potential indicators of endoscopic response. Furthermore, NLR is also a potential predictor of relapse and steroid responsiveness. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support an association between NLR and the severity of IBD, whereas lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) appears to be associated with both the severity and activity of IBD and PLR and eosinophil*neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (ENLR) are associated with endoscopic response in IBD.

38789987,Epidemiologic profile of inflammatory bowel disease in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main types: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The epidemiology of IBD patients has not been comprehensively studied in EMRO countries; therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to study the epidemiology of this disease in these countries.
METHODS: We searched four international databases, namely Scopus, Web of Knowledge (ISI), Medline/PubMed, and ProQuest, from inception up to the end of May 2023. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was used to carry out this systematic review and meta-analysis investigation. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist, the quality of the selected papers was assessed.
RESULTS: Based on the results of this study, the incidence of UC in EMRO countries was 2.65 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.39-3.90), and the incidence of CD was 1.16 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.73-1.59). The most commonly involved intestinal segment in CD was the terminal ileum (44.7%, 95% CI: 34.7-55.2), followed by the ileum (29.8%, 95% CI: 22.2-38.6), and colon (18.7%, 95% CI: 10.8-30.4). However, in UC patients, extensive colitis was the most common finding (32.3%, 95% CI: 26.4-38.8), followed by proctosigmoiditis (27.9%, 95% CI: 21.1-35.8), left-sided colitis (27.4%, 95% CI: 22.7-32.7), and proctitis (22.6%, 95% CI: 17.5-28.5).
CONCLUSION: As a result, we were able to establish the traits of IBD patients in EMRO nations. UC patients had a higher incidence than CD patients. The most common regions of involvement in CD and UC patients, respectively, were the colon and pancolitis. Compared to UC patients, CD patients had a higher history of appendectomy.",Sanat ZM; Vahedi H; Malekzadeh R; Fanni Z,2024,BMC public health,24,1,1395,10.1186/s12889-024-18816-z,"Sanat, Z.

35879058,Efficacy of a Restrictive Diet in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dietary factors can aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many IBS patients try restrictive diets to relieve their symptoms, but the types of diets with an exacerbating factor are unknown. Therefore, this paper reports the results of a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) reviewing the efficacy of food restriction diets in IBS.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched until July 21, 2021, to retrieve RCTs assessing the efficacy of restriction diets in adults with IBS. Two independent reviewers performed the eligibility assessment and data abstraction. RCTs that evaluated a restriction diet versus a control diet and assessed the improvement in global IBS symptoms were included. These trials reported a dichotomous assessment of the overall response to therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 1,949 citations were identified. After full-text screening, 14 RCTs were considered eligible for the systematic review and network meta-analysis. A starch- and sucrose-reduced diet and a diet with low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) showed significantly better results than a usual diet. Symptom flare-ups in patients on a gluten- free diet were also significantly lower than in those on high-gluten diets.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that the starch- and sucrose-reduced, low FODMAP, and gluten-free diets had superior effects in reducing IBS symptoms. Further studies, including head-to-head trials will be needed to establish the effectiveness of dietary restrictions on IBS symptoms.",Yu SJ; Lee HS; Gung HJ; Kim JS; Kim KB; Kwon YH; Kim JH; Koo HS; Shin HD; Jee SR; Lee HB; Kim J; Park HW,2022,The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi,80,1,6-16,10.4166/kjg.2022.014,"Yu, S.

31898645,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional bowel disorder and the evidence shows most drug therapies in the treatment of IBS are weak. Recently, some studies showed probiotics may have a positive effect in IBS and they are widely used to improve the symptom of IBS, which indicate probiotics may play an important role in the treatment of IBS. However, the exact effectiveness and safety of probiotics are largely unknown. This systematic review focuses on identifying the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of IBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data sources were searched up to February 2019. Databases included MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics including complex or individual probiotics with placebo or no therapy were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of all RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias and Jadad scale. Outcomes included symptom-relevant and patient-relevant characteristics, such as symptom relief, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, quality of life, and adverse event.
RESULTS: This review includes 28 studies with a total of 3606 participants. Particular combinations of probiotics, or specific species and strains, showed probiotics have beneficial effect on overall IBS symptoms (22 studies, n = 3144, RR of improvement in overall IBS symptoms = 1.5, CI 1.23 to 1.83) or overall IBS symptom and abdominal pain scores (18 studies, n = 2766, SMD = -0.31, CI -0.45 to -0.17). In addition, adverse events were not significantly higher with probiotics (8 studies, n = 923, RR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.85-1.31). However, there was no significant benefit on individual IBS symptom scores and quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows particular combinations, species or strains of probiotics are effective for overall IBS symptoms. However, it is hard to derive a definite conclusion due to high heterogeneity and unclear risk of bias of some trials. Large well-designed and rigorous trials are warranted.",Sun JR; Kong CF; Qu XK; Deng C; Lou YN; Jia LQ,2020,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,26,2,66-77,10.4103/sjg.SJG_384_19,"Sun, J.

34942583,Emotional stress responsivity of patients with IBS - a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of the gut-brain interaction characterized by abdominal discomfort and pain associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of structural abnormalities. Chronic psychological stress is considered a risk factor for the development of IBS. The multifactorial pathogenesis involves complex interactions between biological, psychological and social factors, yet the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature from the databases MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to assess stress responsivity of patients with IBS in comparison to healthy individuals, specifically focusing acute psychological stressors.
RESULTS: A total of 37 case-control studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Findings comprised subjective changes in emotion (k = 18) and of gastrointestinal symptoms (k = 8) as well as objective parameters of gastrointestinal motility (k = 10), autonomic nervous system (k = 23), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (k = 11), functional brain activity (k = 7) and immune system (k = 3). Mental stress was found to increase IBS-specific symptomatology and alter gastrointestinal motility. Some patients with IBS showed stress-induced emotional hyperresponsivity and different patterns of neural activation. Autonomic and endocrine stress responses depend on the type of stressor and showed no clear evidence of differential reactivity, partly due to confounding factors. Data on acute immunological changes remains sparse and requires further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests altered stress reactivity in patients with IBS however, it remains unclear whether it can be attributed to the syndrome itself or the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities.",Schaper SJ; Stengel A,2022,Journal of psychosomatic research,153,,110694,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110694,"Schaper, S.

This study aimed to distinguish fatigue characteristics in IBS and IBD, two functional and organic disorders.
METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases from inception to June 30, 2023, and conducted a meta-analysis to generate precise estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The analyses were stratified by fatigue type, severity, sex, disease phase, and comorbidities, and study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
RESULTS: Our analysis included 74 data (13 IBS, 31 CD, 30 UC) encompassing 16,689 participants (6484 males, 7402 females, and 2803 unknown). Overall, fatigue prevalence trended higher in IBS (54.5% [95%CI, 44.5-64.6]), followed by CD (49.8% [95%CI, 44.0-55.5]) and UC (43.6% [95%CI, 38.5-48.7]). This pattern persisted across sub-analyses, including general fatigue (63.4% vs. 51.3% vs. 45.3%) and moderate to severe fatigue (73.8% vs. 59.5% vs. 52.7%) for IBS, CD, and UC, respectively. Female predominance was observed in all three diseases (odds ratio: 1.5 in IBS and CD, 1.8 in UC). Fatigue prevalence significantly varied between disease phases (active vs. remission) in CD (61.3% vs. 36.3%) and UC (53.8% vs. 32.6%). Anemia, anxiety/depression, and/or IBS-like symptoms also contributed to fatigue in CD and UC.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first extensive comparison of fatigue prevalence and features in IBS, CD, and UC. The findings offer valuable insights for treatment and management, aiding our understanding of functional and organic diseases.",Kim YJ; Lee SG; Lee JS; Choi YJ; Son CG,2024,Journal of psychosomatic research,177,,111589,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2024.111589,"Kim, Y.

35493361,The Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Among Chinese University Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has become a common public health issue among university students, impairing their physical and mental health. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the pooled prevalence of IBS and its associated factors among Chinese university students.
METHODS: Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE (via EBSCO), CINAHL (via EBSCO), Wan Fang, CNKI and Weipu (via VIP) were systematically searched from inception date to May 31, 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were used to detect the potential source of heterogeneity.
KEY RESULTS: A total of 22 cross-sectional studies (14 were in Chinese and 8 were in English) with 33,166 Chinese university students were included. The pooled prevalence of IBS was estimated as 11.89% (95% CI = 8.06%, 16.35%). The prevalence was 10.50% (95% CI = 6.80%, 15.87%) in Rome II criteria, 12.00% (95% CI = 8.23%, 17.17%) in Rome III criteria, and 3.66% (95% CI = 2.01%, 6.60%) in Rome IV criteria. The highest prevalence of IBS was 17.66% (95% CI = 7.37%, 36.64%) in North China, and the lowest was 3.18% (95% CI = 1.28%, 7.68%) in South China. Subgroup analyses indicated that gender, major, anxiety and depression symptoms, drinking and smoking behaviors were significantly associated with the prevalence of IBS. Meta-regression analyses suggested that region influenced prevalence estimates for IBS.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: This meta-analysis illustrated that IBS is very common in Chinese university students. Regular screening, effective prevention, and appropriate treatments should be implemented to reduce the risk of IBS in this population. More future studies should be conducted in Northeastern and Southwestern parts of China.",Yang W; Yang X; Cai X; Zhou Z; Yao H; Song X; Zhao T; Xiong P,2022,Frontiers in public health,10,,864721,10.3389/fpubh.2022.864721,"Yang, W., Yang, X., Cai, X., Zhou, Z., Yao, H., Song, X., Zhao, T., & Xiong, P.

36867517,Biomarkers for Bile Acid Malabsorption in Diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: A clear relationship of biological indexes between bile acid malabsorption (BAM) and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) has not been well analyzed. This meta-analysis aimed to establish a more convenient method to diagnose BAM in IBS-D patients by comparing the differences in biomarkers between IBS-D patients and healthy people.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched for relevant case-control studies. Indicators used to diagnose BAM included 75 Se-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT), 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one(C4), fibroblast growth factor-19 and 48-hour fecal bile acid (48FBA). The rate of BAM (SeHCAT) was calculated by using a random-effect model. The levels of C4, FGF19, and 48FBA were compared, and the overall effect size was combined by a fixed effect model.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 10 relevant studies comprising 1034 IBS-D patients and 232 healthy volunteers. The pooled rate of BAM in IBS-D patients was 32% (according to SeHCAT; 95% CI: 24%-40%). The level of C4 in IBS-D patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (2.86 ng/mL; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.63); The level of FGF19 was significantly lower than that in the control group (-33.97 pg/mL; 95% CI: -51.13, -16.82); The level of 48FBA was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.059; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: The results mainly concluded serum C4 and FGF19 levels in IBS-D patients. Most of the studies have different normal cutoff points of serum C4 and FGF19 levels; the performance of each test should be further estimated. By comparing the levels of these biomarkers, BAM in patients with IBS-D could be identified more accurately, which would lead to more effective treatment.",Liu T; Ma M; Li K; Tan W; Yu H; Wang L,,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,57,5,451-458,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001841,"Liu, T., Ma, M., Li, K., Tan, W., Yu, H., & Wang, L.

33327230,Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the incidence of IBS has gradually increased, and it is considered as one of the most common functional gastrointestinal diseases. However, the etiology of IBS is still unclear, and expectations are rising for more targeted treatments. Many clinical trials have explored the link between Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and IBS, with different conclusions. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore whether there is an association between H pylori and IBS, which is of great significance for targeted treatment of IBS.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between H pylori and IBS. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Library to collect related studies. OR was used to describe the ratio of the probability of the H pylori infection occurring in IBS patients versus the controls. Heterogeneity was assessed by subgroup and meta-regression analysis.
RESULTS: Eight studies, including 1861 patients, assessed the association between H pylori infection and IBS. The OR of H pylori in IBS patients compared to controls was 1.32 (95% CI: 0.94-1.87; P = 0.11). Subgroup analyses showed a difference between IBS patients diagnosed with Roman III criteria and those diagnosed with non-Roman III criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that H pylori may have a positive effect on the development of IBS. Although the differences were not statistically significant, there were significant differences among subgroups of patients. Considering the limitations and heterogeneity, high quality studies are needed to further explore the effect of H pylori on the development of IBS.",Li C; Shuai Y; Zhou X; Chen H,2020,Medicine,99,50,e22975,10.1097/MD.0000000000022975,"Li, C., Shuai, Y., Zhou, X., & Chen, H.

39683378,"Examining the Association Between Overweight, Obesity, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common yet debilitating disorder of gut-brain interaction, characterized by gut-brain axis dysregulation, visceral hypersensitivity, and other comorbidities. Obesity has been hypothesized to be a risk factor linked to IBS, albeit evidence remains conflicting. Given the growing global prevalence of obesity and IBS, we performed a meta-analysis examining their purported association.
METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies reporting the prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) of IBS according to BMI categories. Random effects meta-analyses were used for the primary analysis.
RESULTS: From 1713 articles, 27 studies were included. Our findings showed that using study-defined categories for overweight, obese, and normal BMI, the odds of the diagnosis of IBS were not associated with overweight (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; p = 0.772) or obese BMI (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; p = 0.309). The meta-analysis of study-reported adjusted odds ratios of IBS among individuals living with overweight or obesity also did not yield significant results. Further sensitivity analysis by the Rome criteria demonstrated a statistically significant association between obese BMI and IBS in studies using the Rome IV criteria (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.23; p < 0.01), with significant subgroup difference between studies using the Rome II, Rome III, and Rome IV criteria. Further sensitivity analysis using the different cut-off values and subgroup analysis by geographical territory did not yield significant associations.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, excess body weight may not be a primary driver of IBS risk. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies that account for changes in weight and other lifestyle factors, as well as detailed mechanistic investigations.",Yau CE; Lim GSJ; Ang AYH; Lim YL; Goh OQM; Siah KTH; Ng QX,2024,Nutrients,16,23,,10.3390/nu16233984,"Yau, C.

35911403,Diagnostic Utility of Non-invasive Tests for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Umbrella Review.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to consolidate evidence from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the diagnostic performances of non-invasive tests for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in various clinical conditions and age groups.
METHODS: Two independent reviewers systematically identified and appraised systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the diagnostic utility of non-invasive tests for IBD. Each association was categorized as adults, children, and mixed population, based on the age ranges of patients included in the primary studies. We classified clinical scenarios into diagnosis, activity assessment, and predicting recurrence.
RESULTS: In total, 106 assessments from 43 reviews were included, with 17 non-invasive tests. Fecal calprotectin (FC) and fecal lactoferrin (FL) were the most sensitive for distinguishing IBD from non-IBD. However, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and FL were the most specific for it. FC and FL were the most sensitive and specific tests, respectively, to distinguish IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), IgA, were the best test to distinguish Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis (UC). Interferon-γ release assay was the best test to distinguish CD from intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) were both sensitive and specific for disease activity, along with the high sensitivity of FC. Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) had the highest sensitivity, and FC had the highest specificity for operative CD recurrence.
CONCLUSION: In this umbrella review, we summarized the diagnostic performance of non-invasive tests for IBD in various clinical conditions and age groups. Clinicians can use the suggested non-invasive test depending on the appropriate clinical situation in IBD patients.",Shi JT; Zhang Y; She Y; Goyal H; Wu ZQ; Xu HG,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,920732,10.3389/fmed.2022.920732,"Shi, J.

34941977,Searching for a Definition of Refractory Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pathological mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unclarified, which commonly leads to unresponsiveness to conventional treatments. The diagnostic criteria for refractory IBS are not clearly defined. We performed a systematic review to summarize the key points of the definition of refractory IBS in different studies. We also conducted a meta-analysis to explore whether the diverse definitions for refractory IBS affect the therapeutic effect of gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH).
METHODS: We searched OVID Medline, Embase and Cochrane (until September 2020) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting patients with refractory IBS. We evaluated the definition of refractory IBS through the following aspects: duration of symptoms, unresponsive to dietary intervention, lifestyle modification, pharmacology, psychology, severity assessment and adequate explanation. The effect of the different definitions for refractory IBS on the therapeutic effect of gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) was checked by a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were finally included. Six (28.6%) out of 21 RCTs recruited patients with symptoms lasting for over 12 months; 8 (38.1%) RCTs reported a prior use of dietary intervention; 1 (4.8%) RCT reported the use of lifestyle modification; 11 (52.4%) RCTs recruited patients who were unresponsive to pharmacology; 2 (9.5%) RCTs recruited patients with no response to psychological therapy ; 5 (23.8%) RCTs had symptoms severity assessment; and 8 (38.1%) RCTs recruited patients who were informed adequately. Despite being tested in trials with heterogeneous definition of refractory IBS, GDH had similar effectiveness when compared with supportive treatment [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.69, 95%CI: -0.93 to -0.44)] or waiting-list control (SMD=-0.54, 95%CI: -0.98 to -0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Varied definitions in refractory IBS were common phenomena in clinical studies. Resistance to symptom severity assessment and psychological treatments should be more explicitly defined. Gut-directed hypnotherapy was efficacious for refractory IBS and was not affected by the diversity in the definition of refractory IBS among RCTs.",Peng WY; Ye K; Qin D; Tang TC; Chen M; Zheng H,2021,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,30,4,495-505,10.15403/jgld-3952,"Peng, W.

35121775,"A systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of non-malignant, organic gastrointestinal disorders misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.","Treatable gastrointestinal disorders in patients with symptoms typical for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be overlooked. The prevalence of five gastrointestinal conditions-bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), carbohydrate malabsorption (CM), microscopic colitis (MC), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) was systematically assessed from studies including consecutive patients meeting diagnostic criteria for IBS. 4 databases were searched from 1978 to 2020. Studies were included if they evaluated the prevalence of these conditions in secondary healthcare setting. Estimated pooled rates were calculated and statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using Q and I2 statistics. Seven studies (n = 597) estimated the pooled prevalence for BAD as 41% (95% CI 29-54). 17 studies (n = 5068) estimated that of MC as 3% (95% CI 2-4%). Two studies (n = 478) suggested a rate of 4.6% (range: 1.8-6.1%) for PEI. Using breath testing, 26 studies (n = 6700) and 13 studies (n = 3415) estimated the prevalence of lactose and fructose malabsorption as 54% (95% CI 44-64%) and 43% (95% CI 23-62%); 36 studies (n = 4630) and 22 studies (n = 2149) estimated that of SIBO as 49% (95% CI 40-57%) with lactulose and 19% (95% CI 13-27%) with glucose.

For the purpose of this review, we screened the Journal of Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies (JIPS) database with approximately 4,500 genuine placebo research articles and identified nine meta-analyses covering more than 135 randomized and placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 10,000 patients with Crohn ́s disease (CD) and another five meta-analyses with 150 RCTs and more than 10,000 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Only three discussed nocebo effects, especially in the context of clinical use of biosimilars to treat inflammation. The articles were critically analyzed with respect to the size of the placebo response in CD and UC, its effects on clinical improvement versus maintenance of remission, and mediators and moderators of the response identified. Finally, we discussed and compared the differences and similarities of the placebo responses in IBD and IBS and the nocebo effect in switching from biologics to biosimilars in IBD management.",Enck P; Klosterhalfen S,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,641436,10.3389/fphar.2021.641436,"Enck, P., & Klosterhalfen, S.

A comprehensive assessment of the literature was performed to investigate whether statin use may influence the risk of new-onset IBD. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus online databases, for articles published up to July 31, 2020. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used. We identified five retrospective studies, with seven arms, comprising >10 million participants, consisting of 89,324 cases of IBD (statin users: 14,494 versus non-users: 74,830) detected during a mean follow-up of 8.6 years. Overall, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of new-onset IBD (HR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.06; P = 0.129, I2 = 81.3%). Pooled results indicated a non-significant reduced risk of new-onset CD (HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.25; P = 0.684, I2 = 85.9%) and new-onset UC (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.12; P = 0.306, I2 = 92.5%) with statin use.

Therefore, we performed a systematic review to identify risk factors for VTE in patients with IBD during the hospitalized, post-operative, post-discharge, and ambulatory phases of care.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched from inception through to April 2024 without language restriction. We included studies that reported risk factors for VTE among adults with IBD. Summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for individual risk factors overall and stratified by phase of care using random effects models.
RESULTS: A total of 123 studies with over 23 510 969 patients were analyzed. We identified 48 variables for meta-analysis overall and 27 were significantly associated with VTE. The strongest risk factors were prior VTE (odds ratio [OR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.63-7.49), surgical complications (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.48-3.77), urgent surgery (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.62-3.35), blood transfusions (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.17-6.12), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.93-2.62), and total parenteral nutrition (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.85-2.64). Corticosteroids (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.46-1.76) but not anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97) were associated with an increased risk of VTE. No major differences were observed for most variables between hospitalized, post-operative, and post-discharge settings.

32951752,A systematic review of Tuina for irritable bowel syndrome: Recommendations for future trials.,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review assessed whether Tuina (therapeutic massage) is more effective and safer than no treatment or routine medical treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
METHODS: Eleven databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of IBS diagnosed based on Manning or Rome criteria. Tuina with or without routine treatments (RTs) was tested against RTs. The Cochrane risk of bias was evaluated for each trial. RevMan 5.3 was used to conduct a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 8 trials (5 IBS-diarrhea and 3 IBS-constipation) with 545 participants using 8 different manipulations were included. All trials were published in Chinese. For overall symptom improving rate (> 30 % improvement in overall symptom scores), it had not been shown that Tuina was significantly better than RTs (RR 1.23, 95 % CI 0.94-1.60, 197 participants, 3 studies, I2 = 65 %) for IBS-diarrhea, and Tuina combined with RTs showed more benefit than RTs alone (RR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.08-1.54, 115 participants, 3 studies) for IBS-diarrhea. All trials did not report adverse effect in relation to Tuina. Risk of bias was generally unclear across all domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuina combined with RTs may be superior to RTs for improving overall symptom of IBS-diarrhea. Due to the existing methodological issues and the heterogeneity of Tuina manipulation, current findings need to be confirmed in large scale, multicenter, and robust randomized trials (especially on outcome assessing blinding and allocation concealment).",Bu FL; Han M; Lu CL; Liu XH; Wang WG; Lai JL; Qiu XH; He BX; Zhang H; Robinson N; Fei YT; Liu JP,2020,Complementary therapies in medicine,52,,102504,10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102504,"Bu, F.

METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the clinicaltrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to February 25, 2022, updated to March 28, 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared the stool and capsule FMT with placebo in patients with IBS were included. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We did meta-analysis with RevMan, and the Stata software was used for sensitivity analysis and meta-regression. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality of evidences. Mean difference (MD) or standardized Mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous data, and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous data were used with random-effects models. The primary outcomes included the clinical response rate and IBS-SSS score. This study is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42022328377.
RESULTS: Nineteen reports from nine RCTs were included finally. Compared with the placebo, a single stool FMT could significantly decrease the IBS-SSS score at 1 month (MD=-65.75, 95%CI [-129.37, -2.13]), 3 months (MD=-102.11, 95% CI [-141.98, -62.24]), 6 months (MD=-84.38, 95%CI [-158.79, -9.97]), 24 months (MD=-110.41, 95%CI [-145.37, -75.46]), and 36 months (MD=-104.71, 95%CI [-137.78, -71.64]). It also could improve the clinical response rate at 3 months (RR=1.91, 95% [1.12, 3.25]), 24 months (RR=2.97, 95% [1.94, 4.54]), and 36 months (RR=2.48, 95% [1.65, 3.72]), and increase the IBS-QoL score at 3 months, 24 months, and 36 months. FMT did not increase the serious adverse event. The risk of bias was low, and the quality of evidence based on GRADE system was moderate in the stool FMT group. However, we did not find positive effect of capsule FMT on patients with IBS based on the current available data.
CONCLUSION: A single stool FMT is effective and safe for patients with IBS. However, some factors may affect the effectiveness of FMT, and the relationship between the gut microbiome and the effect of FMT for IBS is still unclear.

39976047,The usefulness of serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein as a novel biomarker in monitoring inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition of unknown origin. It does not have a definite cure and its response to various treatments can be evaluated based on symptom-based measures, invasive procedures, or biomarker levels, highlighting the need for an accurate biomarker. Since C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin have their shortcomings, the need for a novel biomarker remains critical. Systematic searches of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were performed In January 2024. PROSPERO number is CRD42024507383. We assessed the accuracy of leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) in identifying disease activity among patients with IBD using a bivariate diagnostic random-effects model. Fourteen studies involving 1794 individuals conducted in Japan were selected for our systematic review. The sensitivity and specificity of LRG levels for detecting disease activity were analyzed in patients with IBD and in two subgroups (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). The synthesized sensitivity and specificity were 75.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 68.9-80.9%] and 77.3% (95% CI, 69.9-83.2%), respectively, in patients with IBD, 73.1% (95% CI, 62.7-81.5%) and 81.9% (95% CI, 73.9-87.8%), respectively, in patients with CD, and the secondary analysis of the ulcerative colitis subgroup showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 72.8 and 59.7%, respectively. Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that LRG could be useful in detecting IBD activity. It is superior for detecting disease activity, especially in patients with normal CRP levels. The LRG was more accurate in monitoring disease activity in patients with CD than in patients with IBD.",Ojaghi Shirmard F; Pourfaraji SM; Saeedian B; Bagheri T; Ismaiel A; Matsumoto S; Babajani N,2025,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,37,8,891-904,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002952,"Ojaghi Shirmard, F., Pourfaraji, S.

31624009,Nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.,"The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.",Hsieh MS; Hsu WH; Wang JW; Wang YK; Hu HM; Chang WK; Chen CY; Wu DC; Kuo FC; Su WW,2020,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,119,12,1742-1749,10.1016/j.jfma.2019.09.005,"Hsieh, M.

40456878,Association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders and intestinal disorders: A systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"Patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) reported significantly more constipation and flatulence than healthy controls. An altered gut microbiome can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, comprehensive information about associated risk of intestinal disorders and ADHD remains limited. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the association between ADHD and different types of intestinal disorders. A total of 11 studies with 3,851,163 unique individuals, including 175 806 individuals with ADHD and 3 675 357 individuals without ADHD were included. The pooled OR of intestinal disorders for individuals with ADHD was 1.25 (95%CI, 0.75-2.07). A significant positive association was found between ADHD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR 1.63 [95% CI 1.45-1.83]). Studies conducted in Eastern Mediterranean Region yielded a summary OR estimate that was higher than summary OR estimates in studies conducted in Region of the Americas, European Region and Western Pacific Region (3.03 [1.53-5.99] vs. 2.20 [1.05-4.63], 1.04 [0.44-2.41], 0.68 [0.25-1.87]), with p value 0.053, indicating a trend towards significance. High heterogeneity was observed. Our study supports association between ADHD and increased risk of IBS.

39779201,Efficacy of Amitriptyline in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Amitriptyline is prescribed off-label for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We conducted a meta-analysis to assess its efficacy.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted until November 10, 2023, using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to study the efficacy of amitriptyline in patients with IBS. We included all randomized controlled trials that compared amitriptyline to placebo. Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of studies. Meta-analyses were performed using a bivariate random-effects model. Statistical analyses were performed using R Software 4.2.3 and heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics.
RESULTS: Seven trials were included with 796 patients (61% female). Amitriptyline was associated with better treatment response (OR, 5.30; 95% CI, 2.47 to 11.39; P < 0.001), reduced Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scores (MD, -50.72; 95% CI, -94.23 to -7.20; P = 0.020) and improved diarrhea (OR, 10.55; 95% CI, 2.90 to 38.41; P < 0.001). No significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the adverse effects was observed. Three trials showed an overall low risk of bias, 2 trials showed an overall high risk of bias due to randomization and missing data, and 2 trials had some concerns regarding missing data.
CONCLUSIONS: Amitriptyline was found to be well-tolerated and effective in treating IBS compared to placebo. These findings support the use of amitriptyline for the management of IBS, particularly among patients with the IBS diarrhea subtype. Future research should focus on the dose-dependent effects of amitriptyline in IBS to better guide clinicians in personalized titration regimens.",Iqbal M; Hira S; Saeed H; Shahid S; Butt ST; Rashid K; Ahmad M; Hussain H; Mughal A; Costa GPA; Gushken F; Nero N; Sengupta S; Anand A,2025,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,31,1,28-37,10.5056/jnm24084,"Iqbal, M., Hira, S., Saeed, H., Shahid, S., Butt, S.

38553410,Efficacy of probiotic supplementation and impact on fecal microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"UNLABELLED: Context: Research regarding the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with probiotics has not yielded consistent results.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in patients with IBD.
DATA SOURCES: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of probiotics in patients with IBD were searched in PubMed, the Google Scholar database, Web of Science, and CrossRef for the period July 2003 to June 2023.
DATA EXTRACTION: The RCTs were extracted, independently by 2 authors, according to the PICOS criteria.
DATA ANALYSIS: Seven studies, including a total of 795 patients, met the study criteria. Five end points were selected to evaluate the efficacy. Of these, 3 indicators showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy: C-reactive protein (odds ratio [OR]: -2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.16, -1.73, P < .01), the number of fecal Bifidobacterium (OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 3.28, 3.47, P < .01), and Lactobacillus(OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.91, 2.09, P < .01). The other 2 indicators (disease activity for Crohn's disease and for ulcerative colitis) showed no statistically significant difference, while the OR reflected a positive correlation.
CONCLUSION: Probiotics supplementation may have a positive effect on IBD by reducing clinical symptoms, reducing the serological inflammatory markers, and increasing favorable gut flora in patients with IBD. Additional RCTs are needed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of probiotics in IBD.",Xu M; Zhang W; Lin B; Lei Y; Zhang Y; Zhang Y; Chen B; Mao Q; Kim JJ; Cao Q,2025,Nutrition reviews,83,2,e65-e73,10.1093/nutrit/nuae022,"Xu, M., Zhang, W., Lin, B., Lei, Y., Zhang, Y., Zhang, Y., Chen, B., Mao, Q., Kim, J.

36130090,Perianal Crohn's Disease and the Development of Colorectal and Anal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the literature on the incidence and risk factors for colorectal cancer and anal cancer in patients with perianal Crohn's disease.
METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. A meta-analysis was then conducted using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Five studies were included in the systematic review. Of the total patients, 26.5% had perianal Crohn's disease. The median follow-up was 6 years. In total, 127 cases of colorectal cancer were found [0.43% of the included Crohn's disease patients]. Perianal involvement was present in 50% of colorectal cancer patients [0.89% of the population]. Three of the studies specified the cancer to be rectal or anal, which were present in 68 and 24 cases [0.3% and 0.1% of patients], respectively. In a subgroup analysis of rectal and anal cancer, perianal involvement was most frequent in anal cancer, accounting for 46% of the cases. In the rectal cancer group, 37% had perianal involvement. The higher incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with perianal Crohn's disease was confirmed in a meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: Half of the patients with colorectal cancer and anal cancer were found to have perianal Crohn's disease. In patients with perianal involvement, there was a higher percentage of anal cancer compared with rectal cancer. These results support the theory that patients with perianal Crohn's disease are at increased risk for developing colorectal and anal cancer.

37834010,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) poses a significant challenge due to its poorly understood pathogenesis, substantial morbidity, and often inadequate treatment outcomes. The role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in managing IBS symptoms remains inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of FMT in relieving symptoms in IBS patients. A thorough search was executed on PubMed/Medline and Embase databases until 14 June 2023, including all studies on FMT use in IBS patients. We examined the efficiency of FMT in reducing patients' symptoms overall and in particular subgroups, classified by placebo preparation, FMT preparation, frequency, and route of administration. Among 1015 identified studies, seven met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The overall symptomatology of FMT-treated IBS patients did not significantly differ from the control group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.39-2.5). Multiple doses of FMT compared with non-FMT placebo, or single-donor FMT therapy compared with autologous FMT placebo also showed no significant benefit (OR = 0.32, 95%CI (0.07-1.32), p = 0.11, and OR = 1.67, 95%CI (0.59-4.67), p = 0.32, respectively). However, a single dose of multiple-donor FMT administered via colonoscopy (lower gastrointestinal (GI) administration) significantly improved patient symptoms compared with autologous FMT placebo (OR = 2.54, 95%CI (1.20-5.37), p = 0.01, and OR = 2.2, 95%CI (1.20-4.03), p = 0.01, respectively). The studies included in the analysis showed a low risk of bias and no publication bias. In conclusion, lower GI administration of a single dose of multiple-donor FMT significantly alleviates patient complaints compared with the autologous FMT used as a placebo. The underlying mechanisms need to be better understood, and further experimental studies are desired to fill the current gaps.",Jamshidi P; Farsi Y; Nariman Z; Hatamnejad MR; Mohammadzadeh B; Akbarialiabad H; Nasiri MJ; Sechi LA,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,19,,10.3390/ijms241914562,"Jamshidi, P., Farsi, Y., Nariman, Z., Hatamnejad, M.

40258375,Efficacy of gut-brain neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gut-brain neuromodulators might be efficacious for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but there has been no synthesis of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of some drug classes, and whether they have pain-modifying properties in IBS is unclear. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs examining these questions.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (from Jan 1, 1946, to Jan 1, 2025), Embase and Embase Classic (from Jan 1, 1947, to Jan 1, 2025), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from database inception to Jan 1, 2025). Trials recruiting adults with IBS and that compared gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo over at least 4 weeks of treatment were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled using a random effects model to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95% CI.
FINDINGS: The search strategy identified 3625 citations. 28 RCTs were eligible containing 2475 patients. Ten RCTs were identified since our previous meta-analysis, containing 1348 patients. The RR of global IBS symptoms not improving with gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo in 22 RCTs (2222 patients) was 0·77 (95% CI 0·69-0·87). The best evidence in terms of persistence of global IBS symptoms was for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in 11 trials (1144 patients; RR 0·70, 0·62-0·80). The RR of abdominal pain not improving with gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo in 19 RCTs (1792 patients) was 0·72 (95% CI 0·62-0·83). The best evidence was for TCAs in seven trials (708 patients; RR 0·69, 0·54-0·87), but there was also a benefit of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in seven RCTs (324 patients; RR 0·74, 0·56-0·99), and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in two trials (94 patients; RR 0·22, 0·08-0·59). Adverse events were not significantly more common with gut-brain neuromodulators, although rates of withdrawal due to adverse events were significantly higher. The certainty in the evidence for tricyclic antidepressants for global IBS symptoms was moderate, but it was low to very low for all other endpoints and drug classes studied.
INTERPRETATION: Some gut-brain neuromodulators are efficacious in reducing global symptoms and abdominal pain in IBS. The findings support guidelines that recommend use of tricyclic antidepressants for ongoing global symptoms or abdominal pain but also highlight a potential for SSRIs to be modestly effective for abdominal pain. More data for SNRIs, azapirones, and tetracyclic antidepressants in IBS are required.

40095460,"Paradigm Shift in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Management: Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, and Emerging Therapies.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management stands at the cusp of a transformative era, with recent breakthroughs heralding a paradigm shift in treatment strategies. Traditionally, IBD therapeutics revolved around immunosuppressants, but the landscape has evolved significantly. Recent approvals of etrasimod, upadacitinib, mirikizumab, and risankizumab have introduced novel mechanisms of action, offering renewed hope for IBD patients. These medications represent a departure from the status quo, breaking years of therapeutic stagnation. Precision medicine, involving Artificial Intelligence, is a pivotal aspect of this evolution, tailoring treatments based on genetic profiles, disease characteristics, and individual responses. This approach optimizes treatment efficacy, and paves the way for personalized care. Yet, the rising cost of IBD therapies, notably biologics, poses challenges, impacting healthcare budgets and patient access. Ongoing research strives to assess cost-effectiveness, guiding policy decisions to ensure equitable access to advanced treatments. Looking ahead, the future of IBD management holds great promise. Emerging therapies, precision medicine, and ongoing research into novel targets promise to reshape the IBD treatment landscape.

36757832,Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and its association with colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
METHODS: A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar from inception to 31st January 2020 without any limitations on article type or language for studies reporting data on CRC on patients with IBS. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of CRC among patients with IBS. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were eligible for data extraction and quantitative analysis. Of them, 11 were included in the meta-analysis (IBS n = 284 366, no-IBS n = 8 390 509). The pooled prevalence of CRC in patients with IBS was 0.96% (95% CI-0.184%-2.344%). The prevalence was lowest in the constipation-predominant IBS (pooled prevalence 1.126%. Patients with IBS-D and IBS-U had an equal pooled prevalence of CRC (2.49%). Eleven studies compared the prevalence of CRC in patients with IBS with a control population. The pooled OR was 2.8 (CI 2.305-3.294).
CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased risk of CRC among patients diagnosed with IBS, primarily in the first year after IBS diagnosis.

35224726,Influence of placebo effect in mental disorders research: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) in mental disorders research commonly use active control groups including psychotherapeutic shams or inactive medication. This meta-analysis assessed whether placebo conditions (active controls) had an effect compared to no treatment or usual care (passive controls).
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Ovid, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science were searched from inception to April 2021 and reference lists of relevant articles. Three-arm RCTs, including active and passive control groups, were selected. Where individual standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculable, random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing active vs passive controls. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and meta-regression. Funnel asymmetry was evaluated using Egger's test (Prospero registration: CRD42021242940).
RESULTS: 24 articles with 25 relevant RCTs were included in the review, of which 11 studies were of high risk of bias. There was an improvement in outcomes favouring the placebo conditions, compared to passive controls, overall (25 studies, SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.06-0.42, I2 = 43%) and in subgroups with anxiety (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.07-0.84, I2 = 59%) or depression (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04-0.39, I2 = 0%). Meta-regression did not show a significant explanation for heterogeneity. Egger's test showed no asymmetry (p = .200).
CONCLUSIONS: A small placebo effect was observed in mental disorders research overall, and in patients with anxiety or depression. These findings should be interpreted with caution in the light of heterogeneity and risk of bias.",Fernández-López R; Riquelme-Gallego B; Bueno-Cavanillas A; Khan KS,2022,European journal of clinical investigation,52,7,e13762,10.1111/eci.13762,"Fernández-López, R., Riquelme-Gallego, B., Bueno-Cavanillas, A., & Khan, K.

Dysbiosis of microbiota has been tightly linked to gastrointestinal inflammatory and malignant diseases. Here we highlight the role of Helicobacter pylori alongside gastric microbiota associated with gastric inflammation and cancer. We summarize the taxonomic and functional aspects of intestinal microbiota linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and colorectal cancer in clinical investigations. We also discuss microbiome-related animal models.

33759041,The characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Although primarily a respiratory illness, several studies have shown that COVID-19 causes elevation of liver enzymes and various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms contributed toward COVID-19 severity, and identify the GI symptoms characteristic of severe COVID-19. We conducted a literature search of PubMed from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, and identified all reports with GI symptoms reported. A meta-analysis comparing the severity of COVID-19 with the presence of liver enzyme elevation and GI symptoms was performed using RevMan version 5.4. Pooled data from 15,305 unique reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive COVID-19 patients from 44 studies were analyzed. We found that the severe COVID-19 patients significantly had abdominal pain compared to the non-severe COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.17-6.27, Z = 2.32, p = 0.02, I2 = 0%) by analyzed 609 patients of 4 studies who reported both abdominal pain and COVID-19 severity. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting between the two groups. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that abdominal pain could be characteristic of severe COVID-19 infections. Compared with other viral infections that primarily infect the respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 have a slightly lower frequency of diarrheal symptoms with abdominal pain. However, to confirm this, further studies with COVID-19 patients across various countries and ethnicities are required.",Hayashi Y; Wagatsuma K; Nojima M; Yamakawa T; Ichimiya T; Yokoyama Y; Kazama T; Hirayama D; Nakase H,2021,Journal of gastroenterology,56,5,409-420,10.1007/s00535-021-01778-z,"Hayashi, Y., Wagatsuma, K., Nojima, M., Yamakawa, T., Ichimiya, T., Yokoyama, Y., Kazama, T., Hirayama, D., & Nakase, H.

39235428,The effects of vitamin D intake and status on symptom severity and quality-of-life in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Many individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have insufficient or deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status; however, it is not clear if improved vitamin D nutritional status through higher intake can improve symptom severity and quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify if changes in vitamin D intake or status affect symptom severity and quality of life in adults with IBS.Data Sources: MEDLINE®, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Global Health, EMBASE, and Web-of-Science databases were systematically searched for relevant articles to August 12, 2024, in the English language.Study Selection: Clinical trials, prospective observational studies, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses reporting the effect of vitamin D intake or status on IBS-related outcomes were included.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Article review and data extraction were conducted by 2 authors following the PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses and the Nutrition Quality Evaluation Strengthening Tools to assess risk of bias were employed for randomized controlled trials.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary outcomes included measures of serum 25(OH)D status, symptom severity, and quality of life.
RESULTS: 12 studies from 15 articles were included (n = 7 RCTs; n = 3 single-arm interventions; n = 2 MR). Seven study populations had deficient (<20 ng/mL) and three had insufficient (21-29 ng/mL) baseline serum 25(OH)D status. RCTs measured changes in serum 25(OH)D after 6-26 wks with 3,000 IU daily to 50,000 IU bi-weekly vitamin D dosages. Meta-analyses of low risk-of-bias RCTs revealed increased 25(OH)D levels in groups treated with oral vitamin D compared to placebo (n = 5; Pooled mean difference [95% CI]: 20.33 [12.91, 27.74] ng/mL; I2 = 97.9%). Quality of life scores improved significantly in deficient populations (n = 3; 3.19 [2.14, 4.24]; I2 = 0.0%). Non-significant decreased trends in IBS symptom severity were shown across populations (n = 6: -25.89 [-55.26, 3.48]; I2 = 92.8%).

33348297,Bidirectional association between irritable bowel syndrome and restless legs syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have shown that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a high risk of restless legs syndrome (RLS). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate the bidirectional association between IBS and RLS.
METHODS: All conservational studies on IBS and RLS were searched in MEDLINE (assessed by PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library database and Google Scholar from inception to June 14, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality were used to assess the methodological quality of the cohort and cross-sectional studies, respectively. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Reviewer Manager 5.3.
RESULT: A total of five cross-sectional studies of moderate methodological quality and one cohort study of high methodological quality were included in our review. Four cross-sectional studies and one cohort study involving 86 438 individuals met the criteria of IBS predicating the onset of RLS. Patients with IBS had a nearly three-fold increased odds of RLS compared with controls (OR = 2.60, 95%CI: 2.17-3.12, P < 0.00001; I2 = 48%, P = 0.11). Three sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the pooled result. Two cross-sectional studies involving 3581 individuals met the criteria of RLS predicating the onset of IBS. RLS patients had a nearly four-fold increased odds of IBS compared with controls without RLS (OR = 3.87, 95%CI: 1.73-8.66, P = 0.0010; I2 = 77%, P = 0.04).

38418112,Occurrence of Colorectal Cancer After a Negative Colonoscopy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite the application of colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance guidelines, the detection of early neoplastic lesions might be difficult in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To explore the risk of post-colonoscopy CRC (PCCRC) in patients with IBD we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed (PROSPERO; no. CRD42023453049). We included studies reporting the 3-year PCCRC (PCCRC-3y) prevalence, according to World Endoscopy Organization (WEO)-endorsed definition, in IBD and non-IBD patients. As primary outcome we evaluated the PCCRC-3y prevalence, according to WEO definitions, in IBD- and non-IBD patients and calculated the odds ratio (OR). The secondary outcome was to assess risk factors for PCCRC development in IBD patients.
RESULTS: Three retrospective observational cohort studies were included. The pooled PCCRC-3y rate in patients with IBD was 30.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=24.4-37.5%] and in non-IBD patients was 6.8% (95%CI=6.2-7.4%). The PCCRC-3y occurrence in IBD patients was significantly higher than that in non-IBD patients (OR=6.04; 95%CI=4.04-9.4; I2=95%), but a high heterogeneity among studies was noted. Furthermore, patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) had a significantly higher prevalence of PCCRC than patients with Crohn's Disease (CD): 30.9% (95%CI=27.8-34.2%) vs. 22.3% (95%CI=18-27%), respectively (OR=1.6, 95%CI=1.2-2.2; I2=0%).
CONCLUSION: One-third of CRC in IBD patients were PCCRC, and these numbers were significantly higher when compared with those in non-IBD patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of PCCRC in patients with UC was higher compared to those with CD. However, prospective studies are required to better characterize risk factors for PCCRC development in patients with IBD.",Scotti GB; Iannone I; DE Padua C; Crocetti D; Fiori G; Sapienza P; Fiori E; Avenia S; Lamazza A,2024,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",38,2,523-530,10.21873/invivo.13470,"Scotti, G.

31987249,Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
DESIGN: A computer-based search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, GreenFILE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. A hand-search of the bibliographies of relevant papers and previous meta-analyses and reviews was also undertaken. Trials were included in the review if they were double-blind and placebo-controlled investigating the effects of Western herbal medicines on IBS-related symptoms or quality of life. There were no language restrictions. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. For herbal medicines where there was more than 1 trial of similar design, data were synthesised using relative risk of symptoms improving using the random effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty-three trials were identified that met all eligibility criteria. Seventeen of these evaluated peppermint essential oil, fifteen other Western herbal medicines, and one trial evaluated peppermint oil in one arm and aniseed essential oil in the other arm. Eighteen different herbal preparations were evaluated in these trials. Data suggests that a number of Western herbal medicines may provide relief of IBS symptoms. Meta-analyses suggest that peppermint essential oil is both efficacious and well-tolerated in the short-term management of IBS. Aloe vera and asafoetida also demonstrated efficacy in reducing global IBS symptoms in meta-analyses. The herbal formulas STW 5, STW 5-II and Carmint, along with Ferula assa-foetida, Pimpenella anisum oil, the combination of Curcumin and Foeniculum vulgare oil, and the blend of Schinopsis lorentzii, Aesculus hippocastanum, and peppermint essential oil also demonstrated efficacy in rigorously-designed clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: A number of Western herbal medicines show promise in the treatment of IBS. With the exception of peppermint essential oil, Aloe vera, and asafoetida, however, none of the positive trials have been replicated. This lack of replication limits the capacity to make definitive statements of efficacy for these herbal medicines.",Hawrelak JA; Wohlmuth H; Pattinson M; Myers SP; Goldenberg JZ; Harnett J; Cooley K; Van De Venter C; Reid R; Whitten DL,2020,Complementary therapies in medicine,48,,102233,10.1016/j.ctim.2019.102233,"Hawrelak, J.

37682003,Efficacy and Safety of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Fistulizing Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) delivers 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing tissue oxygen levels and regulating inflammatory pathways. Mounting evidence suggests that HBOT may be effective for inflammatory bowel disease. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of HBOT in fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the EMBASE, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases according to the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses"" criteria. Study bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook guidelines.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies with 164 patients were included in the analysis. For all fistula subtypes, the pooled overall clinical response was 87% (95% CI: 0.70-0.95, I2 = 0) and the pooled clinical remission was 59% (95% CI: 0.35-0.80, I2 = 0). The overall clinical response was 89%, 84%, and 29% for perianal, enterocutaneous, and rectovaginal fistulas, respectively. On meta-regression, hours in the chamber and the number of HBOT sessions were not found to correlate with clinical response. The pooled number of adverse events was low at 51.7 per 10,000 HBOT sessions for all fistula types (95% CI: 16.8-159.3, I2 = 0). The risk of bias was observed across all studies.
CONCLUSION: HBOT is a safe and potentially effective treatment option for fistulizing CD.

38373643,Using interbrain synchrony to study teamwork: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"It has been proposed that interbrain synchrony (IBS) may help to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning teamwork. As hyperscanning studies have provided abundant findings on IBS in team environments, the current review aims to synthesize the findings of hyperscanning studies in a way that is relevant to the teamwork research. A systematic review was conducted. Included studies were classified according to the IPO (i.e. input, process, output) model of teamwork. Three multi-level meta-analyses were performed to quantify the associations between IBS and the three IPO variables. The methodology followed PRISMA guidelines and the protocol was pre-registered (https://osf.io/7h8sa/). Of the 229 studies, 41 were included, representing 1326 teams. The three meta-analyses found statistically significant positive effects, indicating a positive association between IBS and the three IPO teamwork variables.

36719820,"A systematic review, pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials exploring the role of fecal microbiota transplantation in irritable bowel syndrome.","BACKGROUND: Treatment is a challenge in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has attracted significant interest. Network meta-analysis (NWM) has been established as an evidence-synthesis tool that incorporates direct and indirect evidence in a collection of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapeutic intervention competing for similar therapeutic results. No NWM exists concerning the comparative effectiveness and safety of various FMT modalities for IBS.
AIM: We updated pairwise meta-analyses published in the past and assessed the comparative effectiveness and safety of various FMT delivery modalities for IBS.
METHODS: Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian NWM were performed. Heterogeneity, consistency of results and publication bias were explored.
RESULTS: Of 510 titles raised by initial search, seven RCTs were entered into meta-analyses and NWM. They included 470 patients and controls, in whom four FMT delivery modalities were used, that is via colonoscopy, nasojejunal tube, duodenoscope and capsules per os. In the pairwise meta-analysis, the pooled results showed that overall FMT was not superior to placebo, whereas the subgroup analyses showed that FMT via duodenoscope and nasojejunal tube was superior. The NWM showed that 60-g FMT via duodenoscope had the highest efficacy (OR, 26.38; 95% CI, 9.22-75.51) and was by far the highest in the efficacy ranking (SUCRA, 98.8%).
CONCLUSION: The pooled results showed no overall advantage of FMT over placebo in IBS. However, upper GI delivery (via duodenoscopy or nasojejunal tube) proved to be effective. Consequently, well-designed RCTs are needed to ensure the efficacy and safety profile before FMT can be applied in everyday clinical practice for IBS patients.",Rokkas T; Hold GL,2023,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,35,4,471-479,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002519,"Rokkas, T., & Hold, G.

39407743,Microscopic Colitis: An Underestimated Disease of Growing Importance.,"The aim of this paper is to raise awareness of MC as a clinically significant condition and to highlight its under-recognition, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and complications. This paper underlines the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with the often nonspecific symptoms of MC. In order to create this article, we reviewed available articles found in the PubMed database and searched for articles using the Google Scholar platform. Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, classified into three types: lymphocytic, collagenous, and unspecified. The average age of onset of MC is around 62-65 years and the disease is more common in women than men (nine times more common). The main symptom of MC is watery diarrhoea without blood, other symptoms include defecatory urgency, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain, nocturnal bowel movements, and weight loss. Once considered a rare disease, MC is now being diagnosed with increasing frequency, but diagnosis remains difficult. To date, a number of causative factors for MC have been identified, including smoking, alcohol consumption, medications (including NSAIDs, PPIs, SSRIs, and ICPIs), genetic factors, autoimmune diseases, bile acid malabsorption, obesity, appendicitis, and intestinal dysbiosis. It may be difficult to recognize and should be differentiated from inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), coeliac disease, infectious bowel disease, and others. Diagnosis involves biopsy at colonoscopy and histopathological evaluation of the samples. Treatment consists of budesonide oral (the gold standard) or enema. Alternatives include bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colesevelam, and colestipol), biologics (infliximab, adalimumab, and vedolizumab), thiopurines, methotrexate, and rarely, surgery.",Rutkowski K; Udrycka K; Włodarczyk B; Małecka-Wojciesko E,2024,Journal of clinical medicine,13,19,,10.3390/jcm13195683,"Rutkowski, K., Udrycka, K., Włodarczyk, B., & Małecka-Wojciesko, E.

34527656,Worldwide Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence in Pregnancy. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects outcomes of mothers and their offspring. This systematic review collated the worldwide literature on the prevalence rates of different types of IPV in pregnancy. Methods: Two reviewers independently identified cross sectional and cohort studies of IPV prevalence in pregnancy in online databases (PubMed, WOS and Scopus), selected and extracted data [participants' country, study quality, measurement tool (validation and purpose) and rates of IPV in pregnancy]. We considered a high quality study if it had a prospective design, an adequate sampling method, a sample size estimation, a response rate > 90%, a contemporary ascertainment of IPV in the index pregnancy, and a well-developed detailed IPV tool. We performed random effects meta-analysis and explored reasons for heterogeneity of rates. Results: One hundred fifty-five studies were included, of which 44 (28%) met two-thirds of the quality criteria. Worldwide prevalence of physical (126 studies, 220,462 participants), psychological (113 studies, 189,630 participants) and sexual (98 studies, 155,324 participants) IPV in pregnancy was 9.2% (95% CI 7.7-11.1%, I2 95.9%), 18.7% (15.1-22.9%, I2 98.2%), 5.5% (4.0-7.5%, I2 93.4%), respectively. Where several types of IPV were reported combined, the prevalence of any kind of IPV (118 studies, 124,838 participants) was 25.0% (20.3, 30.5%, I2 98.6%). IPV rates varied within and between continents, being the highest in Africa and the lowest in Europe (p < 0.001). Rates also varied according to measurement purpose, being higher for diagnosis than for screening, in physical (p = 0.022) and sexual (p = 0.014) IPV. Conclusions: IPV prevalence in pregnancy varies across countries, with one-quarter of mothers exposed on average globally. Routine systematic antenatal detection should be applied worldwide.

35509010,The efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder involving gut-brain interactions with limited effective treatment options. Vitamin D deficiency is commonly observed in patients with IBS, but whether vitamin D supplementation ameliorates IBS is controversial in randomized controlled trials. The present systematic review and meta-analysis explored the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in patients with IBS.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search of potentially relevant publications from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies and the Web of Science up until January 2022. We assessed the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL) and IBS total score (IBS-TS) before and after vitamin D supplementation intervention.
RESULTS: We included four randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving 335 participants. The differences in IBS-SSS score between participants in the intervention group and the placebo group increased after intervention (WMD: -55.55, 95% CI: -70.22 to -40.87, I2 = 53.7%, after intervention; WMD: -3.17, 95% CI: -18.15 to 11.81, I2 = 0.0%, before intervention). Participants receiving vitamin D supplementation showed greater improvement in IBS-SSS after intervention than participants receiving placebo treatment (WMD: -84.21, 95% CI: -111.38 to -57.05, I2 = 73.2%; WMD: -28.29, 95% CI: -49.95 to -6.62, I2 = 46.6%, respectively). Vitamin D supplementation was also superior to placebo in IBS-QoL improvement (WMD: 14.98, 95% CI: 12.06 to 17.90, I2 = 0.0%; WMD: 6.55, 95% CI: -2.23 to 15.33, I2 = 82.7%, respectively). Sensitivity analyses revealed an unstable pooled effect on IBS-TS in participants receiving vitamin D supplementation. Therefore, we did not evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D intervention in IBS-TS.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that vitamin D supplementation was superior to placebo for IBS treatment.",Huang H; Lu L; Chen Y; Zeng Y; Xu C,2022,Nutrition journal,21,1,24,10.1186/s12937-022-00777-x,"Huang, H., Lu, L., Chen, Y., Zeng, Y., & Xu, C.

37695111,Prevalence of Hepatobiliary Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A GRADE Assessed Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of more than 1.7 Million Patients.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] comprises an immune-mediated group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with IBD may experience extraintestinal manifestations, such as hepatobiliary complications. This meta-analysis aims to assess the prevalence of different hepatic manifestations in IBD patients.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were searched until July 20, 2022, by specifying keywords for IBD, hepatic manifestations, and study type. Full texts of cohort studies in English that examined the prevalence of different hepatic manifestations were included in this study. The primary outcome was the overall prevalence of hepatic manifestations in IBD patients. For the statistical analysis, a proportion by random effect model meta-analysis was performed. The registration number for the protocol of this study in PROSPERO is CRD42022369595.
RESULTS: From the 4421 articles retrieved from the primary search, 118 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. After a pooled analysis of 1 729 128 patients, the overall prevalence of hepatic manifestations was 3.49% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.31-3.68%; I2: 99.55%). The pooled prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in 228 216 patients was 26.1% [95% CI: 22.1-30.2%; I2: 99.018%]. After pooled analysis of 9642 patients, the prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis was 1.67% [95% CI: 1.47-1.88%; I2: 99.10%]. The pooled prevalence of biliary stones was 4.1% [95% CI: 3.6-4.7%; I2: 97.43%]. Autoimmune hepatitis (0.51% [95% CI: 0.26-0.75%]; I2: 85.36%) and portal vein thrombosis (0.21% [95% CI: 0.08-0.33%]; I2: 97.95%) are considered as rare manifestations.

A possible association with Fusobacterium nucleatum may provide opportunities for an early diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To review studies that address the association between F. nucleatum and CRC.
METHODS: The MEDLINE PubMed database was searched using the terms «colorectal cancer» and ""Fusobacterium nucleatum"", retrieving publications published up to January 1 2020. Stata software was used for a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The systematic review included 57 articles. Meta-analysis results indicated a more frequent presence of F. nucleatum in CRC tumour tissue samples in comparison to control samples of healthy tissue, with an odds ratio of 4.558 (95% CI: 3.312-6.272), and in comparison, to control samples of colorectal adenomas, with an odds ratio of 3.244 (95 % CI: 2.359-4.462).

35108241,Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease characterized by abdominal discomfort and bloating, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is transferring the fecal bacteria and other microorganisms from a healthy person to another. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of FMT in treating IBS patients. We searched Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases through June 2021 using relevant key words. We included 19 studies. Fecal microbiota transplantation was significantly superior to placebo in IBS quality of life after 4 weeks (mean difference [MD] = 7.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-12.89, p = .04), 12 weeks (MD = 9.99, 95% CI: 5.78-14.19, p < .00001), and 24 weeks (MD = 8.49, 95% CI: 0.47-16.52, p = .04), with no difference regarding IBS improvement symptoms and the IBS Severity Scoring System (SSS). Single-arm analysis revealed that the incidence of improvement of IBS symptoms was 57.8% (45.6%-69.9%) with reduction in IBS-SSS (MD = -74, 95% CI: -101.7 to -46.3). Fecal microbiota transplantation was superior to placebo in improving quality of life after 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Also, FMT improved IBS symptoms and reduced the IBS-SSS score. However, no deference was detected between FMT and placebo in IBS-SSS score and IBS symptoms improvement.",Elhusein AM; Fadlalmola HA,,Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates,45,1,11-20,10.1097/SGA.0000000000000652,"Elhusein, A.

36405622,Fecal microbiota transplantation in irritable bowel syndrome: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"INTRODUCTION: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proposed as a potential treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, the consensus regarding its efficacy and safety is limited.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane. Meta-analyses were conducted in relative risk (RR) or standard mean difference (SMD) using 95% confidence intervals (CI). Cochrane risk-of-bias 2 tool (RoB2) was employed to evaluate the study quality.
RESULT: Of 2,589 potential records, 7 studies with 9 cohorts involving 505 participants were included. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference in the short-term (12 weeks) and long-term (12 months) global improvement of IBS symptoms of FMT vs. placebo (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.39-1.00 and RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53-1.45, respectively). There were statistically significant differences of short-term IBS-SSS improvement (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.88) and short-term IBS-QoL improvement (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.43-0.91). Eight from 9 studies (88.9%) had a low risk of bias. The subgroup analysis revealed the short-term global symptoms improvement in studies with low-risk of bias (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.81), studies with well-defined donors (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.72), and studies with FMT using colonoscopy (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.92). Major FMT adverse events are transient and rapidly self-limiting.
CONCLUSION: FMT significantly improved IBS-SSS and IBS-QoL in the short-term period in IBS patients. However, global symptom improvement showed no significance. Well-defined donors and appropriate fecal administration routes appear to be important factors for the successful outcomes of FMT in IBS.

39407084,Efficacy and Safety of a Low-FODMAP Diet in Combination with a Gluten-Free Diet for Adult Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Common gastrointestinal disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is marked by symptoms like changed bowel habits, bloating, and stomach ache. A low-FODMAP combined gluten-free diet (LF-GFD) has been suggested as a possible therapy for IBS symptoms management.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether a LF-GFD would help patients with IBS.
METHODS: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of LF-GFD in the treatment of IBS patients. Using measurements including the visual analog scale (VAS) for bloating and pain, the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), and IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of LF-GFD in reducing IBS symptoms. Furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of LF-GFD utilizing the self- rating depression scale (SDS) and self- rating anxiety scale (SAS).
RESULTS: A total of 437 patients (221 on LF-GFD diet and 216 on GFD) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. The combined results indicated that LF-GFD reduced the VAS bloating ratings (RR = - 0.58, 95%CI - 0.92-0.23, P = 0.0010, I2 = 83%) and the VAS pain scores (RR = - 0.42, 95%CI - 0.66-0.19, P = 0.005, I2 = 58%). In addition, LF-GFD indicated a substantial enhancement in IBS-SSS scores (MD = - 1.42, 95%CI - 2.74-0.10, P = 0.03, I2 = 24%) and IBS-QoL ratings (MD = 3.75, 95%CI 0.98-6.53, P = 0.008, I2 = 33%). Moreover, the LF-GFD group showed a substantial drop in SDS (MD = - 2.56, 95%CI - 3.38-1.74, P < 0.00001, I2 = 65%) and SAS (MD = - 4.30, 95%CI - 6.53-2.24, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) scores compared to the GFD group.

31876406,Association of Intestinal Disorders with Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with an overall global incidence of 40 million. Many studies have revealed the association of intestinal disorders and bacterial infections with PD, but few studies have found such a relationship with AD. In this meta-analysis, related articles published up to September 2018 were searched in PubMed. Of the 2121 related articles screened initially, 56 were found to be eligible. Data on the risks of PD and AD due to five intestinal disorders and infection with Helicobacter pylori, as a representative intestinal microbe, were obtained, and a fixed- or random-effects model was used to pool the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) from individual studies. The combined OR for all types of intestinal disorders with an increased risk of PD was 3.36 (95% CI: 2.70-4.17). The ORs for each category were as follows: constipation, 4.05 (95% CI, 3.24-5.06); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89-1.52); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.55-5.56); small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 5.15 (95% CI, 3.33-7.96); and diarrhea, 1.27 (95% CI, 0.28-5.75). The combined OR of all types of intestinal disorders with an increased risk of AD was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09-2.13). The ORs for IBS and IBD were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.02-1.99) and 2.40 (95% CI, 1.00-5.76), respectively. The risk estimates of H. pylori infection in PD and AD patients were as follows: OR, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.43-1.91) and OR, 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12-1.76), respectively. These findings suggest that PD and AD are significantly associated with intestinal disorders. The negative roles of H. pylori in the development of PD or AD should be evaluated to shed new light on the diagnosis and treatment of PD and AD. National governments should periodically inspect the intestinal condition of residents and extend health plans to improve intestinal health to prevent potential neurological disorders.",Fu P; Gao M; Yung KKL,2020,ACS chemical neuroscience,11,3,395-405,10.1021/acschemneuro.9b00607,"Fu, P., Gao, M., & Yung, K.

38877332,Reactive Immunomodulator Addition to Infliximab Monotherapy Restores Clinical Response in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving infliximab (IFX) commonly experience immunogenic loss of response (LOR) by formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). An immunomodulator (IMM) used in combination with initial IFX induction is known to reduce ADA development and improve clinical outcomes. We aimed to assess the impact of reactively adding an IMM to patients on IFX monotherapy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study and systematic review with meta-analysis of patients with IBD demonstrating immunologic LOR, with or without clinical LOR, that had an IMM (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) reactively added (reactive combination therapy; rCT) to combat elevated ADAs and raise IFX level. Data were extracted for pooled effect size estimation using random-effects models, and ADA and IFX trough levels were compared pre- and post-IMM initiation.
RESULTS: We identified 6 patients who received rCT due to rising ADA titers and low IFX levels. Median ADA titer decreased from 506 ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR) [416-750]) to 76.5 ng/mL (IQR [25.8-232]), an 85% decrease (p = 0.031). Median IFX trough increased from 0.4 μg/mL (IQR [0.4-0.48]) to 8.25 μg/mL (IQR [3.7-9.6]), a 20.6-fold increase (p = 0.038). Meta-analysis pooled effect size of 7 studies with 89 patients showed an 87% ADA titer reduction [95% confidence interval (CI) = 72-94%], 6.7-fold increased IFX trough (95% CI = 2.4-18.7), and 76% clinical remission rescue rate (95% CI = 59-93%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest rCT is a valid rescue strategy in patients with immunogenic LOR to IFX to reduce ADA titers, restore therapeutic IFX levels, and recapture clinical remission of IBD.",Lowell JA; Sharma G; Chua V; Ben-Horin S; Swaminath A; Sultan K,2024,Digestive diseases and sciences,69,10,3920-3931,10.1007/s10620-024-08515-5,"Lowell, J.

34486656,Systematic Review of the Effects of Oat Intake on Gastrointestinal Health.,"BACKGROUND: Oats are a food source with multiple health benefits that could support beneficial bacterial groups and provide important bioactive compounds for the gut.
OBJECTIVES: This review explores the association between oat intake, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and microbial community changes in individuals with celiac disease (CeD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and without GI disease.
METHODS: Four databases and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception until April 29, 2021. Clinical trials, observational studies, and in vitro studies with human gut-derived samples were included.
RESULTS: There were 84 articles [23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 21 nonrandomized trials, 8 observational studies, and 32 in vitro studies] included. Oat intake increased total bacterial count, Lactobacilli spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. in healthy individuals and those with CeD. There was an increased concentration of short-chain fatty acids and improved gut permeability with oat intake but with no significant quality-of-life difference. In some individuals with CeD, consumption of certain oat types was associated with worsening of GI symptoms. We found no studies reporting on IBS and only 3 for IBD. The quality of RCTs showed some concerns mostly in domains of randomization (73.9%), whereas the quality of evidence of non-RCTs, observational studies, and in vitro studies was satisfactory.
CONCLUSIONS: Oat intake was associated with the increase of beneficial bacterial groups in individuals without GI disease and those with CeD. Most studies showed no changes in GI symptoms with oat consumption. In vitro studies in CeD provide insight to oat-sensitive individuals and their GI mucosa, but the clinical studies remain limited, precluding our ability to draw firm conclusions. The prevalence of oat sensitivity in individuals with CeD should be further explored as this could improve clinical management and facilitate inclusion of oat in the diet for this population.",Valido E; Stoyanov J; Bertolo A; Hertig-Godeschalk A; Zeh RM; Flueck JL; Minder B; Stojic S; Metzger B; Bussler W; Muka T; Kern H; Glisic M,2021,The Journal of nutrition,151,10,3075-3090,10.1093/jn/nxab245,"Valido, E., Stoyanov, J., Bertolo, A., Hertig-Godeschalk, A., Zeh, R.

37541185,"Histological Disease Activity as Predictor of Clinical Relapse, Hospitalization, and Surgery in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of histological remission on short- and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not well established. We assessed risk of clinical relapse, hospitalization, and need for surgery in patients achieving histological remission in comparison with active histological disease.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, and conference abstracts from inception to November 2022. Our main outcome was the rate of clinical relapse in patients with IBD who reached histological remission vs patients with active histological disease. Secondary outcomes were clinical complications of IBD such as hospitalization and need for surgery. The endpoints were investigated at 2 time points, 6 to 12 months (short term) and >12 months (long term).
RESULTS: Short-term outcome analysis showed that the risk of clinical relapse was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis patients with active histological disease in comparison with patients at histological remission (risk ratio [RR], 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-3.44; P < .01). The risk of hospitalization in ulcerative colitis patients was not significant among the 2 groups (RR, 4.22; 95% CI, 0.91-19.62; P = .07). Long-term outcome analysis demonstrated that the risk of clinical relapse (RR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.55-2.76; P < .01), need for surgery (RR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.53-6.45; P < .01), and hospitalization (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.59-4.00; P < .01) was significantly higher in patients with active histological disease.

33258340,Efficacy of Shenlingbaizhu formula on irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a Shenlingbaizhu (SLBZ) formula in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The effectiveness of SLBZ with or without conventional treatment was compared to that of conventional treatment alone.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of four Chinese electronic databases, three English language databases, and two English language trial registries from inception to June 2019 was performed. Two authors independently screened the citations and retrieved full publications of randomized trials on the use of SLBZ with or without conventional treatment for IBS. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. Data were extracted and subjected to Meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of the SLBZ formula with or without conventional treatment to conventional treatment alone.
RESULTS: Thirteen trials (comprising a total of 868 patients with IBS) were included in this review. The risk of bias of all 13 included trials was assessed as moderate. The SLBZ formula was associated with significant improvements in cure rate [relative risk (RR) score of 2.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 3.95, I 2 = 0%; 8 trials, n = 487, fixed-effects model (FEM)], diarrhea severity score [mean difference (MD) score of -0.62, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.20, I 2 = 88%; 4 trials, n = 286, random effects model (REM)], abdominal pain severity score (MD score of -0.61, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.52, I 2 = 63%; 4 trials, n = 286, FEM), and abdominal distention severity score (MD score of -0.88, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.21, I 2 = 91%; 3 trials, n = 226, REM) compared to the conventional treatment alone. Adverse events were reported in five trials but only one of these indicated any adverse events associated with SLBZ.
CONCLUSION: Based on the 13 trials reviewed here, the SLBZ formula with or without conventional treatment appeared to be safe and more effective in improving the cure rate and reducing the severity of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention compared to conventional treatment alone. However, these trials only generated a moderate quality of evidence, and well-designed and high-quality random controlled trials of the SLBZ formula for the treatment of IBS are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment option.",Wang Y; Zhang S; Zhou Q; Meng M; Chen W,2020,Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan,40,6,897-907,10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.2020.06.001,"Wang, Y., Zhang, S., Zhou, Q., Meng, M., & Chen, W.

31473156,Gut Microbial Dysbiosis in the Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Case-Control Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional digestive condition in the industrialized world. The gut microbiota plays a key role in disease pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis on case-control studies was conducted to determine whether there is gut microbial dysbiosis in participants with IBS in comparison with healthy controls and, if so, whether the dysbiosis pattern differs among IBS subtypes and geographic regions.
METHODS: This review was conducted and reported according to the MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) 2000 and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2009 guidelines. Research articles published up to May 9, 2018 were identified through MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Case-control studies of participants with IBS who had undergone quantitative gut microbial stool analysis were included. The primary exposure measure of interest is log10 bacterial counts per gram of stool. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the mean difference (MD) in gut microbiota between participants with IBS and healthy controls using the random-effects model with inverse variance in Revman 5.3 and R 3.5.1. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's test. Between-study heterogeneity was analyzed using Higgins I2 statistic with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: There were 6,333 unique articles identified; 52 qualified for full-text screening. Of these, 23 studies were included for analysis (n=1,340 participants from North America, Europe, and Asia). Overall, the studies were moderate in quality. Comparing participants with IBS to healthy controls, lower fecal Lactobacillus (MD= -0.57 log10 colony-forming unit [CFU]/g; P<0.01) and Bifidobacterium (MD= -1.04 log10CFU/g; P<0.01), higher Escherichia coli (MD=0.60 log10CFU/g; P<0.01), and marginally higher Enterobacter (MD=0.74 log10CFU/g; P=0.05). No difference was found between participants with IBS and healthy controls in fecal Bacteroides and Enterococcus (P=0.18 and 0.68, respectively). Publication bias was not observed except in Bifidobacterium (P=0.015). Subgroup analyses on participants with diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS showed consistent results with the primary results. A subgroup analysis of Chinese studies was consistent with the primary results, except for fecal Bacteroides, which was increased in participants with IBS vs healthy controls (MD=0.29; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.46; P<0.01). Although substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2>75%) in most comparisons, the direction of the effect estimates is relatively consistent across studies.

37836500,Herbal Remedies for Constipation-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND: Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Conventional treatments for IBS-C often provide limited efficiency, leading to an increasing interest in exploring herbal remedies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal remedies in the management of IBS-C.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to July 2023 and data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Overall, the included studies demonstrated some evidence of the beneficial effects of herbal remedies on IBS-C symptoms, including improvements in bowel frequency, stool consistency, abdominal pain, and quality of life. However, the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measures limited the ability to perform a meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that herbal remedies may have potential benefits in the management of IBS-C. However, the quality of evidence is limited, and further well-designed, large-scale RCTs are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of specific herbal remedies for IBS-C. Clinicians should exercise caution when recommending herbal remedies and consider individual patient characteristics and preferences.",Chiarioni G; Popa SL; Ismaiel A; Pop C; Dumitrascu DI; Brata VD; Duse TA; Incze V; Surdea-Blaga T,2023,Nutrients,15,19,,10.3390/nu15194216,"Chiarioni, G., Popa, S.

35911986,Effects and Mechanisms of Acupuncture on Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction with challenging treatment. According to evidence-based studies, acupuncture is likely to be a promising therapy and subservient adjunct for IBS. Mechanism study of acupuncture based on related clinical trials of high quality, nevertheless, is still vacant.
AIM: This study aims to assess the results and qualities of current clinical evidence and conclude the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of acupuncture on IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D).
METHODS: Literature from four databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science, was systematically searched to obtain eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which contained mechanism research of acupuncture treatment in IBS-D patients. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction and quality evaluation using the RevMan 5.4.1 software.
RESULTS: Ten trials that covered 19 items related to mechanism research were included in this review. Acupuncture was reported to improve IBS-D symptoms and quality of life, with positive effects in regulating brain-gut peptides, cerebral activities, neuroendocrine functions, psychological state, and inflammatory GI and hypersensitive intestinal tracts.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has potential influence on pathophysiology alterations such as regulating brain-gut peptides, altering cerebral connectivity and activity, promoting neuroendocrine functions and mental state, and mitigating inflammation as well as hypersensitivity of bowels in IBS-D patients, but further studies of high quality are still necessary.

METHODS: We searched four databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared FMT with a control intervention in patients with IBS. The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool was chosen for appraisal. Meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted. Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence (CoE).
RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs with a total of 615 participants. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference between the FMT and control groups in terms of clinical responses (relative risk [RR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-2.33) and changes in IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) scores (standardised mean difference [SMD] = - 0.31, 95% CI - 0.72 to 0.09) and IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) scores (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI - 0.09 to 0.69). Subgroup analysis revealed that in studies with low RoB and using endoscopy, nasojejunal tube and rectal enema delivery, FMT led to a significant improvement in clinical responses and changes in IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL scores. TSA suggested that the current evidence is inconclusive and that the CoE is very low.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that patients with IBS may benefit from FMT especially when it is administered via endoscopy, nasojejunal tube or rectal enema. However, the certainty of evidence is very low. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of FMT for IBS treatment.

36443973,Children and Adolescents with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Treatment and Management.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that causes stomach pain in children and adolescents. It may also impact one's quality of life. IBS is linked to gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea and constipation. Despite the identification of several potential pathophysiological pathways, the aetiology of IBS remained unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to discuss the diagnosis, pathogenesis, case studies and treatment of Irritable bowel syndrome in children and adolescents.
METHODS: This systematic review covered relevant papers from the previous ten years that were accessible in Science Direct, Elsevier, NCBI, and Web of Science related to the pathophysiology and function of pharmacological drugs such as antidepressants, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and antibiotics in children with irritable bowel syndrome.
RESULTS: Only a few prospective therapy techniques have been investigated in children, and even fewer of those have been demonstrated to be effective. This article presents case studies including 50-59 children, which demonstrate a favourable acceptable impact that is more effective than a placebo in terms of reducing symptoms and improving the overall quality of life in children who have irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, the majority of the pathophysiological explanations and treatment options discussed are based on adult studies. These major issues arose when treating paediatric IBS, and they must be addressed in order to properly treat children with IBS. Trials that focus on many combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies seem to be more helpful.
DISCUSSION: In recent years, a number of systematic reviews have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of medication treatments in children for IBS; however, the dependability of these systematic reviews needs to be further investigated owing to the various experimental designs and levels of evidence used. This article highlights paediatric therapy options, including pharmaceutical medications such as antidepressants, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and antibiotics. The goal is to alleviate IBS symptoms while also enhancing the quality of life for children with this illness.",Wal A; Wal P; Verma N; Pandey SS; Krishnan K; Bhowmick M,2024,Current pediatric reviews,20,2,166-177,10.2174/1573396319666221128094843,"Wal, A., Wal, P., Verma, N., Pandey, S.

37201020,Global research progress of visceral hypersensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome: bibliometrics and visualized analysis.,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of functional intestinal disorders characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, and/or stool characteristics. Recent studies have shown that there has been a significant advancement in the study of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Through the use of bibliometrics, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the knowledge structure and research hotpots of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. Methods: Publications related to visceral hypersensitivity in IBS from 2012 to 2022 were searched on the web of science core collection (WoSCC) database. CiteSpace.6.1. R2 and Vosviewer 1.6.17 were used to perform bibliometric analysis. Results: A total of 974 articles led by China and the United States from 52 countries were included. Over the past decade, the number of articles on visceral hypersensitivity and IBS has steadily increased year by year. China, the United States, and Belgium are the main countries in this field. Univ Oklahoma, Univ Gothenburg, and Zhejiang University are the main research institutions. Simren, Magnus, Greenwood-van meerveld, Beverley, and Tack, Jan are the most published authors in this research field. The research on the causes, genes, and pathways involved in visceral hypersensitivity in IBS and the mechanism of IBS are the main topics and hotspots in this field. This study also found that gut microbiota may be related to the occurrence of visceral hypersensitivity, and probiotics may be a new method for the treatment of visceral hypersensitivity and pain, which may become a new direction for research in this field. Conclusion: This is the first bibliometric study to comprehensively summarize the research trends and developments of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS.

40765115,Effects of a Low FODMAP Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Patient Experiences: A Mixed Methods Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: A low FODMAP diet reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but its impact on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is less established. This systematic review aimed to: (1) assess the effect of a low FODMAP diet in IBD and (2) understand patient experiences when implementing the low FODMAP diet.
METHODS: Four databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and CENTRAL) were systematically searched. RCTs evaluating a low FODMAP diet in IBD on disease activity, inflammatory markers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life (QoL), and qualitative studies reporting patient experiences of low FODMAP interventions (in either IBS or IBD), were included. Outcome data were meta-analysed as standardised mean differences or odds ratios. Qualitative data underwent content analysis using the Health Belief Model.
RESULTS: Five RCTs (n = 224) and two qualitative studies (n = 30 IBS patients, no studies in IBD) were included. Compared with controls, there was no effect of a low FODMAP diet on disease activity (Crohn's disease: SMD -0.33; -0.77, 0.11; ulcerative colitis: SMD -0.31; -0.78, 0.15) or faecal calprotectin (SMD -0.20; -0.49, 0.09), but lower severity of global IBS symptoms (SMD -0.56; -0.90, 0.23) and higher QoL scores (SMD 0.43; 0.05, 0.81) at end of intervention. Patients with IBS described implementation as burdensome (Severity, Barriers), inadequate professional support (Susceptibility) and found it difficult to interpret information (Susceptibility, Barriers). Meal plans and recipes (Cue to action and Self-efficacy) gained through dietitian-led information sessions were valued (Benefits).
CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet does not impact IBD disease activity and inflammation markers, but leads to improved gastrointestinal symptoms compared with controls. The diet should be considered for improving functional gastrointestinal symptoms, but not an IBD treatment. There are minimal studies about patient experiences implementing the low FODMAP diet, all in IBS. Future research should assess patient experiences of low FODMAP diet implementation, specific to IBD.

33559026,Effects of gastrointestinal delivery of non-caloric tastants on energy intake: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Taste receptors are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The activation of post-oral taste receptors using tastants could provide a non-invasive treatment option in combating the obesity epidemic. The aim of this review was to examine the effect of post-oral delivery of non-caloric tastants on eating behavior reflected by primary outcome energy intake and secondary outcomes GI symptoms and perceptions and potential underlying mechanisms. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of the Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases was performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the PROSPERO database on 26 February 2020 (ID: CRD42020171182). Two researchers independently screened 11,912 articles and extracted information from 19 articles. If at least two studies investigated the effect of the same taste compound on primary outcome energy intake, a meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled effect sizes.
RESULTS: Nineteen papers including healthy volunteers were included. In the 19 papers analyzed, effects of various tastants were investigated in healthy volunteers. Most extensively investigated were bitter tastants. The meta-analysis of effects of bitter tastants showed a significant reduction in energy intake of 54.62 kcal (95% CI - 78.54 to - 30.69, p = 0.0014).
CONCLUSIONS: Bitter stimuli are most potent to influence eating behavior. Energy intake decreased after post-oral delivery of bitter tastants. This highlights the potential of a preventive role of bitter tastants in battling the obesity epidemic.",Klaassen T; Keszthelyi D; Troost FJ; Bast A; Masclee AAM,2021,European journal of nutrition,60,6,2923-2947,10.1007/s00394-021-02485-4,"Klaassen, T., Keszthelyi, D., Troost, F.

36871131,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Is Not Associated with an Increased Risk of Polyps and Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in the US. Several factors are associated with increased/decreased CRC risk and often linked to adenomatous colorectal polyps (CRP). Recent studies suggest a lower risk of neoplastic lesions among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. We aimed to systematically assess the occurrence of CRC and CRP in IBS patients.
METHODS: Searches of the Medline, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were performed, blindly and independently, by two investigators. Studies of CRC or CRP incidence in IBS patients (diagnosed by Rome or other symptom-based criteria) were eligible for inclusion. CRC and CRP effect estimates were pooled in meta-analyses using random models.
RESULTS: Of 4941 non-duplicate studies, 14 were included, comprising 654,764 IBS patients and 2,277,195 controls in 8 cohort studies, and 26,641 IBS patients and 87,803 controls in 6 cross-sectional studies. Pooled analysis revealed a significantly decreased prevalence of CRP in IBS subjects vs. controls, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.29 (95% CI (0.15, 0.54)). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 96%, p < 0.01). This finding persisted when studies which did not report pre-cancerous polyps separately were excluded (OR 0.23, 95% CI (0.15, 0.35), I2 = 85%, p < 0.01). CRC prevalence was lower in IBS subjects, but this did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.40, 95% CI (0.09, 1.77]).
CONCLUSION: Our analyses reveal a decreased incidence of colorectal polyps in IBS, although CRC did not reach significance. Mechanistic studies with detailed genotypic analysis and clinical phenotyping are needed to better elucidate the potentially protective effect of IBS on CRC development.",Vichos T; Rezaie A; Vichos P; Cash B; Pimentel M,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,6,2585-2596,10.1007/s10620-023-07885-6,"Vichos, T., Rezaie, A., Vichos, P., Cash, B., & Pimentel, M.

Data on risk and protective influences have yielded conflicting evidence on the effects of alternative interventions, such as vitamin D. This review focuses on the effects of vitamin D on IBS. A systematic review and meta-analysis considered all articles published until 4 April 2022. The search for randomized controlled trials assessing vitamin D efficacy in IBS with outcomes, primary (Irritable Bowel Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)) and secondary (IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL) and serum level of calcifediol (25(OH)D)), was performed on six databases, Google Scholar, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, PubMed (MEDLINE), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included six trials with 616 patients. The pooled analysis found no difference between vitamin D and placebo in improving IBS-SSS (MD: -45.82 with 95% CI [-93.62, 1.98], p = 0.06). However, the pooled analysis favored vitamin D over placebo in improving the IBS-Qol (MD: 6.19 with 95% CI [0.35, 12.03], p = 0.04) and serum 25(OH)D (MD: 25.2 with 95% CI [18.41, 31.98], p = 0.00001).

35054212,Role of B-Cell Activating Factor (BAFF) in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"As early commencement of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment has been shown to substantially improve outcomes, it is of utmost importance to make a timely diagnosis of this disease. Despite undisputed sensitivity of fecal calprotectin, the most widely accepted IBD biomarker, in discriminating between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and IBD, as well as recognized role in monitoring disease activity and response to therapy, perhaps the biggest setback of calprotectin use in IBD is lack of specificity. Therefore, an additional biomarker in IBD is warranted. B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, recently emerged as a viable candidate for this role. So far, overproduction of BAFF has been observed in various autoimmune diseases, most notably in systemic lupus erythematosus, where BAFF-inhibitor belimumab was approved for treatment.

37669127,Unveiling the Ghrelin and Obestatin Roles in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Assessing Their Pathogenic Implications and Biomarker Utility.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pathologically known as chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, is among the diseases with a high burden worldwide. Ghrelin and obestatin, as adipocytokines mainly in adipose tissues, are involved in immune responses and inflammatory pathways. Studies have assessed the circulatory ghrelin levels in patients with IBD. Herein, we aim to pool these studies through systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Four international databases, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Web of Science were systematically searched for studies assessing ghrelin or obestatin levels in patients with IBD (either Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]) in active phase or in remission. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to calculate the pooled estimate using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, comprising 1064 patients with IBD (476 UC and 588 CD). A meta-analysis of 11 studies for comparison of active and quiescent disease showed that patients with active IBD had significantly higher levels of ghrelin (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.34; P = .03). However, in separate analyses for UC or CD, no such difference was observed (SMD, 1.30; 95% CI, -0.28 to 2.88, P = .11; and SMD, 0.80; 95% CI, -0.41 to 2.01; P = .20, respectively). No significant difference was also observed in ghrelin levels between patients with active IBD and healthy control subjects. Obestatin levels also were not different between patients with active disease and those in remission (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.68; P = .09). On the other hand, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly lower in patients with active IBD (SMD, -1.90; 95% CI, -2.45 to -1.35; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that IBD patients with active disease have higher levels of ghrelin, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Also, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio might be a promising biomarker for the assessment of disease activity.",Khalaji A; Babajani N; Amirsardari Z; Saeedian B; Peiman S; Berger NA; Behnoush AH,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,4,629-640,10.1093/ibd/izad202,"Khalaji, A., Babajani, N., Amirsardari, Z., Saeedian, B., Peiman, S., Berger, N.

35830045,A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS IN SCHOOLCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS ACCORDING TO ROME IV CRITERIA.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in children according to Rome IV criteria.
METHODS: We included cohorts and observational descriptive studies, including information for the prevalence of FGIDs according to Rome IV criteria in children 4 to 18 years old. We searched the MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL databases from May 2016 to nowadays. Gray literature and other databases were also consulted. The risk of bias was assessed using the STROBE Statement. The results were reported in forest plots of the estimated effects of the included studies with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
RESULTS: We included 14 studies involving a total of 17427 participants. Three studies were conducted in Europe, two in North America, and nine in Latin America. Most studies were school-based (n=14670, 84.18%), participants were mostly female (55.49%), white (51.73%), 8 to 18 years old (77.64%), and assisted to a public school (81.53%). Thirteen studies used the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS-RIV) to assess FGIDs. We found a global prevalence for FGIDs of 23% (95%CI 21-25%, I2 99%). Main disorders were functional constipation (FC) with 12% (95%CI 11-15%) followed by functional dyspepsia (FD) (5%, 95%CI 11-15%) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (3%, 95%CI 2-4%). The prevalence of FGIDs was higher in the Americas, representing 23.67% (95%CI 21.2-26.2%, I2 91.3%).

37747431,Prognostic impact of serum testosterone in metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In daily practice, there is an unmet medical need for biomarkers that facilitate therapeutic decision-making in the metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) scenario. Although recent studies have highlighted the potential of testosterone as a prognostic and predictive marker in prostate cancer, the evidence is controversial. The objective of this review was to summarize and analyze the scientific evidence regarding the prognostic role of basal testosterone levels in patients with mHSPC.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed. Three authors selected the articles from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library electronic databases. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the selected articles suggest that low testosterone levels before starting hormonal blockade imply a worse prognosis for patients with mHSPC. However, the quality of the evidence is poor, the studies are heterogeneous, and it is not possible to meta-analyze most of the published results.
SUMMARY: Testosterone is an accessible and affordable biomarker. If it were correctly demonstrated that it harbors a prognostic and/or predictive role in the mHSPC setting, it could represent an advance in decision-making in these patients. Well designed prospective studies are needed to correctly answer this question.",Puche-Sanz I; Chiu P; Morillo AC; Gomez-Gomez E,2023,Current opinion in urology,33,6,472-481,10.1097/MOU.0000000000001132,"Puche-Sanz, I., Chiu, P., Morillo, A.

36251040,Probiotics therapy for adults with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs.,"PURPOSE: Accumulating evidence showed that probiotics therapy might be effective in treating diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics therapy for the treatment of IBS-D.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search in eight electronic databases, and gray literature from inception to August 4, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics therapy for the treatment of IBS-D were included and the quality was assessed using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0. RevMan 5.4 software was used to perform the meta-analysis on the outcomes of IBS-D symptoms, abdominal pain, quality of life, and abdominal distension. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: Ten RCTs evaluating 943 patients were identified. Only one study had unclear risk of bias, while nine studies had a high risk of bias. The meta-analysis results showed that, compared to the placebo, probiotics therapy significantly decreased the score of IBS-D symptoms (SMD = - 0.55, 95% CI: [- 0.83, - 0.27], P < 0.05), abdominal pain (SMD = - 0.43, 95% CI: [- 0.57, - 0.29], P < 0.05), and abdominal distension (SMD = - 0.45, 95%CI: [- 0.81, - 0.09], P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the quality of life. However, all the certainty of evidence was very low.
CONCLUSION: Very low certainty evidence showed that probiotics might be an effective treatment for improving the IBS-D symptoms, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension, in adult IBS-D patients. However, these conclusions should be supported by high-quality evidence.",Wang Y; Chen N; Niu F; Li Y; Guo K; Shang X; E F; Yang C; Yang K; Li X,2022,International journal of colorectal disease,37,11,2263-2276,10.1007/s00384-022-04261-0,"Wang, Y., Chen, N., Niu, F., Li, Y., Guo, K., Shang, X., E, F., Yang, C., Yang, K., & Li, X.

40186219,Clinical effects of probiotics on the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of probiotics as an adjunct to periodontal therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with gingivitis and periodontitis through a meta-analysis of available evidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A detailed bibliographic search on four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and EMBASE) was conducted with a language restriction. The collected data were assessed according to the predefined eligibility criteria and randomized clinical trials reporting the effects of probiotics on plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP) and pocket probing depth (PPD) compared to control or placebo groups were selected and analysed. The risk of bias assessment was conducted using SYRCLE's RoB- 2 tool. The GRADEpro tool was used to determine the overall quality of evidence.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies (10 about gingivitis and 14 about periodontitis) were included in the meta-analysis. In the gingivitis studies, lower but non-significant PI and BOP were found in the probiotic group. In periodontitis, lower PI (95%-CI [- 0.54; - 0.15], p = 0.001) were reported in the probiotic group, and this difference was greater in studies with longer follow-up. Lower BOP (95%-CI [- 0.58; - 0.05], p = 0.021) was also reported, but this difference was only significant in studies with a shorter follow-up (95%-CI [- 0.86; - 0.11], p = 0.012). Meta-analysis for PPD showed lower, but non-significant, values (95%-CI [- 0.53; + 0.03], p = 0.077). However, this difference became significant when assessing studies with shorter follow-up (95% CI [- 0.77; - 0.07], p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis provides evidence suggested that probiotics can serve as a beneficial adjunct to periodontal treatment in patients with periodontitis, particularly in improving clinical outcomes such as plaque index and bleeding on probing. The results from gingivitis studies highlight the need for further investigation to better understand the impact of probiotics in the early stages of periodontal disease. These findings emphasize the importance of future research with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods to confirm and expand on the clinical utility of probiotics in periodontal therapy.",Benavides-Reyes C; Cabello I; Magán-Fernández A; Rodríguez-Barranco M; Usta SN; Mesa F,2025,BMC oral health,25,1,490,10.1186/s12903-025-05888-5,"Benavides-Reyes, C., Cabello, I., Magán-Fernández, A., Rodríguez-Barranco, M., Usta, S.

39130122,"Role of Nutrition in Gastroesophageal Reflux, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Celiac Disease, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.","There remains a paucity of data on the efficacy of nutritional interventions in luminal gastrointestinal disorders. This review appraises the evidence supporting dietary modification in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, Celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Alhough the use of elimination diets; high fat/low carb; low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols; and lactose-free diets in GERD have been studied, the evidence supporting their efficacy remains weak and mixed. Patients with GERD should avoid eating within 3 hours of lying recumbent. Studied dietary interventions for disorders of gut-brain interaction include low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols and gluten-restricted and lactose-free diets. While all can be effective in carefully, individually selected patients, the evidence for each intervention remains low. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, enteral nutrition is established in pediatric populations as useful in reducing inflammation and partial enteral nutrition has a growing evidence base for use in adults and children. Specific carbohydrate diets and the Crohn's disease exclusion diet show promising evidence but require further study to validate their efficacy prior to recommendation. Overall, the evidence supporting nutritional therapy across luminal gastrointestinal disorders is mixed and often weak, with few well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating consistent efficacy of interventions.

38892659,Changes in Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids in IBS Patients and Effects of Different Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"CONTEXT: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the results are conflicting.
OBJECTIVE: Here, a systematic review of case-control studies detecting fecal SCFAs in IBS patients compared with healthy controls (HCs) and self-controlled studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating fecal SCFA alterations after interventions were identified from several databases.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) identified 21 studies published before 24 February 2023. Data extractions: Three independent reviewers completed the relevant data extraction.
DATA ANALYSIS: It was found that the fecal propionate concentration in IBS patients was significantly higher than that in HCs, while the acetate proportion was significantly lower. Low-FODMAP diets significantly reduced the fecal propionate concentration in the IBS patients while fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic administration did not significantly change the fecal propionate concentration or acetate proportion.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the fecal propionate concentration and acetate proportion could be used as biomarkers for IBS diagnosis. A low-FODMAP diet intervention could potentially serve as a treatment for IBS while FMT and probiotic administration need more robust trials.",Ju X; Jiang Z; Ma J; Yang D,2024,Nutrients,16,11,,10.3390/nu16111727,"Ju, X., Jiang, Z., Ma, J., & Yang, D.

34358238,Efficacy of probiotic adjuvant therapy for irritable bowel syndrome in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects children's quality of life and learning. The purpose of this research was to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotic adjuvant therapy for IBS in children.
METHODS: The Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Clinical Trials databases were electronically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to January 2021 exploring the use of probiotic adjuvant therapy for IBS in children. Strict screening and quality evaluations of the eligible articles were performed independently by 2 researchers. Outcome indexes were extracted, and a meta-analysis of the data was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 and STATA 16 software. Finally, the risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with the RCT bias risk assessment tool recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (5.1.0).
RESULTS: A total of nine RCTs were included. In children, probiotics significantly reduced the abdominal pain score (I2 = 95%, SMD = -1.15, 95% (-2.05, -0.24), P = 0.01) and Subject's Global Assessment of Relief (SGARC) score (I2 = 95%, MD = -3.84, 95% (-6.49, -1.20), P = 0.004), increased the rate of abdominal pain treatment success (I2 = 0%, RR = 3.44, 95% (1.73, 6.87), P = 0.0005) and abdominal pain relief (I2 = 40%, RR = 1.48, 95% (0.96, 2.28), P = 0.08), and reduced the frequency of abdominal pain (I2 = 2%, MD = -0.82, 95% (-1.57, -0.07), P = 0.03). However, we found that it might not be possible to relieve abdominal pain by increasing the daily intake of probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are effective at treating abdominal pain caused by IBS in children, however, there was no significant correlation between abdominal pain and the amount of probiotics ingested. More attention should be given to IBS in children, and a standardized evaluation should be adopted.",Xu HL; Zou LL; Chen MB; Wang H; Shen WM; Zheng QH; Cui WY,2021,PloS one,16,8,e0255160,10.1371/journal.pone.0255160,"Xu, H.

33530231,Efficacy of opioid receptor modulators in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: While irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal diseases in clinical practice, it has diverse pathogenesis. Because of its sudden and lingering intractable symptoms, it seriously affects patients work and life. Opioid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors distributed across the brain, spinal cord, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, and each of the subtypes has a unique role and specific distribution. They play a role in regulating gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and visceral sensations in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of opioid receptor modulators on improving the symptoms of IBS.
METHODS: Searching the key words (Irritable Bowel Syndromes or Syndrome, Irritable Bowel OR Syndromes, Irritable Bowel OR Colon, Irritable OR Irritable Colon OR Colitis, Mucous OR Colitides, Mucous OR Mucous Colitides OR Mucous Colitis) AND (opioid receptor modulators OR eluxadoline OR Viberzi OR asimadoline OR loperamide), a preliminary search on PubMed (English), EMBASE (English), Cochrane Library (English), China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI, Chinese), WanFang (Chinese), VIP citation databases (Chinese) and SinoMed (Chinese) databases yielded 1023 papers published in English and Chinese from inception to July 1, 2019. Nine studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Because this is a systematic review and meta-analysis, ethical approval is not necessary.
RESULTS: The random-effects meta-analysis based on these 9 studies and their 4156 patients found that opioid receptor modulators have a statistically significant beneficial effect on IBS global symptoms (RR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.79-0.92, P < .01) and bowel movement frequency (SMD = -1.26, 95%CI = -2.49--0.04, P < .05), and while there was an improvement trend in stool consistency and quality of life, these findings were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analysis to examine the use of opioid receptor modulators in IBS, and few adverse events were reported in the available trials. Compared with the control group, eluxadolin has a better effect in improving IBS global symptoms and abdominal pain and has statistical significance and showed a low rate of constipation development in IBS patients in comparison with known effects of other opioid receptor modulators. However, current findings are based on a considerably limited evidence base with marked heterogeneity. Future studies should aim to identify subpopulations of patients with IBS and need to evaluate the long-term safety of these therapies.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020141597.",Li X; Li B; Zhang J; Chen T; Wu H; Shi X; Ma J; Qin J; Tang X; Wang F,2021,Medicine,100,4,e24361,10.1097/MD.0000000000024361,"Li, X., Li, B., Zhang, J., Chen, T., Wu, H., Shi, X., Ma, J., Qin, J., Tang, X., & Wang, F.

There is currently no reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of IBS, and the current approach depends on ruling-out organic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer by markers of inflammation like fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein, or invasive procedures like a colonoscopy. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are growing in popularity as a biomarker due to its accuracy and ease of use.
PURPOSE: This systematic review of Medline and Cochrane's databases aimed to identify VOCs in the diagnosis of IBS. 57% of the studies proved that VOCs could identify IBS patients from healthy controls with AUC ranging from 0.83 to 0.99. Studies that distinguished IBS from IBD patients had slightly higher AUC of 0.87-0.98. Combining VOC into panels allowed the creation of discriminative algorithms. Though current research is limited by areas of heterogeneity in VOC sampling and small sample sizes, our review shows that VOC analysis has the potential to be a noninvasive point-of-care test that differentiates IBS from other organic gastrointestinal diseases.",Zhang VR; Ramachandran GK; Loo EXL; Soh AYS; Yong WP; Siah KTH,2023,Neurogastroenterology and motility,35,7,e14536,10.1111/nmo.14536,"Zhang, V.

32961342,Potential Benefit With Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may pursue complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining efficacy of CAM vs. placebo or sham in adults with IBS.
METHODS: Publication databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of CAM therapies (herbal therapy, dietary supplements, mind-body based, body-based, and energy-healing) in adults with IBS. Data were extracted to obtain pooled estimates of mean improvement in abdominal pain (standardized mean difference [SMD]) and relative risk (RR) of overall response using random effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses along with quality assessments were completed.
RESULTS: Among 2825 articles identified, 66 were included. Herbal therapy (SMD=0.47, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.75, I2=82%) demonstrated significant benefit over placebo for abdominal pain (low confidence in estimates). Benefit with mind-body based therapy for abdominal pain was of borderline significance (SMD=0.29, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.59, I2=78%). Herbal therapy (RR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.88, I2=77%), dietary supplements (RR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.73, I2=75%), and mind-body based therapy (RR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.49, I2=63%) showed benefit for overall response compared to placebo (low confidence in estimates). Body-based and energy healing therapies demonstrated no significant benefit over placebo or sham for abdominal pain or overall response.
CONCLUSIONS: CAM therapies such as herbal or dietary supplements and mind-body based approaches may be beneficial for abdominal pain and overall response in IBS. However, overall quality of evidence is low. Rigorous, high quality clinical trials are warranted to investigate CAM in IBS.",Billings W; Mathur K; Craven HJ; Xu H; Shin A,2021,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,19,8,1538-1553.e14,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.09.035,"Billings, W., Mathur, K., Craven, H.

31987224,Endocannabinoid system in irritable bowel syndrome and cannabis as a therapy.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) global burden is underestimated despite its high prevalence. It's a gastrointestinal disease having obscure pathophysiology with multiple therapies yet unsatisfactory remedies. The Endocannabinoid system (ECS) of our body plays a key role in maintaining normal physiology of the gastrointestinal tract as well as involves abnormalities including functional diseases like IBS. This review highlights the importance of the Endocannabinoid system, its connections with the normal gastrointestinal functions and abnormalities like IBS. It also discusses the role of cannabis as medical therapy in IBS patients. A literature search for articles related to endocannabinoids in IBS and medical cannabis in PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted. The studies highlighted the significant participation of ECS in IBS. However, the breach in obtaining the promising therapeutic model for IBS needed further investigation in ECS and uncover other treatments for IBS.

35207315,The Efficacy of Mebeverine in the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome-A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal tract disorder, affecting 10-20% of adults worldwide. Mebeverine is an antispasmodic agent indicated for the symptomatic treatment of abdominal pain caused by intestinal smooth muscle spasms and intestinal functional disorders in the course of IBS. The aim of this article was to perform a systematic literature review and update previous overviews of the efficacy and safety of mebeverine treatment in IBS.
METHODS: Major electronic medical databases, PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane, were systematically searched from January 1965 to January 2021.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria, including 19 randomised trials, two observational retrospective studies, and one non-randomised, single-blinded study. Six studies reported a significant decrease in abdominal pain after mebeverine treatment (p-values ranging from <0.05 to <0.001). Only three studies showed no improvement after mebeverine treatment in terms of the severity of abdominal pain or discomfort. Some of the included studies also showed significant improvements in abnormal bowel habits, abdominal distension, as well as stool frequency and consistency. Adverse events were rare and associated mainly with IBS symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Mebeverine is an effective treatment option in IBS, with a good safety profile and low frequency of adverse effects.",Daniluk J; Malecka-Wojciesko E; Skrzydlo-Radomanska B; Rydzewska G,2022,Journal of clinical medicine,11,4,,10.3390/jcm11041044,"Daniluk, J., Malecka-Wojciesko, E., Skrzydlo-Radomanska, B., & Rydzewska, G.

37764853,"The Effect of Polyphenols, Minerals, Fibers, and Fruits on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Various dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and management of IBS symptoms. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of polyphenols, minerals, fibers, and fruits on the symptoms and overall well-being of individuals with IBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies published up until July 2023 were included.
RESULTS: The selected studies varied in terms of study design, participant characteristics, intervention duration, and outcome measures. Overall, the findings suggest that dietary interventions involving polyphenols, minerals, fibers, and fruits can have a positive impact on IBS symptoms. Dietary fiber supplementation, particularly soluble fiber, has been associated with reduced bloating and enhanced stool consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of polyphenols, minerals, fibers, and fruits in IBS patients. These dietary components hold promise as complementary approaches for managing IBS symptoms. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the limited number of high-quality randomized controlled trials, further well-designed trials are warranted to establish the optimal dosages, duration, and long-term effects of these interventions.

Alterations of the microbiota are being increasingly linked to various disease states. The microbiome has been manipulated via the administration of stool from animals or humans, for more than 1000 years. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation can be performed via endoscopic administration of fecal matter to the duodenum or colon or via capsules of lyophilized stools. More recently fecal microbial transplantation has been shown to be very effective for recurrent Clostridoides difficile infection (CDI). In addition there is some evidence of efficacy in the metabolic syndrome and its hepatic manifestation, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

39560589,Efficacy of acupuncture treatment for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome with comorbid anxiety and depression: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Presently, a diverse range of Western medical interventions are accessible for the management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) concomitant with comorbid anxiety and depression. However, the concomitant adverse effects have also surfaced, exerting strain on healthcare resources and the socio-economic structure. In recent times, the benefits of acupuncture in the management of IBS-D with coexisting anxiety and depression have become progressively evident. Nevertheless, a paucity of evidence-based medicine exists to substantiate the utilization of acupuncture for the treatment of IBS-D with anxiety and depression. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture as an intervention for IBS-D with comorbid anxiety and depression.
METHODS: We searched 7 databases, including the Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Academic Journals Full-text Database, VIP Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to acupuncture treatment for IBS with anxiety and depression, published from database inception to August 1, 2023. RevMan 5.4 and Stata 17.0 software were used for meta-analysis of relevant outcome measures.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 16 RCTs, involving 1305 IBS-D patients (691 in the experimental group and 614 in the control group). The meta-analysis results showed that compared to oral medication, acupuncture therapy improved HAMD scores (MD = 0.88, 95% CI = [0.68, 1.07], P < .00001), HAMA scores (MD = 2.32, 95% CI = [1.70, 2.93], P < .00001), self-rating anxiety scale scores (MD = 11.67, 95% CI = [10.85, 12.49], P < .00001), SDS scores (MD = 9.84, 95% CI = [8.52, 11.16], P < .00001), IBS-SSS scores (MD = 37.48, 95% CI = [12.17, 62.78], P = .004), overall response rate (MD = 1.27, 95% CI = [1.20, 1.35], P < .00001), and relapse rate (MD = 0.27, 95% CI = [0.16, 0.47], P < .00001) in patients with IBS-D comorbid with anxiety and depression.

40035292,The effects of low FODMAP diet on gut microbiota regulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet on gut microbiota regulation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Data databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low FODMAP diets with normal diets were included. The primary outcome was the effect on intestinal flora. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. Ten RCTs involving 590 participants were included in the analysis. The low FODMAP diet showed a significant positive effect on intestinal flora compared to normal diets (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI [0.01, 0.64], p = 0.003). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 67.5%). Subgroup analysis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients revealed no significant difference between low FODMAP and normal diets (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.32], p = 0.306), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 17.0%). No significant publication bias was detected (Egger's test, p = 0.328). This meta-analysis suggests that a low FODMAP diet may have a positive effect on gut microbiota regulation. However, the effect appears to be less pronounced in IBS patients. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the long-term impact of low FODMAP diets on gut health across various gastrointestinal disorders.",Chu P; He Y; Hu F; Wang X,2025,Journal of food science,90,3,e70072,10.1111/1750-3841.70072,"Chu, P., He, Y., Hu, F., & Wang, X.

38021554,"Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Management of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Saudi Arabia: A Systematic Review.","The prevalence and associated risk factors of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been a significant area of focus in several studies conducted in Saudi Arabia. These studies have looked at varied populations, including school teachers, university students, and the general populace. The reported prevalence rates for IBS vary substantially across studies, ranging from 7.9% to an astounding 49.3%. The average prevalence noted across these studies is about 24%. The aim of this review is to collate, compare, and analyze data from these studies, hoping to shed light on the key risk factors and demographic trends associated with IBS in Saudi Arabia. This review encompasses data from 20 studies, aggregating information from 17,018 participants. The research methodologies adopted by each of these studies have been analyzed, especially focusing on their sample sizes, which vary significantly. Furthermore, the review incorporates details on the socio-demographic attributes of the participants, including age specifics, gender representation, and geographical distribution within Saudi Arabia. The results demonstrate a wide variability in IBS prevalence among different groups. The overall prevalence of IBS in Saudi Arabia based on the provided data is approximately 24%. Gender-based breakdown in some studies indicated varying prevalence among males and females, which indicated that females are more prone to the disease. The same for certain age groups, specifically between 51 and 60 years, which showed slightly higher rates. Factors such as educational discipline, living conditions, mental health, dietary habits, family history of IBS, and certain comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus were found to influence the occurrence of IBS in different cohorts. Moreover, lifestyle factors such as low water intake, lack of dietary fiber, stress, and even caffeine intake were associated with IBS. Socioeconomic aspects, including family income levels and academic performance, were also hinted to have a potential link with IBS prevalence. In light of the presented data, it is evident that IBS prevalence in Saudi Arabia is influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from genetic and dietary to psychological and socioeconomic. The substantial variations in prevalence across different cohorts suggest the need for a more nuanced understanding of this condition, specifically tailored to the unique demographics and cultural contexts of Saudi Arabia.

39862384,Effects of Probiotics and Diet Management in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"CONTEXT: The efficacy of probiotics and diet management in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial, and their relative effectiveness remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics, diet management, and their combination on IBS.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 10, 2023, for relevant studies, including symptom relief, IBS-symptom severity score (-SSS), and IBS-quality of life measure (-QOL).
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently performed the data extraction and quality assessment.
DATA ANALYSIS: A network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach and a random-effects model to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI.
RESULTS: Forty-four articles were eligible for this study. In relieving IBS symptoms, compared with a sham diet, a low-fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (low-FODMAP) diet (RR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.70-6.26) and low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (RR: 17.79; 95% CI: 3.27-112.54) significantly relieved IBS symptoms. The control group showed significantly lower effectiveness than the probiotics group (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.32-0.69). According to the surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA), a low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (80.4%) had the best effect in relieving IBS symptoms, followed by a low-FODMAP diet (70.8%), probiotics (65.1%), and a gluten-free diet (54.3%). In reducing the total IBS-SSS, the low-FODMAP diet (90.5%) was the most effective, followed by the low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (76.6%), probiotics alone (62.3%), and gluten-free diet (28.3%). In reducing total IBS-QOL, probiotics (72.1%) ranked first, followed by gluten-free (57.0%) and low-FODMAP (56.9%) diets. Probiotics (34.9%) were associated with the lowest risk of adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: A low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics is most effective in relieving IBS symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet is the most recommended diet for alleviating IBS severity, and probiotics were associated with improving the QOL of patients with IBS, with the fewest adverse events.

36017012,External therapy of traditional Chinese medicine for treating irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that has a significant impact on quality of life, work productivity, and healthcare resources. External therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has positive effects on IBS-D and is simple, convenient, and low-cost. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of external therapy of TCM for IBS-D.
METHODS: This study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals (VIP), Wan Fang, and Chinese Biomedical (CBM) databases were electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials comparing external therapy of TCM with Western medicine for IBS-D from inception to 31 December 2021. Two authors independently screened, extracted, and assessed the selected studies. The Jadad scale and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool were used to evaluate study quality. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE). The meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager software (version 5.3).
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 1,862 subjects were included. Acupuncture and moxibustion were the most commonly used external therapies. The meta-analysis showed that based on total effective rate with moderate certainty of evidence (n = 21 studies, n = 1,862 participants, RR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.2, 1.31], I2 = 0%, P < 0.00001), clinical cure rate with low certainty of evidence (n = 17 studies, n = 1,502 participants, RR = 1.66, 95% CI [1.4, 1.96], I2 = 1%, P < 0.00001), recurrence rate with very low certainty of evidence (n = 5 studies, n = 260 participants, RR = 0.44, 95% CI [0.34, 0.58], I2 = 0%, P < 0.00001), total symptom score (MD = -4.9, 95% CI [-7.34, -2.47]), and IBS severity scoring system score (IBS-SSS) with moderate certainty of evidence (MD = -52.72, 95% CI [-63.9, -41.53]), the experimental group had significant advantages compared with the control group. The sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of the primary outcomes. The improvement in quality of life associated with IBS (IBS-QOL) was superior in the experimental group compared to the control group, and the difference was statistically significant; however, the clinical heterogeneity was strong. The inverted funnel plot of the included studies indicated a potential publication bias.
CONCLUSION: External therapy of TCM for IBS-D alleviated abdominal symptoms, improved clinical effectiveness, and reduced recurrence with great safety. However, because of the limitations of publication bias in trials, more rigorous studies with a clinical design are necessary for further verification of the outcomes.

38699957,A systematic review of the association between environmental risk factors and the development of irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with roots in genetic, immune, psychological, and dietary factors. Recently, the potential correlation between environmental exposures, such as air pollution, and IBS has gained attention. This review aimed to systematically examine existing studies on environmental factors associated with IBS, elucidating this interplay and guiding future research.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from database inception to October 10, 2023, using the keywords ""Irritable Bowel"" or IBS or ""Irritable Colon"" or ""Mucous Colitis"" or ""Spastic Colitis"" or ""Spastic Colon"" AND ""environment* exposure*"". Studies were included if they were original, published in English, described defined environmental exposure(s), and had documented diagnosis of IBS. For the purposes of this review, articles reporting physical (e.g. radiation and climate change), biological (e.g. bacteria and viruses), and chemical (e.g. harmful gases) exposures were included while psychological and dietary factors, which have been reviewed in detail elsewhere, are outside of the scope.
RESULTS: A total of seven studies focusing on air quality, microbial exposure, and other environmental factors were reviewed. Studies highlighted a potential association between air pollutants and increased IBS incidence. Microbial exposure, post-natural disaster or due to poor sanitation, was linked to IBS development and gut dysbiosis. Other exposures, such as early pet ownership, were also associated with IBS risk.
CONCLUSION: Existing research demonstrates an epidemiologic relationship between environmental exposures and the development of IBS. Further research is needed to understand these associations.",Ng QX; Yaow CYL; Moo JR; Koo SWK; Loo EXL; Siah KTH,2024,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,39,9,1780-1787,10.1111/jgh.16587,"Ng, Q.

35848115,Comparing probiotic and drug interventions in irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Clinical decisions made by health professionals to recommend either drug or probiotic interventions for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be supported by proper knowledge of the efficacy rates of both types of interventions. In this article, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of both probiotic- and drug interventions in IBS. Medline was searched between January 2015 - January 2021. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) recruiting participants > 18 years old with IBS and examining the effect of probiotics or drugs were eligible for inclusion. The data of the primary outcome, i.e. the persistence of IBS symptoms (dichotomous symptom data), were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes, abdominal pain- and bloating scores (continuous data), were pooled using a standardised mean difference with a 95% CI. The search identified 269 citations of which 32 RCTs were eligible. Our meta-analysis indicated that both probiotic and drug interventions are able to improve the persistence of IBS symptoms (RR 0.60 [0.51; 0.92] versus 0.87 [0.81; 0.92], respectively) and abdominal pain scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35 [-0.56; -0.14] versus -0.10 [-0.20; 0.00], respectively). However, determining the overall efficacy of both intervention types is inherently complex and such results should be interpreted with care, due to the large diversity of probiotic- and drug types and doses, which is also complicated by variety in IBS subtypes. Hence, as a first step, more large scale randomised double blind placebo-controlled trials focussing on a specific IBS subtype targeted with specific probiotic strains or specific pharmaceutical modalities should be executed, enabling a more proper comparison between trials.",van der Geest AM; Schukking I; Brummer RJM; van de Burgwal LHM; Larsen OFA,2022,Beneficial microbes,13,3,183-194,10.3920/BM2021.0123,"van der Geest, A.

33407171,Alterations in short-chain fatty acids and serotonin in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) may be associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are some reports of alterations in SCFAs and 5-HT in IBS, but their results are inconsistent. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to assess alterations in SCFAs and 5-HT in IBS patients and their potential role in the abnormal brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) axis.
METHODS: Case-control studies detecting SCFAs and 5-HT in IBS patients were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases to identify relevant articles up to September 2018. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SCFAs and 5-HT were calculated by REVIEW MANAGER 5.3 to evaluate the alterations of 5-HT and SCFAs in IBS.
RESULTS: Five studies on SCFAs and 5 on 5-HT in IBS patients were included. As compared to healthy controls (HCs), the SMDs of 5-HT in IBS patients was 2.35 (95% CI 0.46-4.24) and the SMDs of total SCFAs, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in IBS patients were - 0.01 (95% CI - 0.57-0.55), - 0.04 (95% CI - 0.55-0.47), 0.07 (95% CI - 0.45-0.60), and - 0.00 (95% CI - 0.49-0.49), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in 5-HT in blood of IBS patients, indicating the increased 5-HT in blood may be involved in IBS pathogenesis. However, there were no significant differences in SCFAs in feces between IBS patients and HCs. But the study did not differentiate between subgroups of IBS. These findings might provide insight for future studies of the BGM axis in the pathogenesis of IBS.

37247177,Fecal microbiota transplant delivered via invasive routes in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) results in significant loss of quality of life. Management guidelines do not recommend fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for IBS based on weak evidence as refined data is lacking. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the pooled clinical outcomes of FMT in IBS, delivered via invasive routes.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched through January 2023 to identify studies that reported on FMT treatment in IBS by invasive routes. Standard meta-analysis methodology using the random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2% and 95% predication interval.
RESULTS: Five studies were included. As many as 377 IBS patients were assessed, of which 238 received FMT and 139 received placebo. One study used nasojejunal tubes, one esophagogastroduodenoscopy and three colonoscopy for FMT delivery. FMT via colonoscopy was performed as a one-time procedure instilled into the cecum. Two studies used 30 g of stool from a single universal donor and one study used 50-80 g of pooled donor feces. The pooled odds ratio of improvement in IBS symptoms with FMT was significantly better as compared to that of placebo OR = 2.9 (95% CI [1.6-5.2, I2 = 62%, p < 0.001]). This was true for studies that exclusively used colonoscopy (OR = 2.1 [1.1-4.2, p = 0.04]). In the FMT arm, 10 patients (10.6%) reported abdomen pain and worsening of symptoms with bloating and six patients (6.3%) reported diarrhea.
CONCLUSION: FMT delivered via invasive routes, especially colonoscopy, demonstrated significant improvement in IBS symptoms. A single FMT consisting of 30 g or more of single universal donor feces instilled into the cecum is the predominant modality.",Mohan BP; Loganathan P; Khan SR; Garg G; Muthusamy A; Ponnada S; Pasam RT; Chandan S; Tuteja A,2023,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,42,3,315-323,10.1007/s12664-023-01373-5,"Mohan, B.

38590140,Review article: A practical approach to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease in remission.,"BACKGROUND: Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are prevalent in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), even when endoscopic remission is reached. These symptoms can have profound negative effects on the quality of life of affected patients and can be difficult to treat. They may be caused by IBD-related complications or comorbid disorders, but they can also be explained by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms.
AIMS: To provide a practical step-by-step guide to diagnose and treat persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBD in remission via a personalised approach.
METHODS: We scrutinised relevant literature on causes, diagnostics and treatment of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, abdominal distension, diarrhoea, constipation and faecal incontinence) in patients with IBD in remission.
RESULTS: A graphical practical guide for several steps in diagnosing, identifying potential triggers and adequate treatment of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in IBD in remission is provided based on supporting literature. The first part of this review focuses on the diagnostic and treatment approaches for potential IBD-related complications and comorbidities. The second part describes the approach to IBS-like symptoms in IBD in remission.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in IBD in remission can be traced back to potential pathophysiological mechanisms in individual patients and can be treated adequately. For both IBD-related complications and comorbidities and IBS-like symptoms in IBD in remission, pharmacological, dietary, lifestyle or psychological treatments can be effective. A systematic and personalised approach is required to reduce the burden for patients, healthcare systems, and society.",Aliu A; Bosch DHCA; Keszthelyi D; Rezazadeh Ardabili A; Colombel JF; Sawyer R; Törnblom H; Hart A; Jonkers DMAE; Pierik MJ; Mujagic Z,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,59,12,1470-1488,10.1111/apt.17988,"Aliu, A., Bosch, D.

34371973,Effect of Low FODMAPs Diet on Irritable Bowel Syndromes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials.,"We conducted a meta-analysis exploring the effect of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols diet (LFD) on the overall symptoms, quality of life, and stool habits of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects method. The effect size was presented as weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the potential effects of covariates on the outcome. Twenty-two papers were included. The LFD group showed a moderate reduction in symptom severity and a slight improvement in quality of life compared to the control group (SMD, -0.53 and 0.24; 95% CI, -0.68, -0.38 and 0.02, 0.47, respectively). IBS symptom improvement was consistent between subgroups stratified according to proportions of female patients, study durations, IBS subtypes, assessment methods, and control interventions. Three studies regarding stool habits change in IBS-D patients showed a significant decrease in stool frequency (mean differences [MD], -5.56/week; 95% CI, -7.40, -3.72) and a significant improvement in stool consistency (MD, -0.86; 95% CI, -1.52, -0.19) in the LFD group compared to the control group.

40134805,Improvement of irritable bowel syndrome with glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a severe gastrointestinal condition with symptoms like pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, have been found to affect gut motility. GLP-1 and its analog ROSE-010 have been shown to inhibit the migrating motor complex and decrease gastrointestinal motility in IBS patients.
AIM: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in providing pain and symptom relief for individuals with IBS.
METHODS: The study conducted extensive searches across various databases, including Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, to identify studies on IBS and related drugs. A search strategy using keywords and medical subject heading terms (MeSH) was developed to ensure inclusivity. Exclusion criteria included non-English language studies, books, conference papers, case reports, in vitro studies, animal studies, and non-original articles.
RESULTS: The study found that ROSE-010 (100 μg) significantly lowered pain intensity in IBS patients compared to a placebo, with an overall odds ratio of 2.30, 95% CI: 1.53-3.46. ROSE-010 (300 μg) is more effective than a placebo for all irritable bowel syndrome subtypes, with consistent effects across trials. ROSE-010 is linked to a greater incidence of nausea, vomiting, and headache than placebo.
CONCLUSION: ROSE-010, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has been shown to reduce pain in individuals with IBS. However, its higher frequency of nausea, vomiting, and headache suggests the need for close monitoring and individualized treatment plans. Further investigation is needed to understand its impact on different IBS subtypes and long-term effects.

35769556,"Eosinophils, Hypoxia-Inducible Factors, and Barrier Dysfunction in Functional Dyspepsia.","Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a highly prevalent disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), previously known as a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Characterized by early satiety, postprandial fullness, and/or epigastric pain or burning, diagnosis depends on positive symptomatology and exclusion of obvious structural diseases. A subtle inflammatory phenotype has been identified in FD patients, involving an increase in duodenal mucosal eosinophils, and imbalances in the duodenal gut microbiota. A dysregulated epithelial barrier has also been well described in FD and is thought to be a contributing factor to the low-grade duodenal inflammation observed, however the mechanisms underpinning this are poorly understood. One possible explanation is that alterations in the microbiota and increased immune cells can result in the activation of cellular stress response pathways to perpetuate epithelial barrier dysregulation. One such cellular response pathway involves the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). HIF, a transcriptional protein involved in the cellular recognition and adaptation to hypoxia, has been identified as a critical component of various pathologies, from cancer to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While the contribution of HIF to subtle inflammation, such as that seen in FD, is unknown, HIF has been shown to have roles in regulating the inflammatory response, particularly the recruitment of eosinophils, as well as maintaining epithelial barrier structure and function. As such, we aim to review our present understanding of the involvement of eosinophils, barrier dysfunction, and the changes to the gut microbiota including the potential pathways and mechanisms of HIF in FD. A combination of PubMed searches using the Mesh terms functional dyspepsia, functional gastrointestinal disorders, disorders of gut-brain interaction, duodenal eosinophilia, barrier dysfunction, gut microbiota, gut dysbiosis, low-grade duodenal inflammation, hypoxia-inducible factors (or HIF), and/or intestinal inflammation were undertaken in the writing of this narrative review to ensure relevant literature was included. Given the findings from various sources of literature, we propose a novel hypothesis involving a potential role for HIF in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FD.",Hari S; Burns GL; Hoedt EC; Keely S; Talley NJ,2022,Frontiers in allergy,3,,851482,10.3389/falgy.2022.851482,"Hari, S., Burns, G.

However, no clear conclusion has been reported yet. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand the association between IBS and alexithymia.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search on the medical databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus using predefined keywords to identify observational studies assessing the association between IBS and alexithymia. The included studies diagnosed IBS using the Rome criteria, and alexithymia was evaluated using the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) score. We used The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of included studies. The primary summary outcome was the mean difference in TAS-20 scores.
RESULTS: We included 7 studies involving 1,513 individuals in our qualitative analysis, with 6 of them included in our quantitative analysis. All studies were considered to be of satisfactory quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria. We found significantly higher TAS-20 scores in IBS patients compared to controls (8.063 [95% CI, 2.554-13.572]). However, no significant mean difference in TAS-20 scores was observed in IBS vs inflammatory bowel disease patients (0.884 [95% CI -2.536-4.304]).

Mendelian randomization (MR) studies provide valuable insight into the causal relationship between an exposure and disease outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of causal inference studies that apply MR approaches to assess the role of these micronutrients, particularly VD, in COVID-19 risk, infection severity, and related inflammatory markers.
DATA SOURCES: Searches (up to July 2023) were conducted in 4 databases.
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: The quality of the studies was evaluated based on the MR-STROBE guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted where possible.
RESULTS: There were 28 studies (2 overlapped) including 12 on micronutrients (8 on VD) and COVID-19, 4 on micronutrients (all on VD) and inflammation, and 12 on inflammatory markers and COVID-19. Some of these studies reported significant causal associations between VD or other micronutrients (vitamin C, vitamin B6, iron, zinc, copper, selenium, and magnesium) and COVID-19 outcomes. Associations in terms of causality were also nonsignificant with regard to inflammation-related markers, except for VD levels below 25 nmol/L and C-reactive protein (CRP). Some studies reported causal associations between cytokines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other inflammatory markers and COVID-19. Pooled MR estimates showed that VD was not significantly associated with COVID-19 outcomes, whereas ACE2 increased COVID-19 risk (MR odds ratio = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.19) but did not affect hospitalization or severity of the disease. The methodological quality of the studies was high in 13 studies, despite the majority (n = 24) utilizing 2-sample MR and evaluated pleiotropy.
CONCLUSION: MR studies exhibited diversity in their approaches but do not support a causal link between VD/micronutrients and COVID-19 outcomes. Whether inflammation mediates the VD-COVID-19 relationship remains uncertain, and highlights the need to address this aspect in future MR studies exploring micronutrient associations with COVID-19 outcomes.

33189181,The overlap between irritable bowel syndrome and organic gastrointestinal diseases.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habit. This condition is one of the most frequent reasons to seek a gastroenterology consultation in primary and secondary care. The diagnosis of IBS is made by identifying characteristic symptoms, as defined by the Rome criteria, and excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases that might otherwise explain these symptoms. Organic conditions that can be mistaken for IBS include coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and, in those with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms, chronic gastrointestinal infections, microscopic colitis, and primary bile acid diarrhoea. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth being associated with IBS is shrouded with controversy and uncertainty, mainly because of invalid tests due to poor sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions. There is insufficient evidence to link IBS-type symptoms with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, since both are hampered by conflicting data. Finally, there is growing appreciation that IBS can present in patients with known but stable organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as quiescent IBD or coeliac disease. Recognising functional gut symptoms in these individuals is paramount so that potentially harmful escalations in immunosuppressive therapy can be avoided and attention can be focused on addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction. This Review endeavours to aid clinicians who practise adult gastroenterology in recognising the potential overlap between IBS and organic gastrointestinal diseases and highlights areas in need of further research and clarity.",Aziz I; Simrén M,2021,The lancet.

38431786,Efficacy of mast cell directed therapies in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Lately, mast cells (MCs) are increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of mast cell directed therapies in reducing the main symptoms of IBS: abdominal pain and changes in stool frequency or consistency.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus were searched until December 19, 2022. Trials evaluating the efficacy of mast cell directed therapies, compared to placebo or any form of control group, were included. Trial selection was performed in two stages: screening titles and abstracts and reviewing full papers identified as relevant, taking into account the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified a total of 1.384 citations. Eleven trials on 943 IBS patients and 197 controls were included: ten randomized controlled trials, two of which cross-over trials, and one cohort study. Of the 11 studies included in the systematic review, only three studies were found to be at low risk of bias. This limited evidence suggests a significant overall improvement in the key symptoms after treatment with disodium cromoglycate, ebastine, ketotifen or palmitoylethanolamide-polydatin compared to control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Mast cell modulating therapies could be of significant value in therapy for IBS patients.

39946356,The effect of acupuncture on quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used to improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients in clinical settings. However, the effect of acupuncture on QoL in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on the QoL of patients with IBS.
METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and Web of Science were screened from inception to September 2023. RCTs published in English comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, usual care, pharmacological interventions, or other therapies were analyzed for QoL in patients with IBS. The primary outcome was QoL and secondary outcomes were the IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) and abdominal pain. The Cochrane Collaboration recommendations were used to assess the risk of bias.
FINDINGS: Fourteen articles with 2,038 participants were included. The pooled result showed acupuncture can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBS compared to the conventional treatment (MD = 6.62, 95% CI, 2.30 to 10.94, P<0.001, I2 = 72.45%). Additionally, acupuncture was superior to other interventions in relieving the symptoms' severity of IBS (MD = -46.58, 95% CI, -91.49 to -1.68, P<0.001, I2 = 90.76%). Nevertheless, acupuncture was not associated with abdominal pain reduction (MD = -0.35, 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.20, P = 0.21, I2 = 0.00%). Lower adverse events were observed in the acupuncture group. Thus, the quality of this study was relatively high.
CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture improves QoL and symptom severity in patients with IBS and that the optimal parameters for acupuncture to improve QoL in patients with IBS are 30 minutes of acupuncture per session, less than or equal to five sessions per week, and a 4-week course of treatment. However, more high-quality clinical trials are needed to provide stronger evidence.",Zhou J; Lamichhane N; Xu Z; Wang J; Quynh VD; Huang J; Gao F; Zhao M; Chen Z; Zhao T,2025,PloS one,20,2,e0314678,10.1371/journal.pone.0314678,"Zhou, J., Lamichhane, N., Xu, Z., Wang, J., Quynh, V.

34592369,The neglected role of Blastocystis sp. and Giardia lamblia in development of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The possible role of Blastocystis sp. and Giardia lamblia infections in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has long been controversial. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether these protozoan infections are associated with IBS development. We systematically searched international databases for all studies that reported these protozoa in IBS patients published by May 10, 2021. Studies were included in the review if they were observational studies with confirmed patients with IBS (in case-control and cross-sectional studies) or parasitic infections (cohort studies) with an appropriate control group. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis model for included studies. A total of 32 papers (42 datasets), including 29 papers (31 datasets) for Blastocystis sp./IBS and 11 papers (11 datasets) for G. lamblia/IBS met the eligibility criteria. Our results indicated that the individuals with Blastocystis sp. infection were significantly at a higher risk of IBS development (OR, 1.78; 95%CI, 1.29-2.44). Moreover, cohort studies indicated a significant positive association between G. lamblia infection and IBS risk (OR, 5.47; 95%CI, 4.23-7.08); while an increasing but no statistically significant risk was observed in case-control studies (OR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.75-1.87). Our findings suggested that Blastocystis sp. and G. lamblia infections are associated with the increased risk of developing IBS. Despite these results, further studies are needed to determine the effect of these protozoa on IBS development.",Abedi SH; Fazlzadeh A; Mollalo A; Sartip B; Mahjour S; Bahadory S; Taghipour A; Rostami A,2022,Microbial pathogenesis,162,,105215,10.1016/j.micpath.2021.105215,"Abedi, S.

33909790,INTERVENTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME: A REVIEW OF COCHRANE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex gastrointestinal disorder, whose understanding is relatively uncertain, and the treatment guidance decision still represents a challenge.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and critically appraise systematic reviews (SRs) published in the Cochrane Database of SRs (CDSR) on the effects of interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for the treatment of IBS.
METHODS: The search was conducted at the Cochrane Library in May 2020. The methodological quality of the SRs was evaluated by the AMSTAR-2 tool.
RESULTS: Eight SRs with moderate to high quality were included, which addressed the treatments: (a) pharmacological: volume agents, antispasmodics, antidepressants and tegaserod; and (b) non-pharmacological: homeopathy, acupuncture, phytotherapy, biofeedback, psychological interventions and hypnotherapy. The results were favorable to antispasmodic drugs and antidepressants regarding the improvement of clinical symptoms. There was no difference between volume agents or tegaserod when compared to placebo. Acupuncture and homeopathy showed a little improvement in symptoms compared to placebo, but the certainty of this evidence was considered low to very low. Psychological interventions seem to improve the overall assessment of the patient and relief symptoms such as abdominal pain. However, there was no long-term follow-up of these patients. The results of the other treatments were considered uncertain due to the high risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: Considering the low quality of the studies included in the SRs, pharmacological treatment with antispasmodics and antidepressants seems to be beneficial for patients with IBS. Among non-pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions seem to be beneficial. However, further clinical trials are recommended with greater methodological rigor to prove these findings.",Scaciota ACL; Matos D; Rosa MMB; Colovati MES; Bellotto EFBC; Martimbianco ALC,2021,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,58,1,120-126,10.1590/S0004-2803.202100000-20,"Scaciota, A.

35546472,Vitamin D status in irritable bowel syndrome and the impact of supplementation on symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: latest studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is related to the occurrence of irritable bowel disease (IBS), and taking vitamin D as a supplement can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel disease. However, clinical treatment of irritable bowel disease with vitamin D is controversial. Objective: we conducted a meta-analysis of all clinical trials to evaluate the associations between vitamin D and irritable bowel disease. Methods: we screened all randomized controlled trials that were published before December 20, 2021 from the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Central, and Clinical Trial. We used RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 16.1 to analyze the relevant data. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was used to report effect sizes. Serum vitamin D concentration, risk of vitamin D deficiency among patients with IBS, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Quality of Life (QoL) score are the main endpoint outcomes in this study. Results: data from twelve clinical trials with 1331 IBS patients were included. Patients with IBS have relatively low vitamin D levels in their serum. Vitamin D supplementation improves the Quality of Life (QoL) score but has no significant effect on the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. Serum vitamin D levels decreased in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and vitamin D supplementation could improve patient quality of life.",Bin Y; Kang L; Lili Y,2022,Nutricion hospitalaria,39,5,1144-1152,10.20960/nh.04044,"Bin, Y., Kang, L., & Lili, Y.

31674057,Herbal medicine in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The efficacy of herbal medicines (HMs) for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD) and functional constipation (FC) is controversial. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to determine their effectiveness for FGIDs.
METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases till July 2019 with English language restriction: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PUBMED. Randomized double-blind controlled trials of HMs compared with placebo or conventional pharmacological drugs for adult FGIDs patients were included.
RESULTS: In total, 49 trials involving 7396 participants with FGIDs were included. The risk of bias was low in 9, unclear in 36, and high in 4 trials. More than 33 different herbal formulae were tested. HMs demonstrated statistically significant benefits for symptom improvement compared with placebo in 46 trials (RR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.48-1.88). When compared with conventional pharmacological therapy in 5 trials, HMs were found to be non-inferior (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18). The number of trials with regards to FD, IBS and FC were 19, 23 and 7 respectively. Subgroup analysis found that HMs were better than placebo in alleviating symptoms for FD (RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.69), IBS (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.32-1.97) and FC (RR = 3.83, 95% CI 2.26-6.50). HMs tended to have more patients with adverse events than placebo, but similar to conventional pharmacological drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a positive signal for HMs as a potentially well-tolerated and effective treatment for FGIDs, deserving further examination in high-quality trials.",Tan N; Gwee KA; Tack J; Zhang M; Li Y; Chen M; Xiao Y,2020,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,35,4,544-556,10.1111/jgh.14905,"Tan, N., Gwee, K.

31750966,A meta-analysis on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with different subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Enteric microbiota is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The reported prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in subjects with IBS is highly variable, and there is no consensus on the role of SIBO in different subtypes of IBS, and indications and methods of testing.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed for studies applying tests for SIBO in subjects with IBS. After applying prospectively decided exclusion criteria, the eligible papers were examined using a meta-analysis approach for the prevalence of SIBO in subjects with IBS using different tests. The odds ratios of SIBO among subjects with IBS as compared with healthy controls using different tests were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the available studies (22, 17, 5, and 3 using lactulose and glucose hydrogen breath tests [LHBT and GHBT], jejunal aspirate culture, and more than one tests, respectively) meeting the inclusion criteria, 36.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.2-44.6) had a positive test for SIBO. Patients with IBS were 2.6 (95% CI 1.3-6.9) and 8.3 (95% CI 3.0-5.9) times more likely to have a positive test for SIBO as compared with healthy controls using GHBT and jejunal aspirate culture, respectively. Patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS were more likely to have positive GHBT as compared with the other subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS were more likely to have SIBO as compared with healthy subjects using GHBT and jejunal aspirate culture but not using LHBT.

39760236,The Developmental Origins of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) framework contends that chronic diseases are attributable to behavioral and environmental risks encountered during vital periods of fetal and childhood development. Clinical research investigating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) largely focuses on adult risk factors, with emerging evidence of epigenetic contributions. Limited work considers potential childhood exposures. This paper applies a life course approach to the study of IBS, exploring the available evidence to ascertain the potential developmental origins of IBS.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted adhering to MOOSE and PRISMA protocols, identifying papers from 1970 through April 2024 examining all IBS risk factors during the prenatal, postnatal, childhood, and adolescent periods. Data were extracted from screened papers and analyzed via meta-analysis using a random effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 27 case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies were identified for analysis. The meta-analysis revealed significant childhood risk factors for adult IBS, including family history (pooled OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.89-2.49, p < 0.0001, n = 11) and the occurrence of any childhood trauma event (pooled OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.29-2.01, p < 0.0001, n = 6). Physical and sexual trauma were the strongest trauma predictors. Factors including breastfeeding and Cesarean section were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found IBS is strongly predicted by traumatic childhood experiences, as well as having an immediate family member with IBS. These demonstrated environmental and genetic components indicate a potential gene-environment interaction during childhood, suggesting a need for primary research to better understand the developmental origins of IBS.",Lenover Moyer MB; Jasani K; Waldman AB; Chinchilli VM; Shenk MK,2025,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,37,1,e24209,10.1002/ajhb.24209,"Lenover Moyer, M.

39865330,Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Asian Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been gradually increasing throughout Asia, incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Asia is relatively lower than that in Western and is not well known. This study aimed to evaluate incidence of VTE in Asian IBD patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Studies were identified through literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases (from inception inclusive April 2024) for English studies. The criteria for selecting participants were as follows: (1) studies including patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis in the Asian population; (2) comparisons were specified as with control group of non-IBD patients for comparative incidence; and (3) outcomes were measured by relative risks (RRs) and hazard risk for VTE incidence in nationwide cohort studies. Three independent reviewers extracted published data using standardized procedure in accordance with the reporting guidelines. A fixed-effects model was used to estimate pooled effect sizes. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify the potential moderating effects of VTE risk in IBD patients.
RESULTS: Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled RR for overall VTE incidence in Asian IBD patients compared with that in non-IBD patients was 2.065 (95% CI: 1.905-2.238). There was no statistical moderating effect of the variables (mean age, female rate, CD proportion, and country) on the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, VTE incidence in Asian IBD patients was higher than that in non-IBD patients. It seemed reasonable to consider prophylaxis for VTE in hospitalized IBD patients.",Song JH; Shim SR; Kim DS; Koo HS; Huh KC,2025,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,40,4,774-782,10.1111/jgh.16888,"Song, J.

40272527,Systematic review and meta-analysis of cytomegalovirus-associated adverse outcomes and healthcare resource utilization in hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"PURPOSE: Serious complications and unplanned healthcare utilization are reported among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) hospitalizations with associated cytomegalovirus (CMV). The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the in-hospital outcomes of CMV-related hospitalization in IBD patients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched in PubMed, Web of Science (ISI), Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar until February 2024. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics were applied to evaluate potential heterogeneity across eligible studies. The random-effects model obtained pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: Sixteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing 5120 IBD patients diagnosed with comorbid CMV infection. Our findings indicated that compared to IBD patients without CMV, those with both CMV and IBD had a longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (8.65 days longer; 95% CI: 6.96, 10.34; P < 0.01), a greater colectomy risk (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.53, 3.34; P < 0.01), and higher in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.83; 95% CI: 1.92, 4.16; P < 0.01). However, the difference in hospital charges between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.78). Sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out approach revealed significant changes in hospital costs after excluding certain studies. Additionally, subgroup analyses showed significant differences based on IBD subtypes for surgery risk and LOS.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CMV infection is associated with poorer outcomes in hospitalized IBD patients, highlighting the importance of early detection and appropriate management of CMV infection in this population to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare resource utilization.",Gholami Shahrebabak M; Kouchaki H; Gholami Shahrebabak A; Ravankhah M; Abdollahi M; Akbari M; Lankarani KB,2025,International journal of colorectal disease,40,1,101,10.1007/s00384-025-04886-x,"Gholami Shahrebabak, M., Kouchaki, H., Gholami Shahrebabak, A., Ravankhah, M., Abdollahi, M., Akbari, M., & Lankarani, K.

35812241,Metabolomics: The Key to Unraveling the Role of the Microbiome in Visceral Pain Neurotransmission.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, is a relapsing and remitting disease of the gastrointestinal tract, presenting with chronic inflammation, ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Up to 80% of patients suffering from IBD experience acute pain, which dissipates when the underlying inflammation and tissue damage resolves. However, despite achieving endoscopic remission with no signs of ongoing intestinal inflammation or damage, 30-50% of IBD patients in remission experience chronic abdominal pain, suggesting altered sensory neuronal processing in this disorder. Furthermore, effective treatment for chronic pain is limited such that 5-25% of IBD outpatients are treated with narcotics, with associated morbidity and mortality. IBD patients commonly present with substantial alterations to the microbial community structure within the gastrointestinal tract, known as dysbiosis. The same is also true in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic disorder characterized by altered bowel habits and abdominal pain, in the absence of inflammation. An emerging body of literature suggests that the gut microbiome plays an important role in visceral hypersensitivity. Specific microbial metabolites have an intimate relationship with host receptors that are highly expressed on host cell and neurons, suggesting that microbial metabolites play a key role in visceral hypersensitivity. In this review, we will discuss the techniques used to analysis the metabolome, current potential metabolite targets for visceral hypersensitivity, and discuss the current literature that evaluates the role of the post-inflammatory microbiota and metabolites in visceral hypersensitivity.",Shute A; Bihan DG; Lewis IA; Nasser Y,2022,Frontiers in neuroscience,16,,917197,10.3389/fnins.2022.917197,"Shute, A., Bihan, D.

The scrambled sentences task as a measure of interpretation biases in psychopathology: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The Scrambled Sentences Task (SST) is frequently used to assess interpretation biases (IBs). However, neither the range of its applications nor the quality of the empirical evidence it provides has been systematically examined. This systematic review investigates the types of samples and disorders in which the SST has been applied and evaluates its psychometric properties via a meta-analysis. The databases PubMed and EBSCOhost (including PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PSYNDEX, MEDLINE) were examined (last search: September 2021) and 93 studies from 91 manuscripts were included. Results showed that the SST has been applied predominantly in unselected samples or those with elevated levels of subsyndromal symptoms, with about a third of the studies employing the SST in a clinical population. While the SST was initially developed to assess depression-related IBs, it has now been extended to other disorders, in particular anxiety disorders. Results of the meta-analyses indicated good convergent validity and reliability across disorders, albeit in the context of substantial heterogeneity. Findings concerning divergent validity were mixed with high correlations across disorders between the SST and trait anxiety in particular, questioning its specificity.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of ustekinumab for pCD in a systemic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Studies describing the efficacy of ustekinumab on fistulas in pCD in PubMed and EMBASE database from inception until 22 September 2020, were assessed in a systemic review and meta-analysis. The random-effect model was applied for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The systematic review of the current literature yielded 2,243 studies of which nine studies with a total of 396 patients were found eligible for inclusion. The pooled proportions of patients experiencing fistula response were 41.0% (95% CI 23.9-60.6%9), I 2 = 85%, 39.7% (95% CI 24.3-57.4%), I 2 = 69% and 55.9% (95% CI 40.8-69.9%, I 2 = 67% at weeks 8, 24, and 52, respectively.

RESULTS: Seven RCTs with 441 participants were included, from which the meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotic supplementation has a significant effect on reducing abdominal pain in pediatric patients with IBS (WMD = - 2.36; 95% CI - 4.12 to - 0.60; P = 0.009). Although our study involved children and adolescents (≤ 18 years), the effects of probiotic supplementation seem to be more potent in patients under 10 years old (WMD = - 2.55; 95% CI - 2.84 to - 2.27) compared to patients aged 10-18 years (WMD = - 1.70; 95% CI - 2.18 to - 1.22). The length of supplementation longer than four weeks was more effective (WMD = - 2.43; 95% CI - 2.76 to - 2.09).

37373082,Do Colonic Mucosal Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Levels Play a Role in Diverticular Disease? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Diverticular disease (DD) is the most frequent condition in the Western world that affects the colon. Although chronic mild inflammatory processes have recently been proposed as a central factor in DD, limited information is currently available regarding the role of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to assess the mucosal TNF-α levels in DD. We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to identify observational studies assessing the TNF-α levels in DD. Full-text articles that satisfied our inclusion and exclusion criteria were included, and a quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The principal summary outcome was the mean difference (MD). The results were reported as MD (95% confidence interval (CI)). A total of 12 articles involving 883 subjects were included in the qualitative synthesis, out of which 6 studies were included in our quantitative synthesis. We did not observe statistical significance related to the mucosal TNF-α levels in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) vs. the controls (0.517 (95% CI -1.148-2.182)), and symptomatic vs. asymptomatic DD patients (0.657 (95% CI -0.883-2.196)). However, the TNF-α levels were found to be significantly increased in DD compared to irritable bowel disease (IBS) patients (27.368 (95% CI 23.744-30.992)), and segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) vs. IBS patients (25.303 (95% CI 19.823-30.784)). Between SUDD and the controls, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic DD, there were no significant differences in the mucosal TNF-α levels. However, the TNF-α levels were considerably higher in DD and SCAD patients than IBS patients. Our findings suggest that TNF-α may play a key role in the pathogenesis of DD in specific subgroups and could potentially be a target for future therapies.",Sabo CM; Ismaiel M; Ismaiel A; Leucuta DC; Popa SL; Grad S; Dumitrascu DL,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,12,,10.3390/ijms24129934,"Sabo, C.

AIMS: To perform a meta-analysis regarding vedolizumab as first line of biological therapy for UC or CD.
METHODS: A systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases per December 2020 was undertaken. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models.
RESULTS: This systematic review identified 79 eligible studies with 4,520 and 3,494 bio-naïve patients with UC and CD, respectively, and 8,105 and 11,140 bio-exposed patients. Among bio-naïve patients with UC, a total of 40.0% (95%CI 27.0-54.0, I2=86%) and 63.9% (95%CI 47.0-79.2, I2=36%) achieved clinical remission at weeks 14 and 52, respectively. The corresponding rates in CD were 54.0% (95%CI 42.0-66.0, I2=23%), and 61.7% (95%CI 55.2-68.1, I2=0%). Bio-naïvety was associated with a higher probability of clinical remission at week 52 in UC (relative risk (RR)=1.32 (95%CI 1.14-1.53)), while this was only apparent until week 26 in CD (RR=1.60 (95%CI 1.30-1.95)). Finally, bio-naïve UC patients had a lower risk of serious adverse events (RR=0.29 (95%CI 0.09-0.95)).

38191358,The effectiveness of continuity of care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of continuity of care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
BACKGROUND: The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) is increasing by years, especially in China. Moreover, IBD is prolonged and difficult to heal, which seriously impairs the quality of life of patients. Some studies have identified that continuity of care could contribute to the improvement of the quality of life, but the results remains inconclusive in patients with IBD.
METHODS: PRISMA guidelines was the outline of this study. Review Manager Software (version 5.3) was used to carry out the data analysis. Outcome assessments included quality of life (QoL), remission rates, number of outpatient clinic visits, and medication adherence.
RESULTS: Ultimately, 12 studies involving 2415 patients were brought into this meta-analysis. The results indicated there was no significant difference for continuity of care to improve the QoL in intervention group (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI: -0.08, 0.12). Besides, the remission rates of disease had no difference with those patients in the two groups (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.60). However, continued care could contribute to the number of outpatient clinic visits (MD = -0.84, 95% CI: -1.19, -0.49) and patients' adherence to medication significantly (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.95).
CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients could benefited from continuity of care with reducing their number of clinic visits and improving medication adherence. Nonetheless, there was no evidence of continuity of care contribute to QoL and remission of disease for these patients.",Gu Z; Gu J; Liu P,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,24,10.1186/s12876-023-03109-3,"Gu, Z., Gu, J., & Liu, P.

39091663,Acceptance and commitment therapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common treatment modality for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CBT may not be a good fit for all patients and some may instead benefit from an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) approach. This narrative review presents evidence for the use of ACT in adult patients with IBS or IBD. The authors also suggest instances in which patients with IBS or IBD may benefit from ACT and discuss future directions of research.
METHODS: Between August 2023 and January 2024, databases such as Google Scholar, institutional libraries, and PubMed were used to review the literature on ACT in patients with IBS and IBD. A variety of search terms were included. Non-English, pediatric, and studies that did not employ a full ACT protocol were excluded.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: ACT for IBS studies typically utilized a self-help book or a one-day workshop intervention, with results indicating reductions in IBS and mood symptoms and improvements in quality of life. Within IBD, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) tested the impact of ACT, two of which found reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited number of studies testing a full ACT protocol in patient populations with IBS or IBD, results indicate potential efficacy in managing not only symptoms, but also facets of quality of life. Future studies should utilize robust experimental designs and comprehensively test the effectiveness of ACT in IBS and IBD patient populations with both process and outcome measures.",Marchese SH; Naftaly JP; Pandolfino J,2024,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,9,,43,10.21037/tgh-24-10,"Marchese, S.

31617016,Sarcopenia as an independent predictor of the surgical outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk of sarcopenia, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We conducted this study to assess whether sarcopenia predicts the need for surgery and postoperative complications in patients with IBD. We performed a systematic search of four electronic databases, last updated in March, 2019. Data from studies comparing rates of surgery and postoperative complications in sarcopenic IBD patients versus non-sarcopenic IBD patients were pooled with the random-effects models. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Ten studies with a collective total of 885 IBD patients were included in our meta-analysis. Although the analysis of raw data did not reveal significant differences between the two groups with respect to the rate of surgery and postoperative complications (OR = 1.826; 95% CI 0.913-3.654; p = 0.089 and OR = 3.265; 95% CI 0.575-18.557; p = 0.182, respectively), the analysis of adjusted data identified sarcopenia as an independent predictor for both of the undesirable outcomes (OR = 2.655; 95% CI 1.121-6.336; p = 0.027 and OR = 6.097; 95% CI 1.756-21.175; p = 0.004, respectively).

34755926,Oral and parenteral anti-neuropathic agents for the management of pain and discomfort in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent and economically burdensome condition; and pain is often the most unpleasant, disruptive, and difficult-to-treat symptom. Visceral hypersensitivity is a common feature driving pain in IBS, suggesting that neuropathic mechanisms may be implicated. We conducted a systematic review of available evidence to examine the role of anti-neuropathic medicines in the management of pain in IBS.
METHODS: We systematically searched scientific repositories for trials investigating conventional oral, and/or parenteral, pharmaceutical antineuropathic treatments in patients with IBS. We summarized key participant characteristics, outcomes related to pain (primary outcome), and selected secondary outcomes.
KEY RESULTS: We included 13 studies (n = 629 participants): six investigated amitriptyline, three duloxetine, three pregabalin, and one gabapentin. There was considerable methodological and statistical heterogeneity, so we performed a narrative synthesis and limited meta-analysis. Amitriptyline was most extensively studied, though only in diarrhea-predominant patients. In individual trials, amitriptyline, pregabalin and gabapentin generally appeared beneficial for pain outcomes. While duloxetine studies tended to report improvements in pain, all were un-controlled trials with high risk of bias. Meta-analysis of three studies (n = 278) yielded a pooled relative-risk of 0.50 (95%CI 0.38-0.66) for not improving with anti-neuropathic agent vs control. We did not identify any eligible studies investigating the role of parenteral anti-neuropathics.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Anti-neuropathic analgesics may improve pain in IBS, and deserve further, high-quality investigation, potentially considering parenteral administration and agents with minimal gastrointestinal motility effects. Investigation of amitriptyline's efficacy in non-diarrhea-predominant subtypes is currently lacking, and we recommend particular caution for its use in IBS-C.",Lambarth A; Zarate-Lopez N; Fayaz A,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,1,e14289,10.1111/nmo.14289,"Lambarth, A., Zarate-Lopez, N., & Fayaz, A.

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to March 2021. We performed a random effects meta-analysis of the proportion of adverse events (AEs) in placebo-treated patients with IBS who are involved in parallel-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating pharmacological interventions and evaluated the effect of trial characteristics on the magnitude of the nocebo response rate.
RESULTS: A total of 6,107 studies were identified from the databases. After evaluation, 53 met the eligibility criteria and were included. The overall pooled nocebo response rate was 32% (95% CI: 26-38%). The most commonly reported AEs were headache (9%), nasopharyngitis (7%), abdominal pain (4%), and nausea (4%). The nocebo response rate was low compared with that in the treatment group applying probiotics, antispasmodics, and Traditional Chinese medicine, but high compared with that in antibiotic treatment group. The nocebo rate in patients using diaries to record AEs was lower than the average, and was higher in patients recording through checkup.
DISCUSSION: Patients with IBS have significant nocebo response intensity in clinical trials. Based on findings in this study, we recommend the researchers pay attention to the common AEs and carefully analyze the relation to the intervention.",Li R; Chen F; He X; Feng Y; Pei Q; Wang D; Liu X; Liu J; Hou X; Bai T,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,1018713,10.3389/fmed.2022.1018713,"Li, R., Chen, F., He, X., Feng, Y., Pei, Q., Wang, D., Liu, X., Liu, J., Hou, X., & Bai, T.

39917138,"The Efficacy of the Low-FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) Diet in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently observed in clinical practice and affects people from different parts of the world. The pathogenesis and aetiology are not well-defined or fully understood; however, altered bowel movements, psychological factors, and visceral hypersensitivity may contribute to symptoms via a pathway mediated by serotonin and other enteric neurotransmitters. Altered bowel movements, including diarrhoea and constipation, abdominal pain relieved by passing flatus, and bloating are the main salient features of this condition. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness and efficacy of a low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (low-FODMAP) diet in these patients. Systematic searches were conducted on PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic trials and cohort studies that included keywords about IBS and a low-FODMAP diet were included. Exclusion criteria included studies that were not in the English language, not relevant to IBS, diet-related to inflammatory bowel disease, or not pertinent to the subject. A total of 41 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. There was significant heterogeneity among the RCTs; hence, a random-effects model was used. The systematic review included a total of 8460 patients across 36 studies, with follow-up durations ranging from 11 to 16 months. Specifically, the meta-analysis included 15 RCTs with 1118 participants and follow-up durations from two days to nine weeks and six cohort studies including 292 patients with follow-up durations from two weeks to two years. The risk ratio (RR) was 1.21 (95% confidence interval= 0.98-1.51), and the I2 value ​​​​​was 63% for global symptom improvement with a low-FODMAP diet using a random-effects model. There was a low risk of bias in the RCTs. Five studies were included evaluating the effect of a low-FODMAP diet on quality of life, and these studies did not show any statistically significant benefit of a low-FODMAP diet on quality of life, although a mean difference of 4.59 (95% CI 1.50-7.67) was observed. The risk of bias was moderate to severe in the observational studies included in this review. Food intolerance is increasingly recognised as a contributory factor in IBS, and its role in the pathogenesis and precipitation of symptoms is being explored. Specific mechanisms include the fermentation of FODMAPs by the gut microbiota, leading to gas production and subsequent symptoms.",Khan Z; Muhammad SA; Amin MS; Gul A,2025,Cureus,17,1,e77053,10.7759/cureus.77053,"Khan, Z., Muhammad, S.

39780334,Probiotics Combined With Trimebutine for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics combined with trimebutine in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), addressing an important gap in current treatment strategies.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of trimebutine combined with probiotics for the treatment of IBS were collected from various databases. All retrieved articles were screened and assessed for quality. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed following the guidelines recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The meta-analysis of the included studies was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software.
RESULTS: A total of 37 RCTs involving 4360 participants were included in this study. Among them, the treatment group consisted of 2177 participants, and the control group consisted of 2183 participants. The results showed that the overall efficacy of trimebutine combined with probiotics in the treatment of IBS was significantly higher than that of trimebutine alone (odds ratio [OR] = 5.09, 95 % confidence interval [CI] [4.19, 6.20], p < 0.00001). The effective rate in the combination therapy group was 93.5 % compared with 73.8 % in the trimebutine alone group. The safety profile was favorable, with adverse event rates of 1.75 % and 1.69 % in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. The most common adverse events were mild and included dry mouth, nausea and dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported in either group. Subgroup analysis based on the type of probiotic intervention showed that combination use was better than trimebutine alone, and the differences between each subgroup were statistically significant. Combination use of compound Lactobacillus capsules had the best effect (OR = 16.03, 95 % CI [4.57, 56.21], p < 0.0001]. These results highlight the potential role of strain-specific benefits in IBS treatment and suggest that probiotic strain selection may significantly influence treatment outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of trimebutine and probiotics is more effective in the treatment of IBS compared with trimebutine alone.

40375116,Influence of the metabolic and inflammatory profile in patients with frozen shoulder - systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Frozen Shoulder (FS), also known as adhesive shoulder capsulitis, is characterized by a fibrotic inflammatory process of unknown origin, with the most prominent symptoms being pain, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility.
METHODS: The systematic review and meta-analysis presented herein provide insights into the pathogenesis of this condition, as well as common metabolic biomarkers potentially implicated in FS, such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Dyslipidemia and hormonal factors, such as thyroid dysfunctions, are also examined.
RESULTS: A total of 7,499 individuals were included in the meta-analysis, and one additional study collected 28,416 blood samples from individuals with FS from biobanks. The meta-analysis of metabolic variables showed that HbA1c was the most significantly elevated marker in FS, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of μ^ = 0.3970 (95% CI: 0.0998 to 0.6943), indicating a moderate effect. Glucose showed a mean difference of -0.28 (95% CI: -0.60 to 0.05), which was not statistically significant, suggesting that short-term fluctuations in glucose levels may not be as relevant as long-term metabolic control. Cholesterol had a standardized difference of 0.278 (95% CI: 0.171 to 0.385), being significantly higher in FS. For triglycerides, the SMD was μ^ = 1.0318 (95% CI: -1.0027 to 3.0664), indicating high heterogeneity and preventing a clear conclusion. Hypothyroidism was also evaluated, with a total SMD of 0.067, a total variance of 0.0021, and a 95% confidence interval of -0.024 to 0.158, confirming no association between FS and thyroid function. Regarding inflammatory biomarkers, IL-1β was the most predominant, showing significantly higher levels in FS, with an SMD of μ^ = 2.2671 (95% CI: 0.5750 to 3.9591). TNF-α had a mean difference of μ^ = 0.7814 (95% CI: 0.1013 to 1.4615), reflecting a significant difference from zero (z = 2.2520, p = 0.0243). Finally, IL-6 did not show a significant association, with an SMD of μ^ = 1.6721 (95% CI: -0.9368 to 4.2810).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis highlights the role of metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of FS. HbA1c and cholesterol were the most associated metabolic biomarkers, while IL-1β and TNF-α showed a strong link to inflammation and fibrosis. The heterogeneity in triglycerides and IL-6 underscores the need for studies with standardized methodologies and subgroup analyses. Future research should focus on biomarker progression, patient stratification, and new therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic and immune modulation, considering FS within a broader metabolic-inflammatory framework to improve its classification and treatment.",Hamed-Hamed D; Rodríguez-Pérez C; Pruimboom L; Navarro-Ledesma S,2025,BMC musculoskeletal disorders,26,1,475,10.1186/s12891-025-08706-9,"Hamed-Hamed, D., Rodríguez-Pérez, C., Pruimboom, L., & Navarro-Ledesma, S.

33733538,"The association between ectopic pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease: A systematic review.","AIM: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease (CeD) more commonly affect women of reproductive age. The aim of our study is to evaluate the association between ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women with IBD, IBS, and CeD.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL from the database inception date through December 31, 2020. Peer-reviewed publications and abstracts written in English, regarding the association between EP and IBD, IBS, and CeD with controls were included. Quality assessment was conducted based on GRADE criteria. Analyses included odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity between studies was presented with I2 .
RESULTS: We included five population-based cohort studies. The odds of EP significantly increased in Crohn's disease (CD), but not ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared to IBD-free controls. The odds of EP significantly increased in IBS as compared to women without IBS. No significant difference was observed for odds of EP in women with and without CeD.

39255349,Self-Perceived Lactose Intolerance Versus Confirmed Lactose Intolerance in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are prevalent, affecting 20-40% of the population, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) being the most common and impactful. While congenital lactose intolerance is rare, lactase deficiency in adults is widespread, causing gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and diarrhea. Self-perceived lactose intolerance often overestimates symptoms, impacting dietary choices and quality of life, necessitating better understanding and management for improved patient outcomes. This article evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of self-reported lactose intolerance in patients with lactose intolerance and IBS through a systematic review.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS, including terms related to IBS, lactose intolerance, and self-reported symptoms, without applying filters to ensure comprehensive coverage. Inclusion criteria focused on observational studies with adult participants diagnosed with lactose intolerance, addressing symptoms and lactose malabsorption, while excluding non-English articles, reviews, editorials, and studies involving pediatric subjects.
RESULTS: The systematic review analyzed six studies with 845 participants, revealing significant variability and moderate accuracy in self-reported lactose intolerance for diagnosing actual lactose intolerance in IBS patients. Hydrogen breath tests (HBTs) showed that self-reported symptoms often led to false positives, underscoring the need for objective diagnostic tools and standardized criteria. The findings highlight the complexity of diagnosing lactose intolerance in IBS patients and suggest that lactose-free diets and routine HBT should not be recommended without clear indications.
CONCLUSIONS: The rigorous selection process ensured the inclusion of high-quality, relevant studies, thereby enhancing the reliability and validity of the review's findings. These studies revealed that a lactose-free diet should not be routinely recommended for IBS patients, nor should the routine use of HBT to identify lactose malabsorption in this group. Future research should focus on better understanding the factors influencing lactose perception and tolerance, which is crucial for more effective management of lactose intolerance in IBS patients.",Pop A; Popa SL; Pop DD; Ismaiel A; Nechita VI; Dumitrascu DL,2024,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,,,,10.15403/jgld-5836,"Pop, A., Popa, S.

40205601,Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis on a global scale.,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be at higher risk of developing MetS due to chronic inflammation, altered adipokine profiles, and the effects of corticosteroid treatment. However, the prevalence of MetS in IBD patients remains inconsistent across studies. This meta-analysis aims to estimate the prevalence of MetS in IBD patients and compare its occurrence between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science from their inception up to January 19, 2025. Eligible observational studies reporting MetS prevalence in IBD patients were included. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via the I2 statistic. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software, version 4.0 was used for analysis.
RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of MetS in IBD patients was 21.8% (95% CI: 14.3-31.6%). The prevalence was higher in UC patients (32.7%, 95% CI: 16.0-55.5%) compared to CD patients (14.1%, 95% CI: 8.6-22.3%). Patients with UC had significantly higher odds of MetS than those with CD (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.85, P = 0.02). Additionally, IBD patients with MetS were significantly older than those without (MD: 9.89, 95% CI: 5.12-14.67, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In summary, this meta-analysis reveals a notable prevalence of MetS among patients with IBD, particularly in those with UC, where the prevalence is higher than in CD. The analysis also shows that IBD patients with MetS tend to be older, suggesting age as a contributing factor. These findings underscore the need for routine metabolic screening in IBD care, especially in UC and elderly patients.",Janani KV; Saberian P; Patel HB; Keetha NR; Etemadzadeh A; Patel A; Hashemi SM; Amini-Salehi E; Gurram A,2025,"Journal of health, population, and nutrition",44,1,112,10.1186/s41043-025-00860-z,"Janani, K.

40511506,Is there a bidirectional relationship between allergic rhinitis and irritable bowel syndrome? A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest a link between allergic rhinitis (AR) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but evidence is insufficient. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between AR and IBS.
METHODS: We searched the relevant literature in six electronic databases. We included a total of nine articles, seven of which took AR as the research object, two of which took IBS as the research object. We performed a meta-analysis using random effects and estimated the resultant odds ratio (OR).
RESULTS: A total of 10 627 patients with AR were included in seven studies, including 956 patients diagnosed with AR in the IBS population and 9671 patients diagnosed with AR in the non-IBS population. By heterogeneity test, X2 = 10.12, F-statistic (F) = 6, P = 0.12, I2 = 41%, OR = 2.88, and Z-score (Z) = 21.97 (P < 0.00001), the results were statistically significant. Patients with AR have an increased risk of developing IBS compared to patients without AR. A total of 1099 patients with IBS were included in two studies, including 384 patients with IBS in AR patients and 715 patients with IBS in the healthy population. After the heterogeneity test, X2 = 0.11, F = 1, P = 0.74, I2 = 0%, OR = 2.15, and Z = 11.81 (P < 0.00001), the results were statistically significant. Patients with IBS have an increased risk of developing AR compared to patients without IBS.
CONCLUSIONS: The bidirectional association between AR and IBS provides a basis for exploring potential new mechanisms between the two.

32989183,"Parental, Perinatal, and Childhood Risk Factors for Development of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Adverse early life experiences are associated with the development of stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory and ischemic heart diseases. These negative experiences may also play a role in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)--a functional gastrointestinal disease. This review discusses the research to date on the parental, perinatal, and childhood risk and protective factors associated with the development of IBS.
METHODS: A literature search was completed for studies published between 1966 and 2018 that investigated premorbid factors occurring during the perinatal and childhood periods as well as parental factors that were associated with the development of IBS.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the review criteria. Risk factors that appeared in more than one study included: (1) parental IBS, substance abuse, parental punishment, and rejection as parental risk factors; (2) low birth weight as a perinatal risk factor; and (3) crowded living conditions in low-income families, childhood anxiety, depression, or child abuse as childhood risk factors. Protective factors for IBS were emotional warmth from the parents and being born to an older mother.
CONCLUSIONS: More effort is needed to identify what fetal and maternal factors are associated with low birth weight and IBS. A well-executed prospective birth cohort with a collection of bio-samples and functional data will provide a better understanding of how adversity and the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and numerous risk factors affect the development of IBS.",Low EXS; Mandhari MNKA; Herndon CC; Loo EXL; Tham EH; Siah KTH,2020,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,26,4,437-446,10.5056/jnm20109,"Low, E.

32610476,Probiotic Strains and Intervention Total Doses for Modulating Obesity-Related Microbiota Dysbiosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Obesity is a growing health threat worldwide. Administration of probiotics in obesity has also parallelly increased but without any protocolization. We conducted a systematic review exploring the administration pattern of probiotic strains and effective doses for obesity-related disorders according to their capacity of positively modulating key biomarkers and microbiota dysbiosis. Manuscripts targeting probiotic strains and doses administered for obesity-related disorders in clinical studies were sought. MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using keywords during the last fifteen years up to April 2020. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and then full-text papers against inclusion criteria according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. From 549 interventional reports identified, we filtered 171 eligible studies, from which 24 full-text assays were used for calculating intervention total doses (ITD) of specific species and strains administered. Nine of these reports were excluded in the second-step because no specific data on gut microbiota modulation was found. Six clinical trials (CT) and 9 animal clinical studies were retained for analysis of complete outcome prioritized (body mass index (BMI), adiposity parameters, glucose, and plasma lipid biomarkers, and gut hormones). Lactobacillus spp. administered were double compared to Bifidobacterium spp.; Lactobacillus as single or multispecies formulations whereas most Bifidobacteria only through multispecies supplementations. Differential factors were estimated from obese populations' vs. obesity-induced animals: ITD ratio of 2 × 106 CFU and patterns of administrations of 11.3 weeks to 5.5 weeks, respectively. Estimation of overall probiotics impact from selected CT was performed through a random-effects model to pool effect sizes. Comparisons showed a positive association between the probiotics group vs. placebo on the reduction of BMI, total cholesterol, leptin, and adiponectin. Moreover, negative estimation appeared for glucose (FPG) and CRP. While clinical trials including data for positive modulatory microbiota capacities suggested that high doses of common single and multispecies of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium ameliorated key obesity-related parameters, the major limitation was the high variability between studies and lack of standardized protocols. Efforts in solving this problem and searching for next-generation probiotics for obesity-related diseases would highly improve the rational use of probiotics.",López-Moreno A; Suárez A; Avanzi C; Monteoliva-Sánchez M; Aguilera M,2020,Nutrients,12,7,,10.3390/nu12071921,"López-Moreno, A., Suárez, A., Avanzi, C., Monteoliva-Sánchez, M., & Aguilera, M.

38970007,A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but have yielded inconsistent results. We updated the short-term and long-term efficacy of FMT in treating IBS, and performed a first-of-its-kind exploration of the relationship between gut microbiota and emotions.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library using various search strategies to identify all eligible studies. The inclusion criteria for data extraction were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) compared to placebo in adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A meta-analysis was then performed to assess the summary relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Out of 3,065 potentially relevant records, a total of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 573 subjects met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The meta-analyses revealed no significant differences in short-term (12 weeks) (RR 0.20, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.44), long-term (52 weeks) global improvement (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.21), besides short-term (12 weeks) (SMD - 48.16, 95% CI -102.13 to 5.81, I2 = 90%) and long-term (24 weeks) (SMD 2.16, 95% CI -60.52 to 64.83, I2 = 68%) IBS-SSS. There was statistically significant difference in short-term improvement of IBS-QoL (SMD 10.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 19.51, I2 = 82%), although there was a high risk of bias. In terms of long-term improvement (24 weeks and 54 weeks), there were no significant differences between the FMT and placebo groups (SMD 7.56, 95% CI 1.60 to 13.52, I2 = 0%; SMD 6.62, 95% CI -0.85 to 14.08, I2 = 0%). Sensitivity analysis indicated that there were visible significant effects observed when the criteria were based on Rome IV criteria (RR 16.48, 95% CI 7.22 to 37.62) and Gastroscopy (RR 3.25, 95%CI 2.37 to 4.47), Colonoscopy (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.05). when using mixed stool FMT based on data from two RCTs, no significant difference was observed (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to -1.34). The remission of depression exhibited no significant difference between the FMT and placebo groups at the 12-week mark (SMD - 0.26, 95% CI -3.09 to 2.58), and at 24 weeks (SMD - 2.26, 95% CI -12.96 to 8.45). Furthermore, major adverse events associated with FMT were transient and self-limiting.
DISCUSSION: Based on the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the current evidence does not support the efficacy of FMT in improving global IBS symptoms in the long term. The differential results observed in subgroup analyses raise questions about the accurate identification of suitable populations for FMT. Further investigation is needed to better understand the reasons behind these inconsistent findings and to determine the true potential of FMT as a treatment for IBS.",Wang Y; Hu Y; Shi P,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,217,10.1186/s12876-024-03311-x,"Wang, Y., Hu, Y., & Shi, P.

40083695,What is the Impact of Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Solid Tumours: A Qualitative Systematic Review and Quantitative Meta-Analysis.,"Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has gained increasing recognition as a crucial mechanism in the progression of solid cancers, influencing tumour heterogeneity, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. However, despite its growing importance, EndMT remains insufficiently studied within the cancer research landscape. In this study, we conduct a systematic review, adhered to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines, of the existing literature on EndMT in solid tumours, examining its functional roles, key biomarkers, underlying mechanisms, experimental models, and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Our objective was to identify critical areas where further research is needed. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the variability in the expression of EndMT-related markers and their potential links to patient prognosis. To this aim, literature searches were conducted in major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, covering studies published up to June 2024. The risk of bias of selected articles was evaluated using the OHAT tool, for the in vitro experiments and the SYRCLE tool for studies using animal models. Out of an initial pool of 1,197 articles, 54 studies were selected for data extraction by two independent reviewers. Selected studies were identified according to specific inclusion/exclusion criteria applied through distinct stages like ""title and abstract screening"", ""full text article review"" and ""article bibliography screening"". Our analysis confirms that EndMT is a key contributor to tumour progression and metastasis, but several aspects remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the induction of EndMT in specific cancer types, its role in lymphatic endothelial cells, and its interactions with other stromal elements. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the biomarkers associated with EndMT, as well as variations in the endothelial cell types studied, the functional outcomes, and the molecular mechanisms involved. Our meta-analysis revealed significant variability in the expression of EndMT biomarkers, with notable correlations between changes in the expression of specific genes and patient outcomes, particularly in lung cancer. In conclusion, it is essential for future research to focus on identifying the specific cancer and stromal cell types implicated in EndMT and to standardize endothelial cell models and protocols used for inducing EndMT. Investigating EndMT alongside well-established processes, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and exploring its relationship with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may provide valuable insights into its role in tumour biology and its impact on therapy resistance.",Hernández-Camarero P; Toledo B; Diaz-Ruano AB; González-Titos A; García-Ortega MB; Perán M,2025,International journal of biological sciences,21,5,2155-2178,10.7150/ijbs.107045,"Hernández-Camarero, P., Toledo, B., Diaz-Ruano, A.

32999906,Gastrointestinal Microbiome - What We Need to Know in Clinical Practice.,"Human gut microbiota plays an important role in individual health. When the balance between host and gut microbiota is disrupted, changes in microbiota composition and function occur, which is referred as dysbiosis. Environmental factors as diet, proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotics can lead to a permanent dysbiotic disruption. Clarification of these imbalances was made possible by recent advances in genome sequencing methods that supported acknowledgment of the interplay between microbiome and intestinal and extraintestinal disorders. This review focuses on the microbiota impact in inflammatory bowel disease, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Furthermore, novel therapies are summarized. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a successful and established therapy in recurrent CDI, and its application in other dysbiosis-related diseases is attracting enormous interest. Pre- and probiotics target microbial rebalance and have positive effects mainly in NAFLD, ulcerative colitis, IBS, and CDI patients. Promising anticarcinogenic effects have also been demonstrated in animal models. The literature increasingly describes microbial changes in many dysbiotic disorders and shows what needs to be treated. However, probiotics and FMT application in clinical practice suffers from a shortage of randomized controlled trials with standardized therapy regimens to support their recommendation.",Ortigão R; Pimentel-Nunes P; Dinis-Ribeiro M; Libânio D,2020,GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology,27,5,336-351,10.1159/000505036,"Ortigão, R., Pimentel-Nunes, P., Dinis-Ribeiro, M., & Libânio, D.

The aim of this manuscript was to clarify the real clinical impact of LM on these disorders.
METHODS: A literature search for digestive and extra-digestive disorders related to LM was carried out using PubMed, Medline and Cochrane.
RESULTS: A transient lactase deficiency is present in celiac disease (CD) on a normal diet. The persistence of symptoms in CD on a gluten-free diet may be instead, in part, attributed to a primary LM. Similar circumstances are present in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), in which LM can be responsible for a part of persistent symptoms in IBD on clinical remission. LM and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are instead independent conditions. On the other hand, a lactose-restricted diet may be useful for some IBS patients. A reduced lactose intake can lead to low bone mass and limited risk of fragility fractures. Finally, the absorption of levothyroxine could be conditioned by LM.
CONCLUSIONS: LM can be responsible for persistent symptoms in CD and IBD. The association with IBS seems to be casual. Bone mass and levothyroxine absorption can be affected by LM.",Usai-Satta P; Lai M; Oppia F,2022,Nutrients,14,3,,10.3390/nu14030584,"Usai-Satta, P., Lai, M., & Oppia, F. (2022).

39537891,Chronic Abdominal Pain in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Remission: A Continuing Challenge for Clinicians.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is characterized by a relapsing and remitting pattern that negatively impacts quality of life (QoL). Current goals of treatment involve symptomatic, biochemical, and endoscopic remission in a treat-to-target approach. Despite effective treatment and remission of IBD, many patients report frequent and isolated abdominal pain. A wide range of etiologies exist, including surgery-related, infections, pelvic conditions, immune-related, and systemic illnesses. Disorders of the gut-brain interaction (DGBI), frequently characterized by abdominal pain, are increasingly recognized in IBD patients, including those with quiescent disease.

The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and a mixture of these, and similar symptoms can be seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and celiac disease depending on the age of the patient, indicating the importance of differential diagnosis. The importance of patient management is shown by making a symptom-based diagnosis and making cost-effective, that is, limited advanced examinations. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifactorial, and stress is one of the leading triggers of IBS symptoms. Therefore, terminology will change to gut-brain interaction disorders in the future, and the patient-physician relationship has a special place in the treatment of functional bowel disorder. Dietary recommendation and medical treatment in IBS should be determined according to the predominant symptom and symptom severity. In addition to diet, some lifestyle changes can also be helpful in reducing IBS symptoms. Antispasmodics and antidepressants are not fast-acting. These drugs should be used for at least 2-4 weeks to see the efficacy of treatment.

37944641,"Fecal microbiota transplantation: History, procedure and regulatory considerations.","Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a medical treatment which involves the transfer of feces from a healthy donor to a recipient to restore the balance of gut microbiota and improve clinical outcomes. FMT has gained recognition in recent years due to its effectiveness in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDI) and other gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, it has been studied as an intervention for some other conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This review covers regulatory considerations related to FMT, including the current state of FMT regulation and the need for further research to fully understand the safety and efficacy of this treatment. For transplantation of fecal microbiota, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies the treatment as an investigational new drug (IND), which typically requires physicians and scientists to submit an IND application. Ethical issues surrounding FMT, including the necessity of informed consent from donors and recipients and the potential transmission of infectious agents, are also discussed. Overall, FMT has the potential to offer significant therapeutic benefits, but it also raises regulatory and ethical considerations that require careful consideration.

VOSviewer 1.6.20, Citespace 6.2.R4, and Microsoft Excel 2021 were used for bibliometric analysis. A total of 124 articles were included in the analysis. Overall, publication patterns fluctuated. Globally, People's Republic of China, the USA, and Germany were the top three contributors of publications. Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, University of California, Mayo Clinic, and University of California, Los Angeles contributed the highest number of publications. The pathways and specific mechanisms by which ncRNAs regulate transcription and translation and thus regulate the pathophysiological processes of IBS are the main research hotspots in this field. We found that microRNA (miRNAs) are intricately involved in the regulation of key pathologies such as viscera sensitivity, intestinal permeability, intestinal mucosal barrier, immunoinflammatory response, and brain-gut axis in the IBS, and these topics have garnered significant attention in research community. Notably, microecological disorders are also associated with IBS pathogenesis, and ncRNA may play an important role in the interactions between host and intestinal flora. This is the first bibliometric study to comprehensively summarize the research hotspots and trends related to IBS and ncRNAs (especially miRNAs). Our findings will help understand the role of ncRNAs in IBS and provide guidance to future studies.",Chen H; Xu Z; Zhao H; Cao J; Wang R; He J; Nie R; Jia J; Yuan S; Li Y; Liu Z; Zhang X; Ha L; Xu X; Li T,2024,Clinical and experimental medicine,24,1,149,10.1007/s10238-024-01396-y,"Chen, H., Xu, Z., Zhao, H., Cao, J., Wang, R., He, J., Nie, R., Jia, J., Yuan, S., Li, Y., Liu, Z., Zhang, X., Ha, L., Xu, X., & Li, T.

36036990,Safety of Intraoperative Blood Salvage During Liver Transplantation in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) on time to tumor recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver transplantation were assessed to evaluate the safety of IBS.
BACKGROUND: IBS is highly effective to reduce the use of allogeneic blood transfusion. However, the safety of IBS during liver transplantation for patients with HCC is questioned due to fear of disseminating malignant cells.
METHODS: Comprehensive searches through June 2021 were performed in 8 databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Robins-I tool. Meta-analysis with the generic inverse variance method was performed to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for disease-free survival, HCC recurrence and overall survival.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included (n=1997, IBS n=1200, no-IBS n=797). Use of IBS during liver transplantation was not associated with impaired disease-free survival [HR=0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.66-1.24, P=0.53, IBS n=394, no-IBS n=329], not associated with increased HCC recurrence (HR=0.83, 95% CI=0.57-1.23, P=0.36, IBS n=537, no-IBS n=382) and not associated with impaired overall survival (HR=1.04, 95% CI=0.79-1.37, P=0.76, IBS n=495, no-IBS n=356).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on available observational data, use of IBS during liver transplantation in patients with HCC does not result in impaired disease-free survival, increased HCC recurrence or impaired overall survival. Therefore, use of IBS during liver transplantation for HCC patients is a safe procedure.",Aijtink VJ; Rutten VC; Meijer BEM; de Jong R; Isaac JL; Polak WG; Perera MTPR; Sneiders D; Hartog H,2022,Annals of surgery,276,2,239-245,10.1097/SLA.0000000000005476,"Aijtink, V.

31284829,Psychological factors related to time to help-seeking for cancer symptoms: a meta-analysis across cancer sites.,"The time patients wait before seeking help for cancer symptoms is among the most important factors contributing to diagnostic delays in cancer. We reviewed the association between time to help-seeking and three psychological factors: symptom knowledge, symptom interpretation, and beliefs about cancer. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, providing data from 22 countries concerning seven cancer sites. Better symptom knowledge was related to lower odds of a long help-seeking interval in both studies with healthy populations (OR = .73, 95% CI [.63, .84], k = 19) and patients (OR = .40, 95% CI [.23, .69], k = 12), and so was interpreting experienced symptoms as cancer-related (OR = .52, 95% CI [.36, .75], k = 13 studies with patients). More positive beliefs about cancer (i.e., that cancer is treatable) were associated with lower odds of a long help-seeking interval in both studies with healthy populations (OR = .70, 95% CI [.52, .92], k = 11) and with patients (OR = .51, 95% CI [.32, .82], k = 7). Symptom knowledge, interpretation, and beliefs about cancer are likely to be universal predictors of help-seeking and should be incorporated into theoretical models of patient help-seeking and interventions aiming to reduce delays.",Petrova D; Okan Y; Salamanca-Fernández E; Domínguez-López S; Sánchez MJ; Rodríguez-Barranco M,2020,Health psychology review,14,2,245-268,10.1080/17437199.2019.1641425,"Petrova, D., Okan, Y., Salamanca-Fernández, E., Domínguez-López, S., Sánchez, M.

We summarized comparative efficacy of these in a recent network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).3 Tegaserod, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptor agonist, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for IBS-C, was withdrawn in 2007 after a small excess number of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular ischemic events in patients taking the drug.4 However, since our network meta-analysis, it has been reintroduced in the United States. It is therefore important to understand its efficacy relative to other available licensed therapies for IBS-C.",Black CJ; Burr NE; Ford AC,2020,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,18,5,1238-1239.e1,10.1016/j.cgh.2019.07.007,"Black, C.

35662700,An Overview of Systematic Reviews of Herbal Medicine for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder with abdominal pain and bowel habits changes. Herbal medicines (HMs) are frequently used in the treatment of IBS. Therefore, several systematic reviews (SRs) have been conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of HM in IBS patients. This study aimed to investigate the methodology and quality of evidence of SRs, and to describe the current state of research and evidence for the treatment of IBS with HM. Methods: SRs published up to January 2022 were searched using six electronic databases. SRs and/or meta-analyses on the use of HMs for IBS were included. The effects of placebo, conventional medicine (CM), and probiotics were compared with those of HMs. Two investigators independently extracted the data and assessed methodological quality using the Measure Tool to Assessment System Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for each main finding. Results: Eighteen SRs were included in this overview. Among them, eight SRs reported only specific subtypes of IBS: six SRs reported patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, and two SRs reported patients with constipation-predominant IBS. In terms of total efficacy, HM was more effective than placebo, CM, or probiotics. HM showed a more significant effect than CM in relieving independent IBS symptom score (abdominal pain score, diarrhea score, abdominal distension score, stool frequency score, etc.) and recurrence rate. The rate of adverse events was significantly lower with HM compared to CM, and no serious adverse events were reported with HM treatment. According to AMSTAR 2, the methodological quality of the included SRs was extremely low. Furthermore, the quality of evidence for total efficacy was considered low or very low according to the GRADE tool. Conclusion: HM can be considered as an effective and safe treatment for IBS. However, the methodological quality of the included SRs and the quality of evidence was generally low. Therefore, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed in the future so that a high-quality SR can be used to better assess the safety and efficacy of HM in the treatment of IBS.

39011760,Endoscopic Balloon Dilatation of Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis Strictures in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the treatment of choice for medically refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assess outcomes and safety of endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) for IPAA strictures.
METHODS: A systematic search of numerous databases was performed through June 2023 to identify studies reporting on the outcomes of EBD in pouch-related strictures. Outcomes included technical success, clinical success at index dilation and in pouch retention, recurrence of symptoms post-EBD, and adverse events of EBD. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, and results were expressed in terms of pooled rates along with relevant 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q statistical test with I2 statistics.
RESULTS: Seven studies with 504 patients were included. The pooled rate of technical success and clinical success of index dilatation was 98.9% (95% CI, 94.8-99.8%; I20%) and 30.2% (95% CI, 7.1-71%; I20%), respectively. The pooled rate of clinical success in pouch retention without the need for additional surgery was 81.4% (95% CI, 69.6-89.3%; I272%). The pooled failure rate of EBD was 18.6% (95% CI, 10.7-30.4%, I272%). The pooled rate of recurrence of symptoms after index dilatation was 58.9% (95% CI, 33.3-80.5%; I213%). The pooled rate of serious adverse events was 1.8% (95% CI, 1-3.5%, I20%). No deaths related to EBD were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilatation is safe and highly effective for management of IPAA strictures. Additional studies are needed to compare its efficacy with surgical interventions.",Dahiya DS; Jena A; Bapaye J; Mohan BP; Kassab LL; Facciorusso A; Chandan S; Kochhar GS,2025,Inflammatory bowel diseases,31,4,944-951,10.1093/ibd/izae128,"Dahiya, D.

37031468,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials using ROME IV criteria.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which affects a great number of patients globally. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have evaluated different therapies for IBS. Some of them have shown that probiotics play a significant role in the management of IBS-patients. Nevertheless, results are controversial, and the efficacy of the administration of probiotics remains to be confirmed, especially in regard to which type of probiotic-strains are beneficial.
AIM: The aim of the present meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of the administration of probiotics to IBS-patients with a diagnosis based on Rome IV criteria, which is performed for the first time.
METHODS: Electronic databases (Pubmed, Scopus and Cochrane) were searched until 26.01.2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the administration of probiotics in adult IBS-patients, who were categorized according to the Rome IV criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (ROB) 2.0. Weighted and standardized mean difference with the 95% confidence intervals were used for the synthesis of the results. Primary outcomes were the decrease of IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and decrease of abdominal pain. The secondary outcomes were the improvement in quality of life (QoL) and the decrease of bloating. Lastly, the adverse effects of probiotics were evaluated. The protocol of the study has been registered at protocols.io (DOI dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn218yg5d/v1).
RESULTS: Six double-blind (N = 970) placebo-control RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria and overall, nine different strains of probiotics were examined. No significant reduction in IBS-SSS (WMD -43.2, 95% CI -87.5 to 1.0, I2 = 82.9%) was demonstrated, whereas a significant decrease regarding abdominal pain (SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.35, I2 = 92,2) was shown. Furthermore, no correlation between improvement of QoL and the use of probiotics (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.00, I2 = 93,9%) was shown. However, probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in bloating (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.09, I2 = 36,0%). A qualitative synthesis was conducted about adverse events and showed that the use of probiotics' is safe without severe adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of probiotics to IBS-patients demonstrated a positive effect on pain and bloating, but due to significant heterogeneity and confounding factors, that were not examined in the included studies, a definitive statement cannot be made. Moreover, probiotics did not lead to an improvement in other parameters. There is a need for larger RCTs in IBS-patients diagnosed according to Rome IV (not III) criteria and especially it is essential to be conducted RCTs which examine the administration of specific strains and have similar methodological characteristics.",Konstantis G; Efstathiou S; Pourzitaki C; Kitsikidou E; Germanidis G; Chourdakis M,2023,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",42,5,800-809,10.1016/j.clnu.2023.03.019,"Konstantis, G., Efstathiou, S., Pourzitaki, C., Kitsikidou, E., Germanidis, G., & Chourdakis, M.

37695549,Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Like Symptoms in Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Practical Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment of Organic Causes.,"BACKGROUND: Despite achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are common in quiescent IBD. While irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is commonly diagnosed in IBD, IBS-like symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can also be attributed to a wide range of overlapping gastrointestinal (GI) etiologies and systemic disorders with GI manifestations that often do not respond to conventional IBS therapies. Delay in diagnosis of these conditions can lead to ongoing patient suffering, reduced quality of life, repetition of invasive testing, increased healthcare utilization, and potentially unnecessary empirical escalation of IBD-related treatments.
AIMS: This review provides a practical approach for the evaluation and diagnosis of IBS mimickers in IBD. We summarize the definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of the potential etiologies causing unexplained GI symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Overlapping conditions can co-exist with IBD and explain IBS-like symptoms. The diagnostic work-up in this population should be individualized and tailored to the predominant symptom pattern, associated clinical signs and symptoms and predisposing conditions that can be obtained from a detailed history and physical examination.",Lim J; Rezaie A,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,11,4081-4097,10.1007/s10620-023-08095-w,"Lim, J., & Rezaie, A.

32034916,Meta-analysis of Virtual-based Chromoendoscopy Compared With Dye-spraying Chromoendoscopy Standard and High-definition White Light Endoscopy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Increased Risk of Colon Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer. We sought to assess the comparative efficacy of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE) vs high definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE) or dye-spraying chromoendoscopy (DCE) through a meta-analysis and rating the quality of evidence.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed through February 15, 2019. Primary outcomes were number of patients in whom dysplasia was identified and number of dysplastic lesions identified in these patients. We included only randomized control trials (RCTs) and performed meta-analysis using RevMan5.3.
RESULTS: Of the 3205 studies identified, 11 RCTs were included, with a total of 1328 patients. Per patient analysis, VCE was not statistically different compared with DCE (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.55-1.08) or HDWLE (RR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.45-1.15). However, per dysplasia analysis, VCE was not statistically different compared with DCE (RR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.47-1.11) and inferior compared with HDWLE (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.88). The quality of evidence was moderate in the HDWLE and low to moderate in the DCE studies.
CONCLUSION: Based on this meta-analysis, VCE was as good as HDWLE and DCE in identifying dysplasia per patient analysis. However, per dysplasia analysis, VCE was inferior compared with HDWLE and no different from DCE. Further studies need to examine the efficacy of each individual VCE technique.",El-Dallal M; Chen Y; Lin Q; Rakowsky S; Sattler L; Foromera J; Grossberg L; Cheifetz AS; Feuerstein JD,2020,Inflammatory bowel diseases,26,9,1319-1329,10.1093/ibd/izaa011,"El-Dallal, M., Chen, Y., Lin, Q., Rakowsky, S., Sattler, L., Foromera, J., Grossberg, L., Cheifetz, A.

39669195,Herbal placebo response in clinical trials on irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To systematically evaluate the herbal placebo response in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicine on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for RCTs with herbal placebo groups for IBS in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Wan Fang database and Sinomed database from 31 January 1994 to November 2023, and the quality of the literature was evaluated by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment criteria. The primary outcome indicators were response rate, abdominal pain and stool improvement rate, which were analyzed by single-group rate meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes were analyzed in subgroups based on diagnostic criteria, duration of treatment, subtype, research locations, placebo form, and presence of herbal ingredients to look for factors affecting respond rate.
RESULTS: The study included 24 papers, involving a total of 2,596 patients. Of these, 1151 IBS patients were treated with the herbal placebo. The placebo response rate in IBS patients in the herbal placebo group was 37% (P < 0.01,I2 = 75%). A total of 287 patients in five studies were given the herbal placebo, and the improvement rate of abdominal pain was 29% (P = 0.83, I2 = 0%). Four studies enrolled a total of 212 patients with IBS who received herbal placebo, and the stool improvement rate was 46% (P = 0.02 < 0.05, I2 = 71%). The research locations and treatment duration were sources of heterogeneity (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is a significant herbal placebo response in patients with IBS. Different research locations and treatment durations are major sources of heterogeneity that may affect IBS patient response rates. The addition of a low dose of herbal ingredients when simulating an herbal placebo does not exaggerate the therapeutic effect of the placebo. There is a lack of uniformity and standardization in the preparation and evaluation of herbal placebos.",Huang K; Lv M; Zheng T; Wang F; Tang X; Lv L,2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,15,,1475366,10.3389/fphar.2024.1475366,"Huang, K., Lv, M., Zheng, T., Wang, F., Tang, X., & Lv, L.

39200318,"Oral Health and ""Modern"" Digestive Diseases: Pathophysiologic and Etiologic Factors.","In the contemporary era of medicine, exploring the complexity of the human body and its intricate interactions has become a central concern for health researchers. The main purpose of this article is to summarize the current understanding of relevant pathophysiological factors such as chronic inflammation, dysbiosis (microbial imbalance), and metabolic disorders, as well as etiological factors including dietary habits, lifestyle choices, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and genetic predispositions, as well as to emphasize potential avenues for upcoming studies and their medical significance. Additionally, this article aims to assess the potential impact of integrated treatment approaches on patient outcomes, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, dentists, and other healthcare professionals to develop comprehensive care plans that address both oral and digestive health issues simultaneously. Among the branches with a significant impact on general well-being are oral cavity health and digestive diseases, which have been the subject of intensive research in recent decades. In this context, analysis of the current state of knowledge on oral cavity disorders in relation to ""modern"" digestive diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) becomes essential for a deeper understanding of the interconnections between oral and digestive health. The temporal overlap or succession, whether preceding or following, of oral manifestations and digestive disorders should be taken seriously by both gastroenterologists and dentists to facilitate early diagnosis and explain to patients the correlation between these two body systems.

36412458,Application and development of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases: A review.,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores a balanced intestinal flora, which helps to cure recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (RCDI). FMT has also been used to treat other gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and chronic constipation, as well as a variety of non-GI disorders. The purpose of this review is to discuss gut microbiota and FMT treatment of GI and non-GI diseases. An imbalanced gut microbiota is known to predispose one to Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), IBD, and IBS. However, the complex role of the gut microbiota in maintaining health is a newer concept that is being increasingly studied. The microbiome plays a major role in cellular immunity and metabolism and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-GI autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, and even some neuropsychiatric disorders. Many recent studies have reported that viral gastroenteritis can affect intestinal epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been identified in the stool of infected patients. FMT is a highly effective cure for RCDI, but a better understanding of the gut microbiota in maintaining health and controlled studies of FMT in a variety of conditions are needed before FMT can be accepted and used clinically.",Mahmoudi H; Hossainpour H,2023,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,29,1,3-11,10.4103/sjg.sjg_131_22,"Mahmoudi, H., & Hossainpour, H.

37569265,Prognostic and Clinicopathological Significance of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Expression in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the current evidence in relation to the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published before November 2022. We evaluated the quality of primary-level studies using the QUIPS tool, conducted meta-analyses, examined inter-study heterogeneity via subgroup analyses and meta-regressions, and performed small-study effects analyses. Fifty primary-level studies (4631 patients) met the inclusion criteria. EGFR overexpression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.38, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.06-1.79, p = 0.02), N+ status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.01-1.86, p = 0.04), and moderately-poorly differentiated OSCC (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.05-1.94, p = 0.02). In addition, better results were obtained by the application of a cutoff point ≥10% tumor cells with EGFR overexpression (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis supports that the immunohistochemical assessment of EGFR overexpression may be useful as a prognostic biomarker for OSCC.",Cívico-Ortega JL; González-Ruiz I; Ramos-García P; Cruz-Granados D; Samayoa-Descamps V; González-Moles MÁ,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,15,,10.3390/ijms241511888,"Cívico-Ortega, J.

35728042,Effects of a low FODMAP diet on the colonic microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet is increasingly used to manage symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although this approach may alter the colonic microbiome, the nature of these changes has not been comprehensively synthesized.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the impact of a low FODMAP diet on the composition and function of the microbiome in patients with IBS.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of a low FODMAP diet on the colonic microbiome in patients with IBS in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science from inception to April 2022. Outcomes included diversity of the microbiome, specific bacterial abundances, fecal SCFA concentration, and fecal pH. For fecal SCFA concentrations and pH, meta-analyses were performed via a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Nine trials involving 403 patients were included. There were no clear effects of the low FODMAP diet on diversity of the microbiome. A low FODMAP diet consistently led to lower abundance of Bifidobacteria, but there were no clear effects on diversity of the microbiome or abundances of other specific taxa. There were no differences in total fecal SCFA concentration between the low FODMAP diet and control diets (standardized mean difference: -0.25; 95% CI: -0.63, 0.13; P = 0.20), nor were there differences for fecal concentrations of specific SCFAs or fecal pH.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS, the effects of a low FODMAP diet on the colonic microbiome appear to be specific to Bifidobacteria with no consistent impacts on other microbiome metrics, including diversity, fecal SCFA concentrations, and fecal pH. Further, adequately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings.This review was registered at https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ as CRD42020192243.",So D; Loughman A; Staudacher HM,2022,The American journal of clinical nutrition,116,4,943-952,10.1093/ajcn/nqac176,"So, D., Loughman, A., & Staudacher, H.

32387213,The efficacy and safety of probiotics for patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on seventeen randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: & Objectives: Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is functional bowel disorders that may involve disturbance of the gastrointestinal microbiota. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with IBS-C.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases up to 1 May 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with IBS-C that compared probiotics to placebo or no therapy were eligible for the analysis. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to calculate the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of remaining symptoms after therapy. Continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference (MD) with the 95% CI. Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. The analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.2.
RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs involving 1469 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, probiotics significantly increased stool frequency by 1.29 bowel movements (BM)/wk (95% CI: 0.69 to 1.89 BM/wk; P < 0.0001), and improved stool consistency (SMD: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.82; P = 0.0001). Compared with placebo, patients using probiotics experienced a shorter gut transit time by 12.36 h (95% CI: -20.74 to -3.98 h; P = 0.004). No serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally, probiotics may be safe and may improve whole gut transit time, stool frequency, and stool consistency. However, adequately powered RCTs are required to better determine the species or strains, doses, and duration of use of probiotics that are most efficacious. Further research and evidence is required before probiotics is adopted as one of treatments of IBS-C.",Wen Y; Li J; Long Q; Yue CC; He B; Tang XG,2020,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",79,,111-119,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.063,"Wen, Y., Li, J., Long, Q., Yue, C.

40126935,"The Relationship Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 49,662 Individuals.","BACKGROUND: Studies have shown mixed results regarding the association between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and metabolic syndrome (MS); This study aimed to assess the susceptibility of IBS patients to MS and its individual components.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science were searched on 1/1/2023. Eligible studies were screened, and data on study characteristics, IBS diagnostic criteria, and metabolic syndrome components were extracted. Data were analysed in RevMan 5.4, with results reported as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: IBS was associated with an increased risk of MS (RR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.50-2.79, p < 0.00001), with a higher risk among IBS-D patients (RR = 3.09, 95% CI = 2.41-3.97, p < 0.00001). IBS patients showed increased HOMA-IR (MD = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.15-0.26, p < 0.00001), higher obesity risk (RR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.10-1.93, p = 0.009), elevated BMI (MD = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.98-2.03, p-value < 0.00001), waist circumference (MD = 5.01, 95% CI = 1.29-8.72, p = 0.008), and an association with systolic hypertension (MD = -0.50, 95% CI = -0.60 to -0.40, p-value < 0.00001). IBS was also linked to higher LDL (MD = 5.98, 95% CI = 0.91-11.05, p = 0.02), total cholesterol (MD = 12.21, 95% CI = 6.23-18.18, p < 0.0001), and triglycerides (MD = 11.93, 95% CI = 11.55-12.31, p < 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates a potential association between IBS and metabolic syndrome, including its components such as obesity, hypertension, and lipid profile abnormalities.

37436005,Safety and efficacy of personalized versus standard initial dosing of thiopurines: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"BACKGROUND: Pretherapy assessment of specific genetic polymorphism (TPMT, NUDT15, FTO, RUNX1, etc) or enzyme levels (for TPMT) may help personalize the dose of thiopurines and avoid adverse effects.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing personalized versus standard strategy for initial thiopurine dosing was performed. The electronic databases were searched on 27 September 2022. The outcomes were overall adverse effects, myelotoxicity, drug interruptions, and therapeutic efficacy with either strategy. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE methodology.
RESULTS: We included six randomized trials, done dominantly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The personalized strategies were genotype testing in 4 trials (TPMT in three trials, NUDT15 in two) and enzyme levels for TPMT in two trials. The pooled risk of myelotoxicity in personalized dosing was lower [RR = 0.72 (95%CI, 0.55-0.94, I2 = 0%)]. The pooled risk of pancreatitis (RR = 1.10I, 0.78-1.56, I2 = 0%), hepatotoxicity (RR = 1.13, 0.69-1.88, I2 = 45), and GI intolerance (RR = 1.01, 0.92-1.10, I2 = 0) were similar in two groups. The pooled risk of drug interruption in individualized dosing was similar to the standard dosing group (RR = 0.97, I2 = 68%).

37150763,Is the microbiome the cause of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease? Lessons to consider from odontology.,"BACKGROUND: A substantial amount of research is pointing to the disrupted microbiome and dysfunctional host-microbiome interaction as potential causes of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The true cause of the diseases is still not fully elucidated, and the various treatments used are not truly effective in the long run, especially for IBD, since a true cure is not known to exist. Treatment failure and surgery are common for IBD, many times leading to a perceived lower quality of life, not to mention the enormous cost for society for treatment up until that point and after. Although it is clear that the microbiome has a major role in the disease, it seems the majority of the research and treatments are still focused on treating and understanding the inflammation and not the primary cause of the inflammation in the first place. This was also the case for many decades in the search for the cause of periodontitis (PD) and gingivitis (GV), a destructive and non-destructive inflammatory disorder, respectively, the first resulting in loss of tissue supporting the teeth. There was much uncertainty and confusion until it was fully established that the microbiome was the cause. PD treatments primarily nowadays reflect the cause, i.e. the removal of microbes. There is no doubt, however, that the inflammatory pathways are important in both diseases and the purpose of this text is not to dispute this in respect to gastrointestinal disorders too. However, a different view on inflammation and associated disorders is explored to explain the nature of extraintestinal manifestations.
PURPOSE: The aim of this report is not to systematically fully review the literature to try to strengthen causality, as there are many reviews that explore the microbial aspects of IBS and IBD. Instead, the objective is to above all reflect on what has been learned in the field of odontology/stomatology and discuss relevant gastrointestinal research in order to propose tentative hypotheses and questions regarding IBS and IBD aetiology. Perhaps it could help soften the confusion regarding the microbial aetiology and dysbiosis concept, while guiding future research and treatments, primarily regarding microbial transplants, antibiotics, and diet.",Andersson OP,2023,International journal of colorectal disease,38,1,117,10.1007/s00384-023-04406-9,"Andersson, O.

Efficacy was assessed by meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the manufacturer's information system for clinical studies investigating the safety and efficacy of Menthacarin. Efficacy analyses included change from baseline of epigastric pain and general improvement of the patients' condition.
RESULTS: Five randomized trials involving 580 patients were found, demonstrating significant effects of Menthacarin on symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) compared to placebo or similar effects compared to a reference drug. Seven other studies reported favorable results on therapeutic application in FD patients with concomitant Helicobacter pylori infection, in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and on tolerability in FD patients from 12 years of age. Three trials in FD with 249 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in pain intensity (standardized mean difference: 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-1.21) and in item 2 of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (risk ratio: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.81-3.87) for Menthacarin.

40431349,Moderate Wine Consumption and Gastrointestinal Diseases.,"By conducting a narrative review of the scientific literature, the authors of this study sought to verify whether there were sufficient data to answer the following question: ""Can wine positively or negatively influence the incidence and severity of disorders associated with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases?"". In this review, most of the studies considered tested different alcoholic beverages (other than wine), not always reporting in the conclusions the possible difference in the extent of symptoms. Although alcohol certainly plays a central role in influencing the oesophageal and gastric environment, no studies evaluating the role of alcohol as such were included, since the aim of the review was to understand whether wine can be moderately consumed by patients with gastrointestinal diseases. The analysis of studies selected from the main reference databases indicates that even moderate wine consumption can be a source of discomfort in subjects with the GI diseases included in this review (gastritis and gastroesophageal disease, gastrointestinal motility, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and microscopic colitis). This does not mean that a certain percentage of patients cannot tolerate moderate amounts of alcoholic beverages; however, discussion with the family doctor or specialist is essential to identify the correct diet in which to include or exclude the consumption of wine. One of the limitations of this review is the low number of studies available, at least for some of the pathologies considered. It is important to emphasise, however, that some selected epidemiological studies, which include many subjects (even over 100,000), can provide useful information from a scientific point of view.",Restani P; Di Lorenzo C; Antoce AO; Araujo M; Bani C; Mercogliano F; Ruf JC; Kosti RI; Teissedre PL,2025,Nutrients,17,10,,10.3390/nu17101608,"Restani, P., Di Lorenzo, C., Antoce, A.

In this review, we aimed to identify the reported prevalence of IBS or functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) in children with IBD in remission. A search of three databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed) was performed to identify studies reporting the prevalence of IBS or FAPDs in pediatric patients with IBD in remission. A total of 60 studies were identified, with four eligible studies remaining following abstract screening. In children with IBD in remission, the overall prevalence of IBS ranged between 3.9 and 16.1%, and the overall prevalence of FAPDs ranged between 9.6 and 29.5%. The prevalence of FAPDs in patients in biomarker-based remission was generally higher than those in clinical remission (range 16-22.5% vs 9.6-16.7%, respectively). There is a paucity of literature reporting on the prevalence of IBS or FAPDs in children with IBD in remission.

39551466,A review investigating delays in Crohn's disease diagnosis.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract where early diagnosis and timely, appropriate management are essential to prevent severe complications and reduce the need for surgery. This review sought to investigate factors contributing to diagnostic delays in CD, which typically ranged from 5 to 16 months. Delays were often due to nonspecific symptoms that could be mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and were influenced by various factors including age, education level, smoking, NSAID use, and disease characteristics like isolated ileal involvement. Healthcare system disparities also played a significant role, with delays varying by access to care. The review highlighted that delayed diagnosis was linked to worse disease outcomes, such as increased severity and complications, and underscored the importance of early intervention combined with timely management. Strategies to mitigate delays included implementing red flag tools, using inflammatory biomarkers like fecal calprotectin, and enhancing public and healthcare provider awareness. Addressing these factors and improving referral pathways and healthcare system efficiencies were crucial for enhancing early diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Souaid C; Fares E; Primard P; Macaigne G; El Hajj W; Nahon S,2025,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,49,1,102500,10.1016/j.clinre.2024.102500,"Souaid, C., Fares, E., Primard, P., Macaigne, G., El Hajj, W., & Nahon, S.

34236740,Current status of fecal microbiota transplantation for irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal functional disorder. Although IBS is a benign condition, it reduces the quality of life considerably. While there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems to be promising.
PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to analysis possible factors affecting the success or failure of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of FMT for IBS and highlighting the gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled and of sketching a possible model for successful FMT in IBS patients.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of literature published in English from January 2015 to December 2020 using the keywords: fecal microbiota transplantation, randomized trials, and IBS.
KEY RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of FMT for IBS were found in the literature. Four of the seven RCTs found various positive effects, while the other three did not find any effect.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: The efficacy of FMT for IBS appears to be donor-dependent. The effective (super) donor would need to have a favorable microbiota signature, and 11 clinical criteria that are known to be associated with a favorable microbiota have been suggested for selecting FMT donors for IBS. Comparing the microbiota of the effective donors with those of healthy subjects would reveal the favorable microbiota signature required for a super-donor. However, the studies reviewed were not designed to compare efficacy of different donor types. The dose of the fecal transplant is also an important factor influencing the outcome of FMT for IBS. However, further studies designed to test the effect of fecal transplant dose are needed to answer this question. Administering the fecal transplant to either the small or large intestine seems to be effective, but the optimal route of administration remains to be determined. Moreover, whether single or repeated FMT is more effective is also still unclear. A 1-year follow-up of IBS patients who received FMT showed that adverse events of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation were both mild and self-limiting.",El-Salhy M; Hausken T; Hatlebakk JG,2021,Neurogastroenterology and motility,33,11,e14157,10.1111/nmo.14157,"El-Salhy, M., Hausken, T., & Hatlebakk, J.

33614028,The role of faecal microbiota transplantation: looking beyond Clostridioides difficile infection.,"Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of screened and minimally processed faecal material from a 'healthy' donor to 'diseased' recipient. It has an established role, and is recommended as a therapeutic strategy, in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Recognition that gut dysbiosis is associated with, and may contribute to, numerous disease states has led to interest in exploiting FMT to 'correct' this microbial imbalance. Conditions for which it is proposed to be beneficial include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, systemic inflammatory states like sepsis, and even coronavirus disease 2019. To understand what role, if any, FMT may play in the management of these conditions, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the therapy. Regardless, there are several barriers to its more widespread adoption, which include incompletely understood mechanism of action (especially outside of CDI), inability to standardise treatment, disagreement on its active ingredients and how it should be regulated, and lack of long-term outcome and safety data. Whilst the transfer of faecal material from one individual to another to treat ailments or improve health has a history dating back thousands of years, there are fewer than 10 randomised controlled trials supporting its use. Moving forward, it will be imperative to gather as much data from FMT donors and recipients over as long a timeframe as possible, and for trials to be conducted with rigorous methodology, including appropriate control groups, in order to best understand the utility of FMT for indications beyond CDI. This review discusses the history of FMT, its appreciable mechanisms of action with reference to CDI, indications for FMT with an emerging evidence base above and beyond CDI, and future perspectives on the field.",D Goldenberg S; Merrick B,2021,Therapeutic advances in infectious disease,8,,2049936120981526,10.1177/2049936120981526,"D Goldenberg, S., & Merrick, B.

35091134,Significance of p53 overexpression in the prediction of the malignant transformation risk of oral potentially malignant disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the current evidence in relation to the predictive value of p53 overexpression as a biomarker of the malignant transformation risk in oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus for studies published before July-2021, not restricted by date or publication language, with longitudinal design and assessing p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the quality of primary-level studies using QUIPS tool. We carried out meta-analyses, examined inter-study heterogeneity through subgroup and meta-regression analyses, and performed sensitivity and small-study effects analyses to test the stability and reliability of results.
RESULTS: Twenty four studies (1,210 patients) met inclusion criteria. P53 overexpression was associated with a statistically significant about 2 fold risk (RR = 1.88, 95 %CI = 1.39-2.56, p < 0.001). Leukoplakia maintained this significant relationship after subgroup meta-analysis (p = 0.002). Regarding the immunohistochemical technique, better results were obtained by the subgroups using anti-p53 DO7 antibody (p = 0.001), at high concentration (dilution < 1: 100, p < 0.001), incubated for long periods (overnight, p = 0.02), and at low temperature (4 °C, p = 0.007). Furthermore, meta-regression analysis showed that the association between p53 overexpression and higher oral cancer risk was independent of the presence and/or severity of epithelial dysplasia (p > 0.05).

34684663,Vitamin D Supplementation and Mental Health in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with decreased quality of life and mental health problems. Among various approaches to supportive therapy that aims to improve mental health in affected individuals, vitamin D supplementation is considered to be an effective method which may also be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms during the course of IBDs and IBS. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in adults with inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, including IBDs and IBS. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included. The human studies eligible to be included in the review should have described any intervention involving vitamin D as a supplement in a group of adult patients suffering from IBDs and/or IBS and should have assessed any component of mental health, but studies presenting the effects of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After eliminating the duplicates, a total of 8514 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers. Further evaluation was carried out on the basis of title, abstract, and full text. Finally, 10 studies (four for IBDs and six for IBS) were selected for the current systematic review, and their quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The studies analyzed the influence of various doses of vitamin D on bowel diseases, compared the results of vitamin D supplementation with placebo, or administered specific doses of vitamin D to obtain the required level in the blood. Supplementation was performed for at least 6 weeks. The analyzed mental health outcomes mainly included disease-specific quality of life/quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The majority of studies (including high-quality ones) confirmed the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, which was proven by all research works evaluating anxiety and depression and by the majority of research works evaluating quality of life. Although the studies followed different dosage regimens and supplementation protocols, the positive influence of vitamin D on mental health was found to be consistent. The number of studies on patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and the availability of trials randomized against the placebo group was low in the current review, which is considered to be a limitation of the present study and could also reflect the final outcome of the analysis. The conducted systematic review established the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, but this result requires further investigation, particularly in relation to other mental health outcomes.",Głąbska D; Kołota A; Lachowicz K; Skolmowska D; Stachoń M; Guzek D,2021,Nutrients,13,10,,10.3390/nu13103662,"Głąbska, D., Kołota, A., Lachowicz, K., Skolmowska, D., Stachoń, M., & Guzek, D.

33361035,"Comparison of gut microbiota profile in celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review.","Gut microbiota is vital for human health. Shifts in the microbial diversity can affect bacterial function, and dysbiosis is associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The distinction between IBS and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is unclear, and it is conceivable that the gut microbiota profile of these patients may overlap. To our knowledge, no existing literature has evaluated the microbial characteristics in CD, IBS, and NCGS. Hence, this systematic review aims to compare the gut microbiota profile in these three diagnoses. A literature search was conducted in PubMed (Medline) until April 2019. Studies investigating bacterial diversity in the gut of patients with CD, IBS, and NCGS were eligible. Inclusion criteria were observational studies and randomized controlled trials reporting bacterial profile at baseline. Ninety-one articles were identified, of which 13 trials were eligible for inclusion. Overall, the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota of patients with CD and those with IBS shared the many similarities. The microbial richness was correspondingly reduced in these patient-groups compared with healthy controls, but this was not reported for NCGS. Our findings suggest that the bacterial profiles of patients with IBS and CD share certain disease-specific trends. Fewer similarities were observed between the bacterial profiles of patients with IBS and NCGS. Notably, the data are limited; thus, no solid conclusions can be made on the basis of these findings alone. The suggested trends can be a valuable basis for further research.",Transeth EL; Dale HF; Lied GA,2020,The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,31,11,735-745,10.5152/tjg.2020.19551,"Transeth, E.

39057399,Fucoidan as a Promising Drug for Pain Treatment: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Fucoidan is a polymer of L-fucose and L-fucose-4-sulphate naturally found in marine sources that inhibits p-selectin, preventing neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury. Fucoidan is employed in many studies as a tool to investigate the contribution of neutrophils to pain, showing analgesic effects. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the analgesic effects of pretreatment with fucoidan reported in the available preclinical studies. In addition, we summarized the articles which have studied the therapeutic effects of fucoidan in pathological pain at preclinical and clinical levels. The results of this systematic review reveal that pretreatment with fucoidan is a powerful tool which reduces neutrophil infiltration by 70-90% at early time points. This meta-analysis showed that preventative treatment with fucoidan produced a significant pain reduction. In addition, several preclinical studies have observed that fucoidan treatment reduces the pain that is associated with various pathologies. Finally, fucoidan has also been tested in several clinical trials, with some degree of analgesic efficacy, but they were mostly small pilot studies. Considering all the above information, it can be concluded that fucoidan is not only a preclinical tool for studying the role of neutrophils in pain but also a promising therapeutic strategy for pain treatment.",Huerta MÁ; Tejada MÁ; Nieto FR,2024,Marine drugs,22,7,,10.3390/md22070290,"Huerta, M.

35308554,Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis of Population-Based Observational Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence on the association between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether IBS leads to an increased risk for CRC using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched to identify all relevant literature published through July 30, 2021. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC after diagnosis of IBS were computed using random-and fixed-effects models and stratified by age, follow-up time, gender, and study design. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: We included six studies consisting of 1,085,024 participants. Overall, the risk of detecting CRC after the initial IBS diagnosis was significantly higher than non-IBS controls (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04-2.22, P = 0.032). The peak of elevated risk occurred within the first year of IBS diagnosis (RR = 6.84, 95% CI: 3.70-12.65, P < 0.001), and after 1 year, the risk of CRC was similar to that of the general population (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88-1.18, P = 0.813). Notably, we found that the RR of CRC was more significant in IBS patients younger than 50 years compared to those older than 50 years (RR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.17-3.53, P = 0.012 vs. 1.28, 95%CI: 0.94-1.75, P = 0.118, respectively). Gender and study design did not affect the results.
CONCLUSION: The risk of CRC within one year of the initial IBS diagnosis was increased approximately six-fold, whereas the long-term risk was not increased. However, current evidence does not support that IBS leads to an increased incidence of CRC, and the early excess risk is more likely attributable to misclassification resulting from overlapping symptoms rather than causation. Clinicians must remain vigilant for the CRC risk in patients younger than 50 years with IBS-like symptoms to avoid delaying necessary screening.",Wu X; Wang J; Ye Z; Wang J; Liao X; Liv M; Svn Z,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,819122,10.3389/fmed.2022.819122,"Wu, X., Wang, J., Ye, Z., Wang, J., Liao, X., Liv, M., & Svn, Z.

36097404,Anti-inflammatory effects of vagal nerve stimulation with a special attention to intestinal barrier dysfunction.,"The vagus nerve (VN), the longest nerve of the organism innervating the gastrointestinal tract, is a mixed nerve with anti-inflammatory properties through its afferents, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, and its efferents through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα) by splenic and gut macrophages. In addition, the VN is also able to modulate the permeability of the intestinal barrier although the VN does not innervate directly the intestinal epithelium. Targeting the VN through VN stimulation (VNS) has been developed in experimental model of intestinal inflammation and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and might be of interest to decrease intestinal permeability in gastrointestinal disorders with intestinal barrier defect such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease. In this issue of neurogastroenterology and motility, Mogilevski et al. report that a brief non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS in healthy volunteers consistently reduces the permeability of the small intestine induced by intravenous administration of the stress peptide corticotropin releasing hormone, known to increase intestinal permeability and to inhibit the VN. In this review, we outline the mechanistic underpinning the effect of stress, of the VN and VNS on intestinal permeability. In particular, the VN can act on intestinal permeability through enteric nerves, and/or cells such as enteric glial cells. We also review the existing evidence of the effects VNS on intestinal permeability in models such as burn intestinal injury and traumatic brain injury, which pave the way for future clinical trials in IBD, IBS, and celiac disease.",Bonaz B,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,10,e14456,10.1111/nmo.14456,"Bonaz, B.

39752392,Systematic Review: Integrated Models of Care for Managing Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary integrated models of care show promise for improving symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
AIMS: To describe and evaluate the characteristics of integrated models of care for IBS and identify how digital health is being used in these models of care.
METHODS: Four databases were searched to March 2024 for studies that included adults with IBS who participated in multidisciplinary integrated models of care that delivered non-pharmacological therapies. The template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to appraise study quality and extract model of care characteristics, which were mapped against the Project INTEGRATE framework to establish topics.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies (6 randomized controlled trials, 2 quasi-experimental, 8 cohort studies) reported 14 integrated models of care including 2165 patients of which 918 were IBS patients. Integrated models of care led to improved IBS symptoms (n = 11/13 models of care) and QoL (n = 6/9 models of care). Studies showed moderate compliance with the TIDieR checklist. Five topics were established: clinicians involved, therapies provided, location and mode of delivery, coordinating clinical partnerships, and sharing visions and values of integrated care. Most commonly, a gastroenterologist coordinated care with a psychologist, dietitian, and/or nurse in tertiary care. Psychological, dietary, and physical therapies were provided by n = 11, n = 8, and n = 3 integrated models of care, respectively. Six models of care provided joint consultations or group sessions. Four models of care used digital health such as telephone coaching or online modules.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated models of care for IBS exhibited diverse characteristics including the clinicians involved, the therapies provided and the mode of delivery of each therapy. There is a need to evaluate the use of digital health and the delivery of integrated models of care in primary care settings.",Warner MM; Soliman OM; Crichton M; Marshall S; Staudacher HM; Kelly JT,2025,Neurogastroenterology and motility,37,2,e14989,10.1111/nmo.14989,"Warner, M.

40013938,Advances in Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Gut Dysbiosis-Related Diseases.,"This article provides an overview of the advancements in the application of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in treating diseases related to intestinal dysbiosis. FMT involves the transfer of healthy donor fecal microbiota into the patient's body, aiming to restore the balance of intestinal microbiota and thereby treat a variety of intestinal diseases such as recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), constipation, short bowel syndrome (SBS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While FMT has shown high efficacy in the treatment of rCDI, further research is needed for its application in other chronic conditions. This article elaborates on the application of FMT in intestinal diseases and the mechanisms of intestinal dysbiosis, as well as discusses key factors influencing the effectiveness of FMT, including donor selection, recipient characteristics, treatment protocols, and methods for assessing microbiota. Additionally, it emphasizes the key to successful FMT.

BACKGROUND: There is limited composite data on the outcomes of ESD for RTDLs versus non-RTDLs.
STUDY: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported the clinical outcomes of ESD for RTDLs and non-RTDLs. Main outcomes were pooled estimated rates of en bloc/complete/curative resection, local recurrence, and incidence of bleeding, perforation, stricture, anal pain, and fever.
RESULTS: Six studies were enrolled, including 265 cases of RTDLs and 788 cases of non-RTDLs. The en bloc resection rate was comparable for RTDLs and non-RTDLs [odds ratio (OR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-1.95; P=0.90]. The complete resection rate was significantly lower for RTDLs (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.83; P=0.003), as well as the curative resection rate (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.87; P=0.010). The rates of stricture, postoperative anal pain and local recurrence were significantly higher for RTDLs than non-RTDLs (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.01-9.31; P=0.05) (OR, 42.10; 95% CI, 4.73-374.97; P=0.0008) (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.13-7.96; P=0.03), but the higher rates of postoperative bleeding and fever for RTDLs were not significantly (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.53-3.30; P=0.54) (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 0.55-9.07; P=0.26), as well as its lower perforation rate (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.27-2.63; P=0.78).

Among these, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea affect about half of the FD adults and more than half of FD children. GI symptoms could be the first manifestation of FD; however, being non-specific, they overlap with the clinical picture of other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This common overlap is the main reason why FD patients are often unrecognized and diagnosis is delayed for many years. The present narrative review is aimed to promote awareness of the GI manifestations of FD amongst general practitioners and specialists and highlight the latest findings of this rare condition including diagnostic tools and therapies.

40048890,Attention in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review of affected domains and brain-gut axis interactions.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder characterized by gut-brain interactions, leading to abdominal pain and altered stool patterns, which significantly affect patients' quality of life. Recent research suggests that attention may be impaired in individuals with IBS, potentially influencing symptom perception and emotional distress.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to examine the relationship between attention and IBS, focusing on the affected domains of attention and the interactions within the brain-gut axis.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across MEDLINE/PubMed, PsychINFO, and Scopus from January 1990 to December 2024. Studies included were those that assessed attention in adult IBS patients using valid measurement tools. A total of 24 studies were analyzed, incorporating neuroimaging and behavioral methods.
RESULTS: IBS individuals exhibit specific attentional impairments, including deficits in sustained attention, selective attentional biases toward gastrointestinal (GI)-related and symptom-specific stimuli, and heightened vigilance to threat and pain cues. Neurofunctional studies reveal altered brain activity in areas such as the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, indicating increased interoceptive awareness and cognitive load. Pre-attentive processing and sensory gating show exaggerated responses, while sustained attention and attentional control demand additional cognitive resources. These patterns reflect an interplay between heightened sensitivity to internal stimuli and cognitive processing challenges in IBS.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights specific attentional deficits and biases in IBS, suggesting they may contribute to symptom exacerbation and emotional distress. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions.",Akbari R; Salimi Y; Dehghani-Aarani F; Rezayat E,2025,Journal of psychosomatic research,191,,112067,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2025.112067,"Akbari, R., Salimi, Y., Dehghani-Aarani, F., & Rezayat, E.

36050591,Structure Composition and Intracellular Transport of Clathrin-Mediated Intestinal Transmembrane Tight Junction Protein.,"Tight junctions (TJs) are located in the apical region of the junctions between epithelial cells and are widely found in organs such as the brain, retina, intestinal epithelium, and endothelial system. As a mechanical barrier of the intestinal mucosa, TJs can not only maintain the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells but also maintain intestinal mucosal permeability by regulating the entry of ions and molecules into paracellular channels. Therefore, the formation disorder or integrity destruction of TJs can induce damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier, ultimately leading to the occurrence of various gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, a large number of studies have shown that TJs protein transport disorder from the endoplasmic reticulum to the apical membrane can lead to TJs formation disorder, in addition to disruption of TJs integrity caused by external pathological factors and reduction of TJs protein synthesis. In this review, we focus on the structural composition of TJs, the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles containing transmembrane TJs from the Golgi apparatus, and the transport process from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane via microtubules and finally fusion with the plasma membrane. At present, the mechanism of the intracellular transport of TJ proteins remains unclear.

Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated their efficacy, but it has rarely been compared with first-line antispasmodics to verify their effectiveness. Therefore, we compare acupuncture with antispasmodics in the treatment of IBS by using an adjusted indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis. Methods: Embase, OVID Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to 14 March 2022, with no language restrictions. RCTs comparing antispasmodics or acupuncture with placebo or one of the antispasmodics were enrolled. The primary outcome of interest was the improvement of abdominal pain. And the secondary outcomes of interest were the relief of global IBS symptoms and adverse events. The random-effects model was utilized to pool data. The effect size was measured by standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative ratio, and the effectiveness of acupuncture and different antispasmodics were ranked by P-scores. Results: Thirty-five RCTs (n = 5,190) were included. The analysis showed that cimetropium, drotaverine, acupuncture, and pinarverium were superior over placebo in relieving abdominal pain; cimetropium (SMD, -3.00 [95%CI, -4.47 to -1.53], P-score = 0.99) ranked the most effective. In pairwise comparisons, acupuncture had a greater improvement than most antispasmodics except cimetropium and drotaverine in relieving abdominal pain, although the between-group difference was statistically insignificant. In the analysis of continuous outcome in the relief of global IBS symptoms, the result showed that pinaverium was more effective (SMD, 1.72 [95%CI, 0.53 to 2.92], P-score = 0.90) than placebo. Trimebutine and acupuncture had greater improvements than placebo, but no significant difference was shown between groups. In pairwise comparisons, acupuncture was more effective than pinaverium (SMD, -1.11 [95%CI, -1.94 to -0.28]) in relieving global IBS symptoms. In the analysis of adverse events, acupuncture had a lower adverse event rate than most of the other antispasmodics. Conclusion: Cimetropium, drotaverine, and acupuncture were all better than placebo in improving abdominal pain.

38047738,The incidence and predisposing factors for irritable bowel syndrome following COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Several studies have analyzed the long-term GI symptoms and IBS following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence and predisposing factors for IBS following COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Primary outcomes were the pooled incidence rate of IBS following COVID-19 and the pooled relative risk (RR) for IBS in the COVID-19 group compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Secondary outcomes were the pooled RR and the standardized mean difference (SMD) for predisposing factors in the IBS group compared to the non-IBS group. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this study. The pooled incidence rate of IBS in COVID-19 patients was 12%. The pooled incidence rate of IBS-D, IBS-C and IBS-M was 5%, 2% and 1%. The pooled incidence rate of IBS in 6 and 12 months was 10% and 3%. The pooled RR for IBS in COVID-19 patients was 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-3.01] compared to non-COVID-19 patients. The pooled RR or SMD for mild, moderate, and severe disease activity, procalcitonin (PCT), depression or anxiety in IBS patients following COVID-19 was 0.94 (95% CI = 0.74-1.21), 1.19 (95% CI = 0.65-2.21), 1.30 (95% CI = 0.63-2.66), 6.73 (95% CI = 6.08-7.38) and 3.21 (95% CI = 1.79-5.75).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of IBS following COVID-19 was 12%. But it was not higher than the general population.

HO-1, a stress inducible enzyme, is considered as an anti-oxidative and cytoprotective agent. As many studies suggest, HO-1 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract where it is involved in the response to inflammatory processes, which may lead to several diseases such as pancreatitis, diabetes, fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. In this review, we highlight the pivotal role of HO-1 and its downstream effectors in the development of disorders and their beneficial effects on the maintenance of the gastrointestinal tract health.

36364953,Impact of Total Parenteral Nutrition on Gut Microbiota in Pediatric Population Suffering Intestinal Disorders.,"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-saving therapy providing nutritional support in patients with digestive tract complications, particularly in preterm neonates due to their gut immaturity during the first postnatal weeks. Despite this, PN can also result in several gastrointestinal complications that are the cause or consequence of gut mucosal atrophy and gut microbiota dysbiosis, which may further aggravate gastrointestinal disorders. Consequently, the use of PN presents many unique challenges, notably in terms of the potential role of the gut microbiota on the functional and clinical outcomes associated with the long-term use of PN. In this review, we synthesize the current evidence on the effects of PN on gut microbiome in infants and children suffering from diverse gastrointestinal diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), short bowel syndrome (SBS) and subsequent intestinal failure, liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Moreover, we discuss the potential use of pre-, pro- and/or synbiotics as promising therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of severe gastrointestinal disorders and mortality. The findings discussed here highlight the need for more well-designed studies, and harmonize the methods and its interpretation, which are critical to better understand the role of the gut microbiota in PN-related diseases and the development of efficient and personalized approaches based on pro- and/or prebiotics.",Cerdó T; García-Santos JA; Rodríguez-Pöhnlein A; García-Ricobaraza M; Nieto-Ruíz A; G Bermúdez M; Campoy C,2022,Nutrients,14,21,,10.3390/nu14214691,"Cerdó, T., García-Santos, J.

39110917,Nutritional Interventions in Adult Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"CONTEXT: There is still debate regarding the effect of nutritional interventions in improving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine the evidence certainty and validity of all existing meta-analyses of intervention trials on nutritional interventions in patients with IBS.
DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science were reviewed until June 2023.
DATA EXTRACTION: Meta-analyses assessing the impacts of nutritional interventions in adults with IBS were entered. Effect sizes of nutritional interventions were recalculated by applying a random-effects model. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was implemented to determine evidence certainty.
RESULTS: A total of 175 trials in 58 meta-analyses were entered describing the effects of 11 nutritional interventions on IBS-related outcomes. Nutritional interventions had beneficial effects on some IBS-related outcomes. For instance, soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and aloe vera improved IBS symptoms, and vitamin D3 and curcumin improved IBS symptom severity. Tongxieyaofang improved abdominal pain severity and stool frequency. Nevertheless, these outcomes have mainly shown small effects and low to very low evidence certainty. With regard to abdominal pain after probiotic supplementation (relative risk [RR]: 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.36, 6.92; GRADE = moderate) and IBS symptoms after a low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet (RR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.93; GRADE = moderate), there was evidence that probiotics and a low-FODMAP diet can confer clinical and favorable effects.
CONCLUSION: The current review does not support nutritional interventions for improving IBS symptoms. With regard to probiotics and a low-FODMAP diet, considering limitations like short-term study duration, there was an influential clinical impact.

36723172,Fungal feelings in the irritable bowel syndrome: the intestinal mycobiome and abdominal pain.,"Although the gut microbiota consists of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, most publications addressing the microbiota-gut-brain axis in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a sole focus on bacteria. This may relate to the relatively low presence of fungi and viruses as compared to bacteria. Yet, in the field of inflammatory bowel disease research, the publication of several papers addressing the role of the intestinal mycobiome now suggested that these low numbers do not necessarily translate to irrelevance. In this review, we discuss the available clinical and preclinical IBS mycobiome data, and speculate how these recent findings may relate to earlier observations in IBS. By surveying literature from the broader mycobiome research field, we identified questions open to future IBS-oriented investigations.",van Thiel I; de Jonge W; van den Wijngaard R,2023,Gut microbes,15,1,2168992,10.1080/19490976.2023.2168992,"van Thiel, I., de Jonge, W., & van den Wijngaard, R.

39571562,A Meta-Analysis of Proton Pump Inhibitor Exposure and the Risk of Adverse Outcomes in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) exposure and adverse outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: According to the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE), we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases for relevant cohort and case-control studies comparing the incidence of adverse outcomes between IBD patients exposed to PPIs and those not exposed, from the inception of the databases to April 2024. The primary adverse outcomes analyzed included hospitalization and surgery.
RESULTS: Five studies, encompassing nearly 100,000 subjects, were included in this meta-analysis. The findings indicated that IBD patients exposed to PPIs had a significantly higher incidence of adverse outcomes compared to those not exposed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.44, p = 0.004), although it was low-quality evidence. This increased risk was observed in both ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.04-1.83, p = 0.025) and Crohn's disease (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02-1.29, p = 0.025). Additionally, the incidence of surgery was higher in IBD patients with PPI exposure (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.02-1.68). However, the OR for hospitalization did not show a statistically significant difference (OR = 1.43, p = 0.244). Moreover, the use of glucocorticoids was more frequent among patients exposed to PPIs (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.06-1.28, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: PPI exposure may be associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in IBD patients, particularly a higher rate of surgery. Limited by various factors, the evidence is considered low quality.",Zhang Q; Lou D; Zhang Y; Xu A; Fang Y; Zhou X,2025,"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",43,1,28-35,10.1159/000542729,"Zhang, Q., Lou, D., Zhang, Y., Xu, A., Fang, Y., & Zhou, X.

40735813,Impacts of the Long-Term Low-FODMAP Diet in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) is the primary intervention for managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, due to its restrictive nature, concerns have been raised about its safety and efficacy with long-term use. This study aims to investigate the outcomes of long-term LFD (LLFD) in patients with IBS.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to November 2024. LLFD was defined as LFD for at least 6 months. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. The protocol of the study was registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42024609338).
RESULTS: Of the total 2724 screened records, five studies finally met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study (324 patients). LLFD was able to reduce overall gastrointestinal symptoms (SMD -1.97, 95% CI -3.63 to -0.30), anxiety (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.15) and depression (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.53, to -0.03). Additionally, LLFD improved quality of life (mean difference 0.53, 95% CI 0.24-0.83). However, it was not able to improve the quality of sleep (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term use of LFD appears effective in improving gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological well-being, and quality of life in patients with IBS. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore additional long-term outcomes.",Pouladi A; Arabpour E; Bahrami O; Sadeghi A; Mozafari Komesh Tape P; Abdehagh M; Zali MR,2025,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,38,4,e70105,10.1111/jhn.70105,"Pouladi, A., Arabpour, E., Bahrami, O., Sadeghi, A., Mozafari Komesh Tape, P., Abdehagh, M., & Zali, M.

34425274,Placebo Response Rates in Trials of Licensed Drugs for Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Constipation or Diarrhea: Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are several licensed drugs for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but placebo response rates are high. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of licensed drugs to estimate magnitude of placebo response rate according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoints and to assess how this varies with stringency of the endpoint used to define response.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC and EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (through January 2021) to identify RCTs comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adult IBS patients. Studies assessed efficacy according to at least one of composite response, abdominal pain response, or stool response. Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, with dropouts assumed to be treatment failures and pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: There were 17 RCTs of licensed drugs versus placebo in IBS with constipation (4603 patients placebo) and 17 trials in IBS with diarrhea (3908 patients placebo). In IBS with constipation, according to FDA criteria, pooled composite, abdominal pain, and stool response rates with placebo over ≥6 of 12 weeks were 18.9%, 34.6%, and 30.1%, respectively. Evaluating response rates over ≥9 of 12 weeks led to placebo response rates of 4.3% for the composite endpoint, 24.5% for abdominal pain, and 7.7% for stool. In IBS with diarrhea, pooled placebo response rates according to FDA criteria were 16.2% for the composite endpoint, 40.2% for abdominal pain, and 16.2% for stool. Increasing the threshold used to define abdominal pain response from ≥30% improvement to ≥40% or ≥50% led to lower placebo response rates of 34.5% and 23.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Future RCTs should adhere to current FDA-recommended endpoints for IBS because these lead to lower placebo response rates. However, consideration should be given to further refining some of these to better differentiate between active drug and placebo.",Barberio B; Savarino EV; Black CJ; Ford AC,2022,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,20,5,e923-e944,10.1016/j.cgh.2021.08.025,"Barberio, B., Savarino, E.

38216286,Frequency of irritable bowel syndrome in spondyloarthritis: a multicentric cross-sectional study and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of symptoms and factors associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in axial spondyloarthritis (ax-SpA).
METHODS: In a cross-sectional multicentric study, consecutive patients with ax-SpA treated with biologics in five rheumatology departments were asked for IBS Rome IV criteria. Demographic data, lifestyle behaviours and disease characteristics were recorded. Second, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 500 patients with ax-SpA included, 124 reported IBS symptoms (25%). Female gender, unemployment, higher Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and worse Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index scores, multiple lines of biologics, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression and lower physical activity were associated with IBS symptoms. In multivariate model, the risk of IBS was associated with anxiety and physical inactivity. From the literature review, the prevalence of IBS in patients with SpA was 15.4% (8.8% to 23.3%). Meta-analysis of the five studies comparing the presence of IBS in patients with SpA (323/7292) and healthy controls (484/35587) showed a significant increase of IBS in patients with SpA (OR=1.59 (1.05 to 2.40)).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IBS symptoms was high in the ax-SpA population and should therefore be considered in the presence of gastrointestinal disorders. The presence of IBS symptoms was associated with anxiety and low physical activity in multivariate analysis. Patients with IBS symptoms tended to have more difficult to manage disease characterised by higher activity, worse functional score and multiple lines of treatment in univariate analysis.",Bernard J; Barnetche T; Amory C; Despres J; Vandersmissen M; Landrin J; Gaujoux-Viala C; Lukas C; Ruyssen-Witrand A; Truchetet ME; Vergne-Salle P; Mathieu S; Tournadre A,2024,RMD open,10,1,,10.1136/rmdopen-2023-003836,"Bernard, J., Barnetche, T., Amory, C., Despres, J., Vandersmissen, M., Landrin, J., Gaujoux-Viala, C., Lukas, C., Ruyssen-Witrand, A., Truchetet, M.

32009472,"Comparative of the Effectiveness and Safety of Biological Agents, Tofacitinib, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis: Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Biological agents are commonly used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). As new treatments, tofacitinib, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have demonstrated efficacy in treating UC. This network meta-analysis aims to determine the efficacy and safety of biological agents, tofacitinib, and FMT.
METHODS: A network meta-analysis was conducted by systematically searching the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Libraries. According to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of biological agents, tofacitinib, and FMT in UC. A random-effect model was chosen by the network meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity test and publication bias test were performed to determine the efficacy of treatments.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 16 RCTs and we found that all treatments were more effective than the placebos. A total of 21 comparisons were made to determine efficiency. We found that infliximab, vedolizumab, and FMT performed better curative effect in terms of absolute effects and relative ranks. Furthermore, there was no statistical difference in the efficacy of biological agents, tofacitinib, and FMT. Moreover, no treatments were found to increase the occurrence of adverse events when compared with placebos, except infliximab. However, vedolizumab seemed to reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with infliximab.
CONCLUSION: Of the biological agents, vedolizumab and infliximab were the most effective, suggesting that biological agents are still a better choice. Nevertheless, tofacitinib and FMT may be promising alternatives with high efficacies. However, more safety and maintenance studies need to be conducted in future for the acquisition of more accurate results.Abbreviations: FMT: Fecal microbiota transplantation; UC: Ulcerative colitis; RCTs: Randomized controlled trials; IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease; CD: Crohn's disease; IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome; CDI: Clostridium difficile infections; ITT: Intention-to-treat; RR: Relative risk; CI: Confidence interval; CrI: Credible intervals; IFX: Infliximab; ADA: Adalimumab; TFB: Tofacitinib; GLM: Golimumab; VDZ: Vedolizumab; PBO: Placebo; wk: week; F: Female; M: Male; AEs: Adverse events; SAEs: Serious adverse events; anti-TNF: Anti-tumor necrosis factors.",Zhou HY; Guo B; Lufumpa E; Li XM; Chen LH; Meng X; Li BZ,2021,Immunological investigations,50,4,323-337,10.1080/08820139.2020.1714650,"Zhou, H.

36014953,Heart Rate Variability-An Index of the Efficacy of Complementary Therapies in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as a functional and psychosomatic disease, reduces the quality of life and increases the risk of developing mental disorders. Deregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is one of the main causes of the disease. The objective of the present study was to identify the studies in which measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) were performed before and after therapeutic intervention, and to evaluate the effectiveness of IBS therapy in terms of a reduction of IBS symptoms and changes in autonomic tone. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in accordance with PRISMA standards. Six databases were searched for articles published before 2022: PubMed®, MEDLINE®, EBSCO, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were experimental design, diagnosis of IBS (medical and/or diagnosis in accordance with the Rome Criteria), non-pharmacological intervention, and HRV measurement before and after the intervention. The quality of the studies was assessed by JBI Critical appraisal. In total, 455 studies were identified, of which, sixwere included in the review. Expected changes in HRV (increase in parasympathetic activity) were observed in four of the six studies (interventions studied: ear acupressure, transcutaneous auricular vagusnerve stimulation, cognitive behavioral therapy with relaxation elements, yoga). In the same studies, therapeutic interventions significantly reduced the symptoms of IBS. The present review indicated that interventions under investigation improve the efficiency of the ANS and reduce the symptoms of IBS. It is advisable to include HRV measurements as a measure of the effectiveness of interventions in IBS therapy, and to assess autonomic changes as a moderator of the effectiveness of IBS therapy.",Mróz M; Czub M; Brytek-Matera A,2022,Nutrients,14,16,,10.3390/nu14163447,"Mróz, M., Czub, M., & Brytek-Matera, A.

34015282,Restoration of dysbiotic human gut microbiome for homeostasis.,"The human microbiome is a complex and dynamic ecosystem, and the imbalance of its microbial community structure from the normal state is termed dysbiosis. The dysbiotic gut microbiome has been proved to be related to several pathological conditions like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Colorectal Cancer (CRC), etc., and several other extra-intestinal conditions like Type 1 & 2 diabetes, obesity, etc. The complex gut microbial ecosystem starts to build before the birth of an individual. It is known to get affected by several factors such as birth mode, individual lifestyle, dietary practices, medications, and antibiotics. A dysbiotic microbiome can potentially hamper host homeostasis due to its role in immune modulation, metabolism, nutrient synthesis, etc. Restoration of the dysbiotic gut microbiome has emerged as a promising aid and a better therapeutic approach. Several approaches have been investigated to achieve this goal, including prebiotics and probiotics, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), extracellular vesicles, immune modulation, microbial metabolites, dietary interventions, and phages. This review discusses the various factors that influence the human microbiome with respect to their cause-effect relationship and the effect of gut microbiome compositional changes on the brain through the gut-brain axis. We also discuss the practices used globally for gut microbiome restoration purposes, along with their effectiveness.",Dixit K; Chaudhari D; Dhotre D; Shouche Y; Saroj S,2021,Life sciences,278,,119622,10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119622,"Dixit, K., Chaudhari, D., Dhotre, D., Shouche, Y., & Saroj, S.

33745570,Bifidobacterium longum W11: Uniqueness and individual or combined clinical use in association with rifaximin.,"BACKGROUNDS & AIMS: Strains belonging to bifidobacteria have been documented as being helpful in adults with intestinal dysbiosis conditions, like those related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This review aims to present the most relevant evidence regarding the efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum W11, a Bifidobacterium used in clinical settings for conditions such as IBS and inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: The following electronic databases were systematically searched up to August 2020: MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials (via CENTRAL), Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov.
RESULTS: Data arising from pooled analysis, 7 in vitro/pharmacological studies, 7 clinical trials including 1 randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled, showed that the probiotic strain B. longum W11 has been extensively studied for its efficacy in subjects with IBS with constipation, leading to a significant reduction in symptoms. In particular, its role in alleviating constipation was also confirmed in subjects for whom a low-calorie weight-loss diet led to the slowing down of gut motility. The probiotic characteristics of B. longum W11 were further demonstrated in the treatment of minimal hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic disease. The most remarkable trait of B. longum W11 is its non-transmissible antibiotic resistance, due to a nucleotide polymorphism mutation in the rpoB gene, making it resistant to antibiotics of the rifampicin group, including rifaximin. The co-administration of B. longum W11 and rifaximin in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease brought about a further significant improvement in the clinical condition compared to patients treated with rifaximin alone. B. longum W11 is a probiotic which could synergize with rifaximin as an adjuvant to antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken altogether these findings demonstrate the clinical role of the strain W11 both in some functional and in some inflammatory bowel diseases.",Di Pierro F; Pane M,2021,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,42,,15-21,10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.12.025,"Di Pierro, F., & Pane, M.

38821336,Metabolic biomarkers in irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by altered bowel habits and abdominal discomfort during defecation. It significantly impacts life quality and work productivity for those affected. Global data suggests a slightly higher prevalence in females than in males. Today, unambiguous diagnosis of IBS remains challenging due to the absence of a specific biochemical, histopathological, or radiological test. Current diagnosis relies heavily on thorough symptom evaluation. Efforts by the Rome committees have established standardized diagnostic criteria (Rome I-IV), improving consistency and clinical applicability. Recent studies in this framework, seem to have successfully employed metabolomics techniques to identify distinct metabolite profiles in breath and stool samples of IBS patients, differentiating them from healthy controls and those with other functional GI disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Building on this success, researchers are investigating the presence of similar metabolites in easily accessible biofluids such as urine, potentially offering a less invasive diagnostic approach. Accordingly, this review focuses on key metabolites specifically detected in IBS patients' biological specimens, with a focus on urinary metabolites, using various methods, particularly mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques, including gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS), and capillary electrophoresis-MS (CE-MS) metabolomics assays. These findings may make provision for a new set of non-invasive biomarkers for IBS diagnosis and management.",Vakili O; Adibi Sedeh P; Pourfarzam M,2024,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,560,,119753,10.1016/j.cca.2024.119753,"Vakili, O., Adibi Sedeh, P., & Pourfarzam, M.

32632072,[A Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Mind-Body Therapy on Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome].,"PURPOSE: Previous randomized controlled trials (RCT) found that mind-body therapy can improve the health outcomes of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify the combined effects of mind-body therapy on patients' IBS symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using various databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL CENTRAL, DBpia, RISS, and KISS. The primary outcome variables were IBS symptoms and quality of life; the secondary outcome variables were anxiety and depression. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.0 was used to analyze the extracted data. The effect size was calculated using standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Eleven final RCTs were used for this meta-analysis. Mind-body therapy was found to have a significant effect on the IBS patients' symptoms (SMD, -0.63; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.48), quality of life (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.66), anxiety (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.09), and depression (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.12).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis reveals that mind-body therapy significantly improves IBS patients' symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The results suggest that, in the future, appropriate mind-body therapy should be applied to Koreans suffering from IBS. Moreover, the therapy's long-term effects should be assessed.",Choi EH; Kim MJ; Lee EN,2020,Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing,50,3,385-400,10.4040/jkan.19224,"Choi, E. H., Kim, M. J., & Lee, E. N.

38483083,Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Diagnosis of Melanoma and Keratinocyte Carcinomas: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected healthcare. The real effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on skin cancer are still unclear, more than 3 years later. This study aims to summarise the pandemic's impact on skin cancer diagnosis and outcome. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, selecting studies comparing skin cancer diagnosis and prognosis post-pandemic with pre-pandemic data. A total of 27 papers were reviewed including 102,263 melanomas and 271,483 keratinocyte carcinomas. During the initial pandemic months (January-July 2020), melanoma surgeries dropped by 29.7% and keratinocyte carcinomas surgeries by 50.8%. Early pandemic tumours exhibited greater thickness and stage. In a long-term period beyond the initial months, melanoma surgeries decreased by 9.3%, keratinocyte carcinomas by 16.6%. No significant differences were observed in the Breslow thickness of melanomas after the start of the pandemic (mean difference 0.06, 95% confidence interval -0.46, 0.58). Melanomas operated on post-pandemic onset had an increased risk of ulceration (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.22-1.50). Keratinocyte carcinomas showed increased thickness and worsened stage post-pandemic. However, studies included were mostly retrospective and cross-sectional, reporting diverse data. This review indicates that the pandemic likely caused delays in skin cancer diagnosis and treatment, potentially impacting patient outcomes.",Díaz-Calvillo P; Muñoz-Barba D; Ureña-Paniego C; Maul LV; Cerminara S; Kostner L; Martínez López A; Arias-Santiago S,2024,Acta dermato-venereologica,104,,adv19460,10.2340/actadv.v104.19460,"Díaz-Calvillo, P., Muñoz-Barba, D., Ureña-Paniego, C., Maul, L.

40207278,Compendium of Bifidobacterium-based probiotics: characteristics and therapeutic impact on human diseases.,"The human microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms residing in and on the human body, plays a crucial role in maintaining health and preventing disease. Bifidobacterium species have shown remarkable therapeutic potential across a range of health conditions, thus being considered optimal probiotic bacteria. This review provides insights into the concept of probiotics and explores the impact of bifidobacteria on human health, focusing on the gastrointestinal, respiratory, skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems. It also integrates information on the available genetic bases underlying the beneficial effects of each bifidobacterial probiotic species on different aspects of human physiology. Notably, Bifidobacterium-based probiotics have proven effective in managing gastrointestinal conditions such as constipation, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Helicobacter pylori infections. These benefits are achieved by modulating the intestinal microbiota, boosting immune responses, and strengthening the gut barrier. Moreover, Bifidobacterium species have been reported to reduce respiratory infections and asthma severity. Additionally, these probiotic bacteria offer benefits for skeletal and muscular health, as evidenced by Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium breve, which have shown anti-inflammatory effects and symptom relief in arthritis models, suggesting potential in treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, probiotic therapies based on bifidobacterial species have shown promising effects in alleviating anxiety and depression, reducing stress, and enhancing cognitive function. Overall, this review integrates the extensive scientific literature now available that supports the health-promoting applications of probiotic Bifidobacterium species and underscores the need for further research to confirm their clinical efficacy across different body systems.",Bocchio F; Mancabelli L; Milani C; Lugli GA; Tarracchini C; Longhi G; De Conto F; Turroni F; Ventura M,2025,Microbiome research reports,4,1,2,10.20517/mrr.2024.52,"Bocchio, F., Mancabelli, L., Milani, C., Lugli, G.

36484871,"Fecal microbiota transplantation in childhood: past, present, and future.","BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been well described in the treatment of pediatric diseases; however, the latest updates regarding its use in children are unclear and the concepts involved need to be revisited.
DATA SOURCES: We performed advanced searches in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases using the keywords ""Fecal microbiota transplantation OR Fecal microbiota transfer"" in the [Title/Abstract] to identify relevant articles published in English within the last five years. To identify additional studies, reference lists of review articles and included studies were manually searched. Retrieved manuscripts (case reports, reviews, and abstracts) were assessed by the authors.
RESULTS: Among the articles, studies were based on the mechanism (n = 28), sample preparation (n = 9), delivery approaches (n = 23), safety (n = 26), and indications (n = 67), including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and recurrent C. difficile infection (rCDI; n = 21), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; n = 10), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; n = 5), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; n = 15), diabetes (n = 5), functional constipation (FC; n = 4), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n = 7).

33853113,Identification of Three Novel Susceptibility Loci for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Koreans in an Extended Genome-Wide Association Study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genome-wide association studies [GWAS] of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] in multiple populations have identified over 240 susceptibility loci. We previously performed a largest-to-date Asian-specific IBD GWAS to identify two new IBD risk loci and confirm associations with 28 established loci. To identify additional susceptibility loci in Asians, we expanded our previous study design by doubling the case size with an additional dataset of 1726 cases and 378 controls.
METHODS: An inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed between the previous and the new GWAS dataset, comprising a total of 3195 cases and 4419 controls, followed by replication in an additional 1088 cases and 845 controls.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis of Korean GWAS identified one novel locus for ulcerative colitis at rs76227733 on 10q24 [pcombined = 6.56 × 10-9] and two novel loci for Crohn's disease [CD] at rs2240751 on 19p13 [pcombined = 3.03 × 10-8] and rs6936629 on 6q22 [pcombined = 3.63 × 10-8]. Pathway-based analysis of GWAS data using MAGMA showed that the MHC and antigenic stimulus-related pathways were more significant in Korean CD, whereas cytokine and transcription factor-related pathways were more significant in European CD. Phenotype variance explained by the polygenic risk scores derived from Korean data explained up to 14% of the variance of CD whereas those derived from European data explained 10%, emphasizing the need for large-scale genetic studies in this population.

36860849,Modulation by luminal factors on the functions and migration of intestinal innate immunity.,"Luminal antigens, nutrients, metabolites from commensal bacteria, bile acids, or neuropeptides influence the function and trafficking of immune cells in the intestine. Among the immune cells in the gut, innate lymphoid cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells, play an important role for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis through a rapid immune response to luminal pathogens. These innate cells are influenced by several luminal factors, possibly leading to dysregulated gut immunity and intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and intestinal allergy. Luminal factors are sensed by distinct neuro-immune cell units, which also have a strong impact on immunoregulation of the gut. Immune cell trafficking from the blood stream through the lymphatic organ to lymphatics, an essential function for immune responses, is also modulated by luminal factors. This mini-review examines knowledge of luminal and neural factors that regulate and modulate response and migration of leukocytes including innate immune cells, some of which are clinically associated with pathological intestinal inflammation.",Higashiyama M; Miura S; Hokari R,2023,Frontiers in immunology,14,,1113467,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1113467,"Higashiyama, M., Miura, S., & Hokari, R.

36168183,Diagnostic yield of colonoscopy for organic disease in irritable bowel syndrome and its risk factors: A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is commonly performed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to rule out organic disease. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of organic disease detected at colonoscopy in IBS and its potential risk factors.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through January 2022. Observational studies that reported diagnostic yield of colonoscopy for organic disease including colorectal cancer (CRC), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or microscopic colitis (MC) in adult IBS patients were eligible. Pooled prevalence and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Of 2490 citations identified, 12 studies were eligible containing 28,630 patients with IBS undergoing colonoscopy. Pooled prevalence of CRC, IBD, and MC in IBS was 0.78%, 4.48%, and 2.35%, respectively. No difference in the yield for CRC, IBD, and MC was seen between IBS and non-IBS patients. CRC was rare in IBS patients without alarm symptoms or younger than 40 years (<0.1%). Pooled Prevalence of CRC (2.47% vs. 0.11%; RD 2.57%, 95% CI 0.37%-4.78%) and IBD (8.86% vs. 4.25%; RD 10.75%, 95% CI 4.81%-16.68%) was significantly higher in IBS patients with alarm symptoms compared with those without. IBD and MC were more likely to be detected at colonoscopy in IBS-D compared with IBS-C. The prevalence of CRC and MC was higher in IBS patients with older age than younger age.

Meta-analyses were conducted for between-group comparisons of adverse events using incidence rate ratios. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the certainty of the evidence with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation.ResultsOut of 3436 records, 22 trials were included in this review (28 otherwise eligible trials were excluded for not reporting adverse events). No significant differences were observed between groups for minor/moderate [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.00, 95% CI: 0.71-1.41, p = 1.00] or major (IRR: 1.77, 95% CI: 0.55-5.70, p = 0.98) adverse events. Incidence was low for both videoconferencing (one every 410 sessions) and in-person (one every 414 sessions). Eighteen trials (82%) were graded 'some concerns' or 'high' on overall risk of bias score, primarily due to bias arising from measurement and selection of the reported adverse events. Certainty grading was 'low' for adverse event outcomes.ConclusionThis study suggests that there is no clear evidence of a difference in adverse event incidence between in-person and videoconferencing physical rehabilitation or exercise interventions.

32640737,The Impact of Plant-Based Dietary Patterns on Cancer-Related Outcomes: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Long-term cancer survivors represent a sizeable portion of the population. Plant-based foods may enhance the prevention of cancer-related outcomes in these patients. We aimed to synthesize the current evidence regarding the impact of plant-based dietary patterns (PBDPs) on cancer-related outcomes in the general population and in cancer survivors. Considered outcomes included overall cancer mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and cancer recurrence. A rapid review was conducted, whereby 2234 original articles related to the topic were identified via Pubmed/Medline. We selected 26 articles, which were classified into studies on PBDPs and cancer outcomes at pre-diagnosis: vegan/vegetarian diet (N = 5), provegetarian diet (N = 2), Mediterranean diet (N = 13), and studies considering the same at post-diagnosis (N = 6). Pooled estimates of the associations between the aforementioned PBDPs and the different cancer outcomes were obtained by applying random effects meta-analysis. The few studies available on the vegetarian diet failed to support its prevention potential against overall cancer mortality when compared with a non-vegetarian diet (e.g., pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-1.06). The insufficient number of studies evaluating provegetarian index scores in relation to cancer mortality did not permit a comprehensive assessment of this association. The association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cancer mortality reached statistical significance (e.g., pooled HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79-0.89). However, no study considered the influence of prognostic factors on the associations. In contrast, post-diagnostic studies accounted for prognostic factors when assessing the chemoprevention potential of PBDPs, but also were inconclusive due to the limited number of studies on well-defined plant-based diets. Thus, whether plant-based diets before or after a cancer diagnosis prevent negative cancer-related outcomes needs to be researched further, in order to define dietary guidelines for cancer survivors.",Molina-Montes E; Salamanca-Fernández E; Garcia-Villanova B; Sánchez MJ,2020,Nutrients,12,7,,10.3390/nu12072010,"Molina-Montes, E., Salamanca-Fernández, E., Garcia-Villanova, B., & Sánchez, M.

38226581,Popular diets and nutritional assessment in the management of irritable bowel syndrome in inflammatory bowel disease: an overview of current evidence.,"There is an increasing interest in using popular diets to manage inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. These conditions are often associated with nutritional deficiencies, protein‐energy malnutrition, micronutrient malnutrition, altered body composition, and sarcopenia. While dietary interventions can be supportive in treating intestinal symptoms of adult IBD patients, it is important to note that current guidelines from major scientific societies do not recommend any specific dietary interventions in this field. This review aims to provide a summary of the current evidence on dietary‐nutritional management for patients with IBD, specifically when the disease appears to be in remission, but the patient continues to experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms or functional gastrointestinal symptoms. We focus on vital aspects, such as malnutrition and sarcopenia definitions, screening, and nutritional assessment. We then discuss in detail the most popular diets used for IBD management over the years, characterizing each one in terms of effects on gut inflammation, IBS‐like symptoms, and potential risk of malnutrition. These diets include a low‐fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet, a gluten‐free diet, a Mediterranean diet, and a plant‐based diet. To date, current evidence does not conclusively establish the optimal diet for patients with IBS, suggesting that personalized dietary approaches may be the best strategy.",Covello C; Becherucci G; Scaldaferri F; Laterza L; Gasbarrini A; Mentella MC,2024,Polish archives of internal medicine,134,2,,10.20452/pamw.16659,"Covello, C., Becherucci, G., Scaldaferri, F., Laterza, L., Gasbarrini, A., & Mentella, M.

37942144,Functional changes of default mode network and structural alterations of gray matter in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of whole-brain studies.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a brain-gut disorder with high global prevalence, resulting from abnormalities in brain connectivity of the default mode network and aberrant changes in gray matter (GM). However, the findings of previous studies about IBS were divergent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify common functional and structural alterations in IBS patients.
METHODS: Altogether, we identified 12 studies involving 194 IBS patients and 230 healthy controls (HCs) from six databases using whole-brain resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and voxel-based morphometry. Anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) was used to identify abnormal functional and structural changes as well as the overlap brain regions between dysconnectivity and GM alterations.
RESULTS: Findings indicated that, compared with HCs, IBS patients showed abnormal rs-FC in left inferior parietal gyrus, left lingual gyrus, right angular gyrus, right precuneus, right amygdala, right median cingulate cortex, and left hippocampus. Altered GM was detected in the fusiform gyrus, left triangular inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right superior marginal gyrus, left anterior cingulate gyrus, left rectus, left orbital IFG, right triangular IFG, right putamen, left superior parietal gyrus and right precuneus. Besides, multimodal meta-analysis identified left middle frontal gyrus, left orbital IFG, and right putamen as the overlapped regions.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that IBS patients have abnormal alterations in rs-FC and GM, and reveal brain regions with both functional and structural alterations. These results may contribute to understanding the underlying pathophysiology of IBS.

36757367,Targeting the gut-microbiota-brain axis in irritable bowel disease to improve cognitive function - recent knowledge and emerging therapeutic opportunities.,"The brain-gut axis forms a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cognitive brain areas. Disturbances to this system in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease have consequences for neuronal activity and subsequent cognitive function. The gut-microbiota-brain axis refers to the communication between gut-resident bacteria and the brain. This circuits exists to detect gut microorganisms and relay information to specific areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that in turn, regulate gut physiology. Changes in both the stability and diversity of the gut microbiota have been implicated in several neuronal disorders, including depression, autism spectrum disorder Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Correcting this imbalance with medicinal herbs, the metabolic products of dysregulated bacteria and probiotics have shown hope for the treatment of these neuronal disorders. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the intricate connections between the gut-microbiota and the brain. We discuss the contribution of gut microbiota to neuronal disorders and the tangible links between diseases of the GI tract with cognitive function and behaviour. In this regard, we focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) given its strong links to brain function and anxiety disorders. This adds to the growing body of evidence supporting targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate the gut microbiota for the treatment of brain/mental-health-related disease.",Tang H; Chen X; Huang S; Yin G; Wang X; Shen G,2023,Reviews in the neurosciences,34,7,763-773,10.1515/revneuro-2022-0155,"Tang, H., Chen, X., Huang, S., Yin, G., Wang, X., & Shen, G.

39402208,Digital Health Interventions Are Effective for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Self-Management: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) could be a valuable self-management tool for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little research exists on IBS-focused DHIs and their effectiveness. This review aimed to identify DHIs for IBS and evaluate their characteristics, effectiveness, and feasibility.
METHODS: Our study team, including patient partners, conducted a systematic review using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from database inception to May 2024. Experimental and observational studies evaluating DHIs designed for use by IBS patients were included. Data extraction and assessment included study and DHI characteristics, effectiveness outcomes (symptom severity, quality of life, psychological indices, patient empowerment), and feasibility measures (adherence, usability, user satisfaction). Study quality and bias were assessed using a modified checklist of Downs and Black.
RESULTS: Of the 929 identified, 13 studies of DHIs were included and deemed good quality on average (21,510 total participants) with six primary areas of focus: education, diet, brain-gut behavior skills, physiological support, health monitoring, and community engagement. Most DHIs were self-directed and reported statistically significant improvements in most effectiveness outcomes. Evidence suggests that DHIs focusing on brain-gut behavior skills or health monitoring may be most effective compared to other types of DHIs. However, their feasibility remains unclear, and the generalization of their impacts is limited.
CONCLUSION: This review underscores the potential of DHIs in supporting IBS patients and improving their outcomes. However, additional research is warranted for continued intervention use in this population, including assessments on feasibility, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient empowerment and experiences.",D'Silva A; Hua N; Modayil MV; Seidel J; Marshall DA,2025,Digestive diseases and sciences,70,2,644-664,10.1007/s10620-024-08672-7,"D'Silva, A., Hua, N., Modayil, M.

39796266,Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders and miRNA-Associated Disease: An Up-to-Date.,"Chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) impose significant health burdens globally. IBDs, encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are multifactorial disorders characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. On the other hand, IBS is one of the principal gastrointestinal tract functional disorders and is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Although the precise etiopathogenesis of these disorders remains unclear, mounting evidence suggests that non-coding RNA molecules play crucial roles in regulating gene expression associated with inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and tissue permeability, thus influencing disease progression. miRNAs have emerged as possible reliable biomarkers, as they can be analyzed in the biological fluids of patients at a low cost. This review explores the roles of miRNAs in IBDs and IBS, focusing on their involvement in the control of disease hallmarks. By an extensive literature review and employing bioinformatics tools, we identified the miRNAs frequently studied concerning these diseases. Ultimately, specific miRNAs could be proposed as diagnostic biomarkers for IBDs and IBS. Their ability to be secreted into biofluids makes them promising candidates for non-invasive diagnostic tools. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms through the ways in which they regulate gastrointestinal inflammation and immune responses could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of IBDs and IBS and open avenues for miRNA-based therapeutic interventions.",Giammona A; Galuzzi BG; Imperia E; Gervasoni C; Remedia S; Restaneo L; Nespoli M; De Gara L; Tani F; Cicala M; Guarino MPL; Porro D; Cerasa A; Lo Dico A; Altomare A; Bertoli G,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,1,,10.3390/ijms26010413,"Giammona, A., Galuzzi, B.

40770906,Microbiota-Host Interactions: Exploring Their Dynamics and Contributions to Human Diseases.,"Dysbiosis is the imbalance of bacterial composition, which would otherwise change the human host's metabolic activities and usual microbiota distribution. The outcomes would be as clear as day: losing beneficial bacteria in exchange for the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria, leading to diseases. It is crucial to unravel the dynamic roles of bacteria in maintaining human health to prevent and alleviate the said dysbiosis. To date, diet, lifestyle, age, and chemical exposures were cited as the leading cause of bacterial dysbiosis atop of genetic factors. This review aims to shed light on how bacterial interplays in maintaining human health and how bacteria-bacteria interaction may play a part in the surge of antimicrobial resistance. The intricate relationship of bacteria dynamics in the gut, skin and oral was detailed to understand how bacteria dysbiosis causes diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), acne vulgaris (AV), atopic dermatitis (AD), periodontitis and dental caries. Besides that, current interventions and limitations of therapeutic prospects entailing the growing concepts of rebiosis, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, microbiota transplantation, and the evolving phage therapy, were also discussed to breathe new life into the development of novel therapeutics against dysbiosis.",Chin SW; Low ZY; Tan WQ; Azman AS,2025,MicrobiologyOpen,14,4,e70043,10.1002/mbo3.70043,"Chin, S.

39336457,Oral and Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Due to Periodontitis: Systemic Implications and Links to Gastrointestinal Cancer: A Narrative Review.,"Periodontitis can disrupt oral and gut microbiota, leading to dysbiosis that affects overall systemic health. Besides the spread of periodontal pathogens by the hematogenous route, they can also be translocated into the gastrointestinal tract, possibly intervening in the neoplastic process in the gastrointestinal tract. This manuscript reviews the relationship between oral and gut microbiota due to periodontitis, discussing systemic health implications and potential links to gastrointestinal cancer. This article highlights the significance and effect of dysbiosis in the gut, emphasizing the importance of maintaining oral health to prevent systemic diseases. Lastly, it will go through therapeutic innovations such as probiotics and oral microbiota analysis tools for systemic disease detection. These findings will mark the integration of oral health management in clinical practice to lower systemic disease risk and improve overall patient outcomes. Aim of work: This manuscript aims to unravel the pathological interaction between oral and gut microbiota and their bidirectional effect on systemic diseases. Materials and methods: The review was performed using the MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases. Reviewed articles were published in English between the year 2015 and 2024. The search used keywords such as (""oral microbiota"" AND ""periodontal disease"") OR (""oral microbiota"" AND ""gastrointestinal cancer"") OR (""Porphyromonas gingivalis"" AND ""periodontal disease"") OR (""Helicobacter pylori"" AND ""gastric cancer"") OR (""gut microbiome"" AND ""inflammatory bowel disease"") OR (""oral microbiome"" AND ""systemic diseases""). Conclusions: The dysbiotic change in the oral cavity due to periodontitis is linked directly and indirectly to systemic diseases such as IBS, neurodegenerative diseases, muscle joint diseases, respiratory infections, and gastrointestinal cancer; this underscores the importance of maintaining oral hygiene for prophylaxis of oral diseases and the prevention of systemic diseases. A better understanding of the interconnections between oral health and systemic diseases will integrate oral health management to offer new prevention, diagnostic, and treatment opportunities to improve overall patient outcomes.",Sulaiman Y; Pacauskienė IM; Šadzevičienė R; Anuzyte R,2024,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",60,9,,10.3390/medicina60091416,"Sulaiman, Y., Pacauskienė, I.

However, the data on the relationship between H. pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are conflicting. This study aims to elucidate the association between H. pylori infection and IBS. PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and SCOPUS databases were searched to identify eligible English articles published up to December 2019. Cross-sectional studies, case-control studies and cohort studies reporting both prevalence of H. pylori infection and IBS were selected for the detailed review. The pooled odds ratio (ORs) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A total of 7269 individuals in four cross-sectional studies and six case-control studies were included. The prevalence of H. pylori infection ranged from 12.8% to 73.4% in the control group, and 9.7% to 72.1% in the IBS group. The combined OR for H. pylori infection was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.93-1.29, I2: 37.5%). In a subgroup analysis of IBS defined according to Rome criteria, the OR for H. pylori infection was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.93-1.30, I2 = 31.7%). In this meta-analysis, H. pylori infection was not significantly associated with IBS.

METHODS: A PubMed search from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2019, was conducted with the following search strategy: (fiber OR fibre) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review) AND (constipation OR body weight OR obesity OR irritable bowel syndrome OR inflammatory bowel disease). Meta-analyses that provided quantitative statistical analysis with a measured effect size were retrieved and accepted into this review. The following was extracted and entered into an Excel spreadsheet: number of publications included in the meta-analysis, number of total participants, fiber type and daily dose, pooled treatment effects for clinical endpoints, or summary relative risks.
RESULTS: Eighteen meta-analyses support dietary fiber supplementation for patients with constipation, weight loss, and IBS, but the significant heterogeneity and publication bias undermine the support for using dietary fiber supplementation in these conditions.

39867596,Efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation in gastrointestinal disorders: a systematic review.,"Dysfunction of the vagus nerve has been suggested as a contributing factor in various gastrointestinal disorders, prompting interest in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a non-pharmacological therapy. We performed a systematic review to determine the efficacy of invasive and non-invasive VNS in gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), functional constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gastroparesis. We applied a systematic search of the literature in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases in order to identify studies comparing VNS with an adequate control condition (sham stimulation) in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. The primary outcome was adequate symptom relief. Methodological quality was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analyses were not performed due to study heterogeneity. Seven randomized controlled trials investigating non-invasive VNS were included, with a total of 644 patients: FD (n = 426), IBD (n = 22), IBS (n = 92), and abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (n = 104), with a mean age ranging from 15 to 65 years. Non-invasive VNS significantly improved symptoms across all subsets of patients, as measured differently according to disease type, compared with sham stimulation. Adverse events, if reported, were low, with no serious complications. Putative mechanisms of action were assumed to be related to anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. Non-invasive VNS holds promise as a safe therapy for diverse gastrointestinal disorders. However, these findings are derived from studies with small sample sizes and provide preliminary insights. Further research is warranted to define its exact position within the therapeutic arsenal.",Veldman F; Hawinkels K; Keszthelyi D,2025,Gastroenterology report,13,,goaf009,10.1093/gastro/goaf009,"Veldman, F., Hawinkels, K., & Keszthelyi, D.

35561102,Delivery Methods of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal disorder and negatively impacts individuals' quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy appears effective for reducing symptoms in many irritable bowel syndrome patients. However, the optimal methods to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and the effective treatment dosage for patients with IBS remain unclear. This article aims to provide an update on cognitive behavioral therapy research in IBS, particularly considering the dose of treatment, route of delivery (in-person vs. web- and telephone-based delivery), and outcome measures. A systematic literature review was conducted using databases of PubMed, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science from 2008 through 2021. Twelve studies reporting randomized clinical trials comparing cognitive behavioral therapy delivered with in-person, telephone, and web for the management of IBS symptoms among adults with irritable bowel syndrome were found. The dose of treatment varied from 4 to 10 sessions. Six different scales measured various outcomes. No severe adverse reactions to cognitive behavioral therapy were reported. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for IBS symptoms regardless of the dose and the route of treatment. However, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of these randomized clinical trials due to the various cognitive behavioral therapy protocols, combined routes of therapy delivery, and different outcome measures used.",Chen LJ; Kamp K; Fang A; Heitkemper MM,,Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates,45,3,149-158,10.1097/SGA.0000000000000671,"Chen, L.

Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases until September 2023. Cross-sectional and case-control studies on diagnostic accuracy of bowel sound analysis for IBS were identified. We estimated the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and plotted a summary receiver operating characteristic curve and evaluated the area under the curve. Results Four studies were included. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87-0.97), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.94), 8.43 (95% CI, 4.81-14.78), 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03-0.15), and 118.86 (95% CI, 44.18-319.75), respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98).

38064310,Blood salvage and autotransfusion during orthotopic liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant cause of oncologic mortality worldwide. Liver transplantation represents a curative option for patients with significant liver dysfunction and absence of metastases. However, this therapeutic option is associated with significant blood loss and frequently requires various transfusions and intraoperative blood salvage for autotransfusion (IBS-AT) with or without a leukocyte reduction filter. This study aimed to analyze available evidence on long-term oncologic outcomes of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC with and without IBS-AT.
METHODS: Per PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of keywords ""Blood Salvage,"" ""Auto-transfusion,"" ""Hepatocellular carcinoma,"" and ""Liver-transplant"" was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Studies comparing operative and postoperative outcomes were screened and analyzed for review.
RESULTS: Twelve studies totaling 1704 participants were included for analysis. Length of stay, recurrence rates, and overall survival were not different between IBS-AT group and non IBS-AT group.
CONCLUSION: IBS-AT use is not associated with increased risk of recurrence in liver transplant for HCC even without leukocyte filtration. Both operative and postoperative outcomes are similar between groups. Comparison of analyzed studies suggest that IBS-AT is safe for use during liver transplant for HCC.",Hinojosa-Gonzalez DE; Salgado-Garza G; Tellez-Garcia E; Escarcega-Bordagaray JA; Bueno-Gutierrez LC; Madrazo-Aguirre K; Muñoz-Hibert MI; Diaz-Garza KG; Ramirez-Mulhern I; Alvarez de la Reguera-Babb R; Flores-Villalba E; Rodarte-Shade M; Gonzalez-Urquijo M,2024,Clinical transplantation,38,1,e15222,10.1111/ctr.15222,"Hinojosa-Gonzalez, D.

32229334,Mind-body treatments of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: An updated meta-analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a widespread chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder having bidirectional comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. This review focuses on psychological treatment of IBS, focusing on symptom severity rather than IBS diagnostic criteria. We chose this dimensional approach in order to assess mind-body effects as an alternative or complement to conventional medical treatment, which focuses on symptom relief. We calculated the effect sizes for various psychosocial-mind-body therapies (MBTs) for IBS symptoms in both children and adults. Therapies included meditation, relaxation, yoga, autogenic training, progressive relaxation, general training in stress coping, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, psycho-education, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. We performed a meta-regression analyses and mixed effects contrasts to find various outcome differences, and we analyzed their relative efficacy in both children and adults. We found 53 studies in 50 reports describing randomized controlled trials. Medium to high effect sizes were found across all methods compared with various controls, with possibly higher effects for children. We found no systematic differences among treatment methods. Meta-regression analyses showed no significant effect for the presence of psychophysiological training, meditation or explicit exposure procedures as treatment components, although most MBTs include exposure as a nonexplicit treatment characteristic, and many relaxation techniques have meditative characteristics. We conclude that there is considerable evidence that an array of mind-body and other psychological therapies can be effective complements to medical treatment for IBS symptom severity, with little evidence for relative superiority of any particular approach. We suggest that the various methods may operate through different mechanisms.",Shah K; Ramos-Garcia M; Bhavsar J; Lehrer P,2020,Behaviour research and therapy,128,,103462,10.1016/j.brat.2019.103462,"Shah, K., Ramos-Garcia, M., Bhavsar, J., & Lehrer, P.

Thus, a systematic review was carried out employing meta-analysis and network pharmacology to ascertain the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of CHM therapy.
METHODS: By conducting a systematic review, including literature search, screening, and data extraction, we identified 25 randomized controlled trials to assess CHM's effectiveness in treating irritable bowel syndrome alongside anxiety and depression. Network pharmacology was utilized to scrutinize the metabolite utility of CHM in addressing this condition. Potential primary mechanisms were synthesized using information sourced from the PubMed database.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies, including 2055 patients, were analyzed, revealing significant treatment efficacy for IBS-D in the trial group compared to controls [OR = 4.01, 95% CI (2.99, 5.36), I2 = 0%] Additionally, treatment for depression [SMD = -1.08, 95% CI (-1.30, -0.86), p < 0.00001, I2 = 68%; SDS: SMD = -1.69, 95% CI (-2.48, -0.90), p < 0.0001, I2 = 96%] and anxiety [HAMA: SMD = -1.29, 95% CI (-1.68, -0.91), p < 0.00001, I2 = 89%; SAS: SMD = -1.75, 95% CI (-2.55, -0.95), p < 0.00001, I2 = 96%] significantly improved in the trial group. Furthermore, the trial group exhibited a significantly lower disease relapse rate [OR = 0.30, 95% CI (0.20, 0.44), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%]. CHM treatment consistently improved IBS severity (IBS-SSS) and symptom scores. Network pharmacology analysis identified key chemical metabolites in traditional Chinese medicine formulations, including Beta-sitosterol, Stigmasterol, Quercetin, Naringenin, Luteolin, Kaempferol, Nobiletin, Wogonin, Formononetin, and Isorhamnetin. Utilizing the STRING database and Cytoscape v3.9.0 software, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed the top eight key targets: IL-6, TNF, PPARG, PTGS2, ESR1, NOS3, MAPK8, and AKT1, implicated in anti-inflammatory responses, antioxidant stress modulation, and neurotransmitter homeostasis maintenance.
CONCLUSION: Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) offers a promising and safe treatment approach for patients dealing with Diarrheal Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) accompanied by anxiety and depression; thus, indicating its potential for practical implementation. The most active metabolites of CHM could simultaneously act on the pathological targets of IBS-D, anxiety, and depression.The diverse scope of CHM's therapeutic role includes various aspects and objectives, underscoring its potential for broad utilization.",Bai C; Wang J; Wang Y; Liu H; Li J; Wang S; Bai Z; Guo R,2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,15,,1404738,10.3389/fphar.2024.1404738,"Bai, C., Wang, J., Wang, Y., Liu, H., Li, J., Wang, S., Bai, Z., & Guo, R.

39456718,Oxytocin/Oxytocin Receptor Signalling in the Gastrointestinal System: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.,"The neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) is involved in various physiological and pathological processes via the oxytocin receptor (OTR). While OT is most widely known as a reproductive system hormone and a nervous system neurotransmitter, the OT/OTR system has gradually gained much attention for its role in the gastrointestinal (GI) system, such as the GI motility, secretion, and bowel inflammatory reactions. Its importance in GI cancers has also been reported in the past few decades. The promising clinical observations have revealed OT's anti-nociceptive effect, protective effect over gut injury, and the potential of using microbiota to naturally increase endogenous OT levels, which shed a light on the management of GI disorders with lower side effects. However, no current comprehensive review is available on the actions of OT/OTR in the GI tract. This review aims to present the lesser-known role of the OT/OTR system in the GI tract, and the most recent findings are discussed regarding the distribution and functional role of OTR signalling in regulating (patho)physiological functions of the GI tract. Special emphasis is placed on its therapeutic potential for clinical management of GI disorders, such as GI pain, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The recent characterisation of the OTR's crystal structure has advanced research for designing and identifying new OTR-specific molecules. Future in-depth basic and clinical research is needed to further elucidate the involvement and detailed mechanism of OT/OTR in GI disorders, and the development of OTR-specific ligands.",Liu H; Yang G; Wang H,2024,International journal of molecular sciences,25,20,,10.3390/ijms252010935,"Liu, H., Yang, G., & Wang, H.

33880763,Noninvasive early diagnosis of intestinal diseases based on artificial intelligence in genomics and microbiome.,"The maturing development in artificial intelligence (AI) and genomics has propelled the advances in intestinal diseases including intestinal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). On the other hand, colorectal cancer is the second most deadly and the third most common type of cancer in the world according to GLOBOCAN 2020 data. The mechanisms behind IBD and IBS are still speculative. The conventional methods to identify colorectal cancer, IBD, and IBS are based on endoscopy or colonoscopy to identify lesions. However, it is invasive, demanding, and time-consuming for early-stage intestinal diseases. To address those problems, new strategies based on blood and/or human microbiome in gut, colon, or even feces were developed; those methods took advantage of high-throughput sequencing and machine learning approaches. In this review, we summarize the recent research and methods to diagnose intestinal diseases with machine learning technologies based on cell-free DNA and microbiome data generated by amplicon sequencing or whole-genome sequencing. Those methods play an important role in not only intestinal disease diagnosis but also therapy development in the near future.",Zhang W; Chen X; Wong KC,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,4,823-831,10.1111/jgh.15500,"Zhang, W., Chen, X., & Wong, K.

31741311,The Effect of Bifidobacterium on Reducing Symptomatic Abdominal Pain in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"Probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria, may improve abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are conflicting. Here, we systematically reviewed the efficacy of Bifidobacteria on abdominal pain in IBS. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from inception to 20 May 2019, without language or date restrictions. The search strategy comprised of the combination of three concepts: supplementation, abdominal pain, and IBS. Inclusion criteria included double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs featuring Bifidobacteria supplementation in Rome-diagnosed IBS patients. A total of 8 RCTs involving a total of 1045 patients with Rome diagnosed IBS were included. The dose of total Bifidobacteria ranged from 106 to > 1011 cfu (colony-forming unit) and duration of supplementation ranged between 2 and 8 weeks. Bifidobacteria was delivered through either intake of fermented milk products, encapsulation or via a malted milk beverage, with all studies assessing abdominal pain via a visual analogue Likert scale. From the studies included, 50% (n = 4) of studies found a statistically significant improvement in abdominal pain following Bifidobacteria supplementation compared to placebo, 38% (n = 3) of studies found non-significant improvements and 12% (n = 1) showed a statistically significant dose-response effect of improvement. The evidence shows a heterogeneity of effect for Bifidobacteria dependent upon strain, dosage and delivery method. While not all studies demonstrate significant improvements in abdominal pain, none of the selected studies reported an increase in pain or other adverse effects.",Pratt C; Campbell MD,2020,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,12,3,834-839,10.1007/s12602-019-09609-7,"Pratt, C., & Campbell, M.

40573159,Efficacy of a Low-FODMAP Diet on the Severity of Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Quality of Life in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal Disorders-A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Background: A low-FODMAP diet is considered as a potential supportive treatment approach in some gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet on the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with CASP tool and PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases resulted in the identification of fourteen randomized controlled trials. Results: Ten studies examined the effect of the low-FODMAP diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), three with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and one with symptomatic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). All interventions compared the low-FODMAP diet with another diet and lasted from 3 to 12 weeks. Most studies on IBS showed significant improvements in abdominal pain, bloating, and quality of life compared to control diets. In IBD, improvements were mainly observed in functional gastrointestinal symptoms, while no clear benefit was demonstrated in GERD. Heterogeneity in study designs, intervention durations, comparator diets, and outcome measures limited the ability to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions: Although a low-FODMAP diet may reduce symptoms in selected individuals, it is not universally necessary. Importantly, the diet's restrictive nature and potential long-term effects-such as nutritional deficiencies and alterations in gut microbiota-highlight the need for clinical supervision by dietitians with expertise in gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, in some cases, symptom improvement may be achievable through less restrictive changes, such as improving food hygiene and reducing intake of processed or high-sugar foods. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials with standardized endpoints and longer follow-up are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of the low-FODMAP diet across various gastrointestinal conditions.",Kuźmin L; Kubiak K; Lange E,2025,Nutrients,17,12,,10.3390/nu17122045,"Kuźmin, L., Kubiak, K., & Lange, E.

40575334,Diagnostic accuracy and quality of artificial intelligence models in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects approximately 9%-12% of the global population, presenting substantial diagnostic challenges due to symptom subjectivity and lack of definitive biomarkers.
AIM: To systematically examine the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models applied to various biomarkers in IBS diagnosis.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of six databases identified 18053 articles published up to May 31, 2024. Following screening and eligibility criteria, six observational studies involving 1366 participants from the United Kingdom, China, and Japan were included. Risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2, prediction model risk of bias assessment tool-AI, and transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis-AI tools. Key metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: The included studies applied AI models such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks to biomarkers like fecal microbiome composition, gas chromatography data, neuroimaging features, and protease activity. Diagnostic accuracy ranged from 54% to 98% (AUC: 0.61-0.99). Models using fecal microbiome data achieved the highest performance, with one study reporting 98% sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.99). While most studies demonstrated high methodological quality, significant variability in datasets, biomarkers, and validation methods limited meta-analysis feasibility and generalizability.
CONCLUSION: AI models show potential to improve IBS diagnostic accuracy by integrating complex biomarkers which will aid the development of algorithms to direct treatment strategies. However, methodological inconsistencies and limited population diversity underscore the need for standardized protocols and external validation to ensure clinical applicability.",Bhagavathula AS; Al Qady AM; Aldhaleei WA,2025,World journal of gastroenterology,31,23,106836,10.3748/wjg.v31.i23.106836,"Bhagavathula, A.

The current study aimed to examine white matter microstructural abnormalities and the reasons behind white matter impairment in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome by performing a meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging studies.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched until April 2024. Chosen articles based on our defined eligibility criteria were extracted for the data relating to fractional anisotropy and brain connectivity. Webplot digitizer was used to extract digital data. We used the latest version of STATA(ver18) to meta-analyze the data. Quality assessment of studies was done using a critical appraisal tool. Egger's test for minor study effects assessed the publication bias.
RESULTS: 543 IBS cases and 472 healthy controls were included in this study. The mean age of the case and control group was 35.2 ± 17.4 and 33.6 ± 15.8 (mean ± SD), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in age between groups (p > 0.05).

35456802,A Combination of Mediterranean and Low-FODMAP Diets for Managing IBS Symptoms? Ask Your Gut!,"Among other factors, food intolerance is cardinal in triggering irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in a significant percentage of patients. As a result, specific dietary patterns are the first-line therapeutic approach. The low-FODMAP diet (LFD) is gaining ground as the most well-documented diet intervention that significantly reduces IBS symptoms. Though the LFD improves symptoms, the diet's impact on intestinal low-grade inflammation, one of the cardinal mechanisms contributing to symptom development, remains doubtful. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is recommended for chronic low-grade inflammation-related diseases because of its anti-inflammatory properties, derived predominantly from olive oil and phenolic compounds. Thus far, the role of a modified LFD, enriched with the MedDiet's anti-inflammatory components, has not been evaluated in IBS patients. This review aims to examine the hypothesis of a potential combination of the immunomodulatory effects of the MedDiet with the LFD to improve IBS symptoms.",Kasti A; Petsis K; Lambrinou S; Katsas K; Nikolaki M; Papanikolaou IS; Hatziagelaki E; Triantafyllou K,2022,Microorganisms,10,4,,10.3390/microorganisms10040751,"Kasti, A., Petsis, K., Lambrinou, S., Katsas, K., Nikolaki, M., Papanikolaou, I.

37094068,Role of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in the enteric nervous system in health and disease.,"Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a crucial protein that controls the immune system's reaction to bacterial and viral infections. As a pattern-recognition receptor, STING is found in immune cells as well as in neurons and glia in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Recent studies have linked STING to the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which are characterized by chronic inflammation and dysregulation of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the digestive tract. STING plays a crucial role in the pathway that induces the production of interferon in response to viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS). A new study by Dharshika et al. in the current issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility has demonstrated distinct roles for STING in enteric neurons and glia, namely activation of STING leads to IFN-β production in enteric neurons but not in glia and reducing STING activation in enteric glia does not modulate the severity of Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis or subsequent loss of enteric neurons. Rather, the role of STING in enteric glia is related to enhancing autophagy. STING can influence gastrointestinal motility and barrier function and therefore be involved in the pathophysiology of IBS and IBD. This mini review highlights the current knowledge of STING in the pathophysiology of CNS and gastrointestinal diseases as well as these newly uncovered roles STING in enteric neurons and glia.",Balasubramaniam A; Srinivasan S,2023,Neurogastroenterology and motility,35,7,e14603,10.1111/nmo.14603,"Balasubramaniam, A., & Srinivasan, S.

39839290,Efficacy of fermented foods in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: Fermented foods (FFs) may theoretically benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but the role of FFs for IBS patients in the real world is inconsistent and has not been systematically assessed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine this issue.
METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to August 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of FFs in IBS were eligible for the analysis. Two authors independently screened studies and extracted data. Data were pooled using relative risk (RR) of dichotomous data and standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data.
RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs with 1,264 IBS patients were included. There were 12 RCTs involving 975 patients providing primary outcomes which was defined as symptom relief. The proportion of symptom relief was associated with the administration of FFs (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.42, p = 0.01, I 2 = 0%). For secondary outcomes, FFs also exerted a beneficial effect on global symptoms scores (SMD = -0.15; 95% CI -0.29 to -0.02, p = 0.02, I 2 = 46%), but no significant improvement on abdominal pain scores and bloating scores. Subgroup analysis showed that fermented milk had a beneficial effect on symptom relief (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39, p = 0.04, I 2 = 0%).
CONCLUSION: Fermented foods, especially fermented milk with probiotics properties, appear to be efficacious in irritable bowel syndrome. However, given the limitations of current evidence, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution.

33110455,Noninvasive Biomarkers of Gut Barrier Function in Patients Suffering from Diarrhea Predominant-IBS: An Update.,"The intestinal barrier plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients and in preventing the entry of pathogenic microorganisms and toxic molecules. Several studies have shown a compromised intestinal barrier associated with low-grade inflammation in the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly in IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). In light of these new data, IBS is no longer considered a functional disease but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that has yet to be carefully studied. Therefore, investigating the integrity and function of the intestinal barrier is now essential to improving knowledge of the pathophysiology of IBS-D and to improving the management of IBS-D patients. However, the study of the intestinal barrier must clarify some still unsolved methodological aspects and propose standardised assays before becoming a useful diagnostic tool.

39684769,Inflammasomes in Intestinal Disease: Mechanisms of Activation and Therapeutic Strategies.,"NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) implicated in the innate immune sensing of pathogens and damage signals. NLRs act as sensors in multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes. Inflammasome activity is necessary for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, although their aberrant activation contributes to the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases. In this review, we summarize the main features of the predominant types of inflammasomes involved in gastrointestinal immune responses and their implications in intestinal disease, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), celiac disease, and Colorectal Cancer (CRC). In addition, we report therapeutic discoveries that target the inflammasome pathway, highlighting promising novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of intestinal diseases. Collectively, our understanding of the mechanisms of intestinal inflammasome activation and their interactions with other immune pathways appear to be not fully elucidated. Moreover, the clinical relevance of the efficacy of inflammasome inhibitors has not been evaluated. Despite these limitations, a greater understanding of the effectiveness, specificity, and reliability of pharmacological and natural inhibitors that target inflammasome components could be an opportunity to develop new therapeutic options for the treatment of intestinal disease.",Scalavino V; Piccinno E; Giannelli G; Serino G,2024,International journal of molecular sciences,25,23,,10.3390/ijms252313058,"Scalavino, V., Piccinno, E., Giannelli, G., & Serino, G.

35942522,Randomised clinical trial and meta-analysis: mesalazine treatment in irritable bowel syndrome-effects on gastrointestinal symptoms and rectal biomarkers of immune activity.,"BACKGROUND: Low-grade immune activation in the gut is a potential treatment target in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
AIMS: To determine improvement in IBS symptoms after mesalazine treatment, and the utility of measures of immune activity in the rectal mucosa METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicentre trial in subjects with IBS (Rome III criteria), with an eight-week treatment period of mesalazine 2400 mg or plcebo once-daily. The primary endpoint was the global assessment of satisfactory relief of IBS symptoms in ≥50% of weeks during intervention. IBS symptoms were also measured with the IBS severity scoring system; immune activity was measured by mucosal patch technology. A post hoc meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of mesalazine in IBS was added.
RESULTS: Of 181 included patients, 91 received mesalazine and 90 received placebo. The primary endpoint was met by 32 (36%) patients after mesalazine and 27 (30%) after placebo (p = 0.40). There were no differences in response rates related to IBS subtype or post-infection symptom onset. More reduction of abdominal bloating was noted in the mesalazine group (p = 0.02). The meta-analysis showed no effect of mesalazine on IBS symptoms. No mucosal patch technology measure could predict response to mesalazine, and found no differences in the effects of intervention on levels of immune markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine is ineffective in reducing IBS symptoms. Rectal measures of immune activity by the mucosal patch technology cannot predict a higher chance of response to mesalazine.",Castro Tejera V; Öhman L; Aabakken L; Fellström B; Hausken T; Hovde Ø; Hreinsson JP; Lindberg G; Venge P; Simrén M; Törnblom H,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,56,6,968-979,10.1111/apt.17182,"Castro Tejera, V., Öhman, L., Aabakken, L., Fellström, B., Hausken, T., Hovde, Ø., Hreinsson, J.

40831637,A bibliometric analysis of global research status and trends in irritable bowel syndrome and gut microbiota metabolites.,"BACKGROUND: Metabolites derived from the gut microbiota are substantial contributors to the pathophysiology of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). As our understanding of the mechanisms underlying gut microbiota metabolites advances, significant progress has been made in research exploring the correlation between gut microbiota metabolites and IBS. Nevertheless, a comprehensive synthesis of research foci and trends in this domain is still lacking. Consequently, integrating scientometric methods with a range of analytical tools can facilitate the identification of key research areas and potential future study directions.
METHODS: The present study employed scientometric tools, including VOSviewer, Bibliometrix software, CiteSpace, Tableau, and R software, to collect and analyze research literature on IBS and gut microbiota metabolites. This comprised an analysis of journal publications and their impact, the identification of prolific authors, the establishment of national research collaboration networks, and the co-occurrence analysis of keywords.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that, following screening, a total of 1,489 documents were obtained, with a gradual increase in the number of publications starting from 2006. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom have been identified as the primary hubs of this research field. The leading research institutions were identified as University College Cork, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of California. In the domain of research under discussion, John F. Cryan, Timothy G. Dinan, and Gerard Clarke are the most prominent authors. Multiple analyses of the keywords revealed that research on gut microbiota metabolites in irritable bowel syndrome primarily focuses on the functions and mechanisms of action of specific metabolites (1). Emerging research hotspots on gut microbial metabolites influencing IBS are centered on bile acids. In contrast, chain fatty acids have been the most studied metabolites in past research.

38111141,The role of the gastrointestinal barrier in obesity-associated systemic inflammation.,"Systemic inflammation is a key contributor to the onset and progression of several obesity-associated diseases and is thought to predominantly arise from the hyperplasia and hypertrophy of white adipose tissue. However, a growing body of works suggests that early changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) barrier may contribute to both local, within the GI lining, and systemic inflammation in obesity. Intestinal barrier dysfunction is well-characterized in inflammatory GI disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and is known to contribute to systemic inflammation. Thus, drawing parallels between GI disorders, where intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation are prominent features, and obesity-induced GI manifestations may provide insights into the potential role of the intestinal barrier in systemic inflammation in obesity. This review summarizes the current literature surrounding intestinal barrier dysfunction in obesity and explores the potential role of intestinal hyperpermeability and intestinal barrier dysfunction in the development of systemic inflammation and GI dysfunction in obesity.",Acciarino A; Diwakarla S; Handreck J; Bergola C; Sahakian L; McQuade RM,2024,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,25,3,e13673,10.1111/obr.13673,"Acciarino, A., Diwakarla, S., Handreck, J., Bergola, C., Sahakian, L., & McQuade, R.

38253876,Irritable bowel syndrome in children: the placebo response rate and influencing factors a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is common in children and exhibits a high placebo response. This study was to explore the placebo response rate and its influencing factors in children with irritable bowel syndrome.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed on Pubmed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and CBM from database inception to March 2022. Randomized controlled trials of irritable bowel syndrome in children were included in the study. The primary outcome was the placebo response rate of improvement.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included, with 445 patients in the placebo group. The rate of improvement and abdominal pain disappearance were 28.2% (95% CI, 16.6-39.9%) and 5% (95% CI, 0-18.4%). The placebo response based on the abdominal pain score was 0.675 (95% CI, 0.203-1.147). The mode of administration (P < 0.01), dosing schedule (P < 0.01), and clinical outcome assessor (P = 0.04) have a significant impact on the magnitude of placebo effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The placebo response rate for pediatric irritable bowel syndrome was 28.2%. In clinical trials, reducing dosing frequency, selecting appropriate dosage forms, and using patient-reported outcomes can help mitigate the placebo effect.
IMPACT: This is the first meta-analysis to assess the placebo response rates for improvement and disappearance in children with IBS. The finding suggested that the mode of administration, dosing schedule, and clinical outcome assessor could potentially influence the magnitude of the placebo effect in children with IBS. This study would provide a basis for estimating sample size in clinical trial design with a placebo control.",Cai LL; Li X; Cai QH; Guo SX; Zhang Y; Sun WC; Zhao ZH; Hu SY,2024,Pediatric research,95,6,1432-1440,10.1038/s41390-023-02996-2,"Cai, L.

35295757,Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to assess both the short- and long-term efficacy of FMT in IBS.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched through September 2021. RCTs recruiting adult patients with IBS that compared FMT with placebo with dichotomous data of response to therapy were eligible. Dichotomous data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of symptom not improving after therapy. RR was also pooled for adverse events (AEs). Continuous data were calculated using a mean difference for IBS-Quality of Life (IBS-QoL). GRADE methodology was used to assess quality of evidence.
RESULTS: The search strategy generated 658 citations. Seven RCTs comprising 472 patients with IBS were included. FMT was not associated with a significant improvement in global symptom in IBS at 12 weeks in comparison with placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43-1.31) with high heterogeneity between studies (I2 87%). Subgroup analyses showed that FMT was superior to placebo when administered via colonoscopy or gastroscope (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.96; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.99, respectively, while FMT was inferior to placebo when administered via oral capsules (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.35). FMT induced a significant improvement in IBS-QoL compared to placebo (mean difference 9.39, 95% CI 3.86-14.91) at 12 weeks. No significant difference in the total number of AEs was observed between FMT and placebo (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.59-2.47). FMT did not significantly improve global symptom in IBS at 1-year follow-up compared with placebo (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72-1.12). The GRADE quality evidence to support recommending FMT in IBS was very low.
CONCLUSION: IBS patients may benefit from FMT when administered via colonoscopy or gastroscope. FMT may improve the quality of life of IBS. The long-term use of FMT in IBS warrants further investigation. There is very-low-quality evidence to support recommending FMT in IBS.",Wu J; Lv L; Wang C,2022,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,12,,827395,10.3389/fcimb.2022.827395,"Wu, J., Lv, L., & Wang, C.

38613127,Efficacy of a Low-FODMAP Diet for Coeliac Patients with Persistent IBS-like Symptoms despite a Gluten-Free Diet: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Persistent symptoms in coeliac disease (CD) can be due to not only poor gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence and complications of CD, but also functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the role of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is well-established in IBS, little data are available on its role in coeliac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite a GFD. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for studies evaluating the role of FODMAPs and/or a low-FODMAP diet in coeliac patients with persistent symptoms. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 16 January 2024 for eligible full-text papers. The study protocol was registered on Open Science Framework. Results: A total of 239 records were identified, and six papers were included. Of these, four were interventional studies comparing a low-FODMAP GFD to a regular GFD for persistent symptoms in 115 total coeliac patients (two randomized controlled trials and two open-label studies). A low-FODMAP GFD for a minimum of 4 weeks was significantly more effective than a regular GFD in reducing symptoms (p < 0.05 in 3/4 studies). Dietary FODMAP content of a conventional GFD was significantly lower than that of non-coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet (both p < 0.05), especially regarding high-FODMAP grain products. However, coeliac patients consumed more servings of fruits/vegetables high in FODMAP. No relationship between FODMAP intake and persistence of symptoms was reported. Conclusions: A low-FODMAP diet may be beneficial for uncomplicated celiac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite strict adherence to a GFD.",Lusetti F; Schiepatti A; Scalvini D; Maimaris S; Biagi F,2024,Nutrients,16,7,,10.3390/nu16071094,"Lusetti, F., Schiepatti, A., Scalvini, D., Maimaris, S., & Biagi, F.

34976247,Probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome - is the quest for the right strain over? Rapid review of existing guidelines and recommendations.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGIDs) and disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs) - has emerged as an important medical problem with an impact on health care systems, affecting patients' quality of life. The management of IBS consists of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments; however, the data of their long-term efficacy are scarce. Modulation of gastrointestinal microbiota, by means of probiotics and prebiotics, is often sought and advertised as a popular treatment modality in IBS. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) awaits recommendations for IBS treatment and requires more methodological assessments. To date, numerous guidelines and recommendations have been published on the role of probiotics in IBS. Because no probiotic claim for probiotics in foods has yet been granted by the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA), medical practitioners still recommend probiotics on the basis of available literature and recommendations released by independent health authorities. We aimed to summarize published formal recommendations and guidelines regarding the clinical effectiveness of available probiotic strains and conduct a random-effects meta-analysis of outcomes for which ≥ 2 studies contributed data on the same probiotic strain recommended to adults with IBS. Based on available and most recent guidelines, we report that probiotics, as a group, may be an effective treatment for global symptoms and abdominal pain in IBS, with the strongest effect for genus Lactobacillus. Our current and updated meta-analysis is in line with several reports documenting significant effects of Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp299v) in reducing the risk of global symptoms and their persistence, which could assist clinicians in making the choice for the right probiotic strain in IBS patients.",Marlicz W; Skonieczna-Żydecka K; Krynicka P; Łoniewski I; Rydzewska G,2021,Przeglad gastroenterologiczny,16,4,369-382,10.5114/pg.2021.111766,"Marlicz, W., Skonieczna-Żydecka, K., Krynicka, P., Łoniewski, I., & Rydzewska, G.

39166955,Unraveling the genetic susceptibility of irritable bowel syndrome: integrative genome-wide analyses in 845 492 individuals: a diagnostic study.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) significantly impacts individuals due to its prevalence and negative effect on quality of life. Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only identified a small number of crucial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), not fully elucidating IBS's pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genomic loci at which common genetic variation influences IBS susceptibility.
METHODS: Combining independent cohorts that in total comprise 65 840 cases of IBS and 788 652 controls, the authors performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IBS. The authors also carried out gene mapping and pathway enrichment to gain insights into the underlying genes and pathways through which the associated loci contribute to disease susceptibility. Furthermore, the authors performed transcriptome analysis to deepen their understanding. IBS risk models were developed by combining clinical/lifestyle risk factors with polygenic risk scores (PRS) derived from the GWAS meta-analysis. The authors detect the phenotype association for IBS utilizing PRS-based phenome-wide association (PheWAS) analyses, linkage disequilibrium score regression, and Mendelian randomization.
RESULTS: The GWAS meta-analysis identified 10 IBS risk loci, seven of which were novel (rs12755507, rs34209273, rs34365748, rs67427799, rs2587363, rs13321176, rs1546559). Multiple methods identified nine promising IBS candidate gene ( PRRC2A, COP1, CADM2, LRP1B, SUGT1, MED12L, P2RY14, PHF2, SHISA6 ) at 10 GWAS loci. Transcriptome validation also revealed differential expression of these genes. Phenome-wide associations between PRS-IBS and nine traits (neuroticism, diaphragmatic hernia, asthma, diverticulosis, cholelithiasis, depression, insomnia, COPD, and BMI) were identified. The six diseases (asthma, diaphragmatic hernia, diverticulosis, insomnia major depressive disorder and neuroticism) were found to show genetic association with IBS and only major depressive disorder and neuroticism were found to show causality with IBS.
CONCLUSION: The authors identified seven novel risk loci for IBS and highlighted the substantial influence on genetic risk harbored. The authors' findings offer novel insights into etiology and phenotypic association of IBS and lay the foundation for therapeutic targets and interventional strategies.",Huang W; Zhang L; Ma Y; Yu S; Lyu Y; Tong S; Wang J; Jiang R; Meng M; Wu Y; Luo R; Qiu X; Sha W; Chen H,2025,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",111,1,210-220,10.1097/JS9.0000000000002039,"Huang, W., Zhang, L., Ma, Y., Yu, S., Lyu, Y., Tong, S., Wang, J., Jiang, R., Meng, M., Wu, Y., Luo, R., Qiu, X., Sha, W., & Chen, H.

PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases, updated to January 2023, were searched. The present study employed mean difference and a 95% confidence interval (CI) to examine the efficacy of the intervention. Heterogeneity was assessed through inconsistency statistics (I2). Out of the 299 studies identified, a total of 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comprising 272 participants, met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the control group, physical exercise significantly decreased the concentrations of FGF23 (MD: -102.07 Pg/mL, 95% CI: -176.23.47, -27.91 I2= 97%, p = 0.001), and a significantly increased the concentrations of Klotho protein: (MD: 158.82 Pg/mL, 95% CI: 123.33, -194.31, I2 = 0%, p = 0.001). The results of our study indicated that the exercise has a direct relationship with Klotho-FGF23 axis. We can conclude that physical exercise in patients with CKD produces beneficial effects on the pathophysiological components related to this disease, including cardiorespiratory fitness and vascular functions. As observed, both endurance and aerobic physical exercise increase Klotho production and decrease FGF23 levels. Evidence indicates that exercise attenuates the progression of CKD, improves uremic parameters and down-regulates inflammation-related markers.",Castillo RF; Pérez RG; González AL,2024,International journal of medical sciences,21,2,332-340,10.7150/ijms.90195,"Castillo, R.

In recent years, the influence of bidirectional communication between the gut and brain on gut physiology, emotions, and behavior has been demonstrated.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What mechanisms underlie the development of functional gastrointestinal complaints in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and IBD? What therapeutic approaches arise from this?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Narrative review.
RESULTS: The pathogenesis of IBS involves interactions between psychosocial factors, genetics, and microbiota as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. The interplay between stress and visceral hypersensitivity is of central importance.

39817370,Meta-Analysis: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition in Adults With Ulcerative Colitis.,"BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an established dietary therapy for Crohn's disease but its role in ulcerative colitis remains unclear.
AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of EEN in adults with active ulcerative colitis and compare variations in treatment protocols, safety, tolerability and adherence.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Emcare, CINAHL, Web of Science and trial registries for articles published from inception until July 21, 2024. We included all experimental and observational studies that described the use of EEN in adults with active ulcerative colitis. This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022319584).
RESULTS: Of 3273 articles screened, we included 10 studies (334 adults). Overall, there was no difference between EEN and comparator for ulcerative colitis remission induction (median follow-up 14 days, risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.85; 2 studies). In acute severe ulcerative colitis, there was no difference between EEN and comparator for corticosteroid failure (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48-1.20; 2 studies) or risk of colectomy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.51-1.51, n = 2 studies) during index admission. The pooled discontinuation rate was 3% (95% CI 0-10; 9 studies). There was heterogeneity in trial design, methodology and assessment of outcomes.
CONCLUSION: EEN was well tolerated with low therapy discontinuation in adults with active ulcerative colitis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of EEN as an adjunctive therapy to standard of care. Further, well-designed studies with reproducible methodology and endpoints are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness.

40887792,"Sleep Disturbances, Fatigue and Immune Markers in the Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease, a Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are gastrointestinal (GI) diseases characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel patterns. Fatigue and sleep disturbances are prevalent in these GI diseases, with a bidirectional relationship suggested between GI symptoms and sleep quality. If poor sleep results in increased GI symptoms, improving sleep quality may alleviate symptoms. However, if GI symptom burden independently drives poor sleep, alleviating symptoms by disease modification rather than targeting sleep should be the goal of management. Therefore, we aimed to determine if there is a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms that influences sleep disturbances and/or fatigue.
METHODS: A systematic literature search in five databases was conducted using PRISMA guidelines to identify studies addressing fatigue, sleep disturbances, and GI diseases until June 2025. Inclusion criteria were original articles with confirmed GI disease diagnosis and healthy control groups. Data extraction included participant demographics, assessment tools, inflammatory findings, medication use, and disease severity. Quality assessment utilized the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
KEY RESULTS: Of 14,664 articles, 18 studies were included: 7 focused on IBS, 9 on IBD, and 2 on both IBS and IBD. Findings revealed increased fatigue and sleep disturbances in GI patients compared to controls, with IBS patients reporting more fatigue and sleep disturbances than IBD. GI disease severity was strongly associated with sleep quality and fatigue levels.

38158460,Getting the BS out of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea (IBS-D): Let's Make a Diagnosis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is diagnosed when chronic symptoms of abdominal pain accompany loose stools, and alarm features, such as fever, anemia, rectal bleeding, and weight loss are absent. This combination of symptoms makes structural disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, unlikely, but does not exclude other conditions that cause these symptoms. The question is whether making a ""positive diagnosis"" of IBS-D based on symptoms alone and instituting therapy based on that diagnosis still makes sense.
RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical observations suggest that at least two-thirds of cases of IBS-D can be explained by three mechanisms: a) food intolerances (~ 30-40%), b) bile acid diarrhea (~ 20-30%), and c) disturbed microbial flora (~ 15-20%). Other conditions that are less frequent but can cause IBS symptoms or be confused with IBS include: celiac disease, microscopic colitis, mastocytosis/mast cell activation, and drug side-effects. Many cases of IBS-D have a discoverable, underlying cause that can direct therapy more efficiently.",Frissora CL; Schiller LR,2024,Current gastroenterology reports,26,1,20-29,10.1007/s11894-023-00909-1,"Frissora, C.

33022298,What has social neuroscience learned from hyperscanning studies of spoken communication? A systematic review.,"A growing body of literature examining the neurocognitive processes of interpersonal linguistic interaction indicates the emergence of neural alignment as participants engage in oral communication. However, questions have arisen whether the study results can be interpreted beyond observations of cortical functionality and extended to the mutual understanding between communicators. This review presents evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning studies of interbrain synchrony (IBS) in which participants communicated via spoken language. The studies are classified into: knowledge sharing; turn-taking speech co-ordination; cooperation, problem-solving and creativity; and naturalistic discussion paradigms according to the type of interaction specified in each study. Alignment predominantly occurred in the frontal and temporo-parietal areas, which may reflect activation of the mirror and mentalizing systems. We argue that the literature presents a significant contribution to advancing our understanding of IBS and mutual understanding between communicators. We end with suggestions for future research, including analytical approaches and experimental conditions and hypothesize that brain-inspired neural networks are promising techniques for better understanding of IBS through hyperscanning.",Kelsen BA; Sumich A; Kasabov N; Liang SHY; Wang GY,2022,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,132,,1249-1262,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.09.008,"Kelsen, B.

35675626,Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Disorders: Clinical Updates in Women's Health Care Primary and Preventive Care Review.,"Lower gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and associated symptoms account for a large number of health care visits each year. Many women visit their obstetrician-gynecologists more often than their primary care physicians or use them as primary health care providers. Many gynecologic and lower GI disorders share symptoms, such as lower abdominal or pelvic pain and bloating. Some diseases are more common in women compared with men, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or warrant special consideration in women, for example, for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This monograph outlines the major diseases that affect the lower GI tract and reviews epidemiology, pathology, presentation, and treatment of these diseases.

31858910,The Possible Role of Pathogenic and Non-Pathogenic Bacteria in Initiation and Exacerbation of Celiac Disease; A Comprehensive Review.,"Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, generally of the proximal intestine, that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals triggered by the ingestion of gluten. The incidence and frequency of CD are increasing, and it is predicted that CD affects approximately 1% of the people worldwide. The common clinical manifestations of CD are divided in two sections, including classic and non-classic symptoms that can be created in childhood and adulthood. The relationship between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria with CD is complex and multidirectional. In previous published studies, results demonstrated the triggering impact of bacteria, viruses, and parasites on initiation and development of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Different studies revealed the inducing effect of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria on CD. However, increasing evidence proposes that some of these microorganisms can also play several positive roles in CD process. Although information of the pathogenesis of the CD is quickly expanding, the possible role of bacteria needs further examination. In conclusion, with respect to the possible correlation between different bacteria in CD, the current review-based study aims to discuss the possible relationship between CD and pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and to show various and significant aspects of mechanisms involved in the CD process.",Azimi T; Nasser A; Shariati A; Shiadeh SMJ; Safari H; Alizade-Sani M; Taghipour A; Dehghan A,2020,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,21,6,452-466,10.2174/1389201021666191219160729,"Azimi, T., Nasser, A., Shariati, A., Shiadeh, S.

40148656,Recurrent Abdominal Pain in a Child - Evaluation and Management.,"Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is defined as the presence of at least 3 episodes of abdominal pain for 3 mo duration, including both organic and functional etiology. Up to 95% of the causes of RAP are due to functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD). Peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, abdominal tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), parasitic infection, and urinary tract infection (UTI) are prominent organic causes of RAP. The published data from developed countries reported pooled prevalence of FAPD in children is 13.5%, in which irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common sub-type. The evaluation includes history taking regarding pain characteristics, associated symptoms, and the presence of stressors. A detailed history and examination are required to assess for alarm symptoms and signs. The presence of alarm symptoms increases the chances of organic etiology for RAP. Basic work-ups such as complete blood counts, stool and urine examinations, serum albumin, and inflammatory markers may be required to look for chronic organic etiologies. Fecal calprotectin (FCP) is a highly sensitive tool to differentiate IBD from IBS. Ultrasound abdomen (USG) helps in the evaluation of cholelithiasis, biliary obstruction, chronic pancreatitis, malrotation, and bowel thickening. Endoscopies are useful for peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, abdominal tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori infection, etc. Organic causes need specific management. FAPD requires patient counselling and medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, yoga, and percutaneous electrical superficial nerve stimulation are indicated for refractory cases.",Seetharaman J,2025,Indian journal of pediatrics,92,5,526-534,10.1007/s12098-025-05469-y,"Seetharaman, J.

32014597,The efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: Evidence based on 35 randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder that may involve disturbance of the gastrointestinal microbiota. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with IBS.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases up to 1 April, 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with IBS that compared probiotics to placebo or no therapy were eligible for the analysis. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to calculate the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of remaining symptoms after therapy. Continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with the 95% CI. Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.
RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs involving 3,452 patients were included in the analysis. Compared with placebo, patients using probiotics had a lower incidence of persistence of symptoms (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89, P < 0.0001). Also, probiotics exerted a beneficial effect on global symptoms and the abdominal pain score (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.14, P < 0.00001), bloating score (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.03, P = 0.01), and flatulence score (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05, P = 0.01). However, patients treated with probiotics had a higher incidence of any adverse event (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.44).
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with multi-strain probiotics can improve IBS symptoms. Further research is required if probiotics are to be adopted as a treatment for IBS.",Niu HL; Xiao JY,2020,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",75,,116-127,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.01.142,"Niu, H.

37957831,Human intestinal organoids: Modeling gastrointestinal physiology and immunopathology - current applications and limitations.,"Human intestinal organoids are an ideal model system for studying gastrointestinal physiology and immunopathology. Altered physiology and mucosal immune response are hallmarks of numerous intestinal functional and inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), coeliac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and obesity. These conditions impact the normal epithelial functions of the intestine, such as absorption, barrier function, secretion, and host-microbiome communication. They are accompanied by characteristic intestinal symptoms and have significant societal, economic, and healthcare burdens. To develop new treatment options, cutting-edge research is required to investigate their etiology and pathology. Human intestinal organoids derived from patient tissue recapitulate the key physiological and immunopathological aspects of these conditions, providing a promising platform for elucidating disease mechanisms. This review will summarize recent reports on patient-derived human small intestinal and colonic organoids and highlight how these models have been used to study intestinal epithelial functions in the context of inflammation, altered physiology, and immune response. Furthermore, it will elaborate on the various organoid systems in use and the techniques/assays currently available to study epithelial functions. Finally, it will conclude by discussing the limitations and future perspectives of organoid technology.",Flood P; Hanrahan N; Nally K; Melgar S,2024,European journal of immunology,54,2,e2250248,10.1002/eji.202250248,"Flood, P., Hanrahan, N., Nally, K., & Melgar, S.

39998756,Placebo response variability on health-related quality of life outcomes in irritable bowel syndrome: an arm-based network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: The impact of placebo response on health outcomes in various diseases, including IBS, is significant. To better understand the effect of different placebo administration methods on the observed outcomes in IBS studies, this meta-analysis aims to explore research findings on the degree of improvement.
METHODS: The meta-analysis included 45 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 5174 patients with confirmed IBS (excluding those with significant comorbidities). The trials were designed to compare the efficacy of different placebo interventions. The primary outcome was the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), and secondary outcomes included the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (IBS-QoL) and the IBS Symptom Visual Analog Scale (VAS). An arm-based Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to examine the relative effectiveness of the placebo interventions on the outcomes.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that sham moxibustion exhibited the most significant efficacy in reducing IBS-SSS (MD -260.00, 95% CrIs: -288.00 to -232.00). Additionally, sham FMT resulted in significant improvements in IBS-QOL scores (MD 9.23, 95% CrIs - 3.69 to 22.30). Meanwhile, placebo tablet interventions were found to be the most effective in reducing VAS scores (MD 4.71, 95% CrIs, -1.14 to 11.10). Overall, this synthesis provides detailed insights into the effectiveness of placebos in addressing different outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Sham moxibustion appears to provide subjective benefits for patients' IBS symptoms. However, the evidence for its efficacy is less robust compared to other interventions, as assessed by GRADE. Understanding the placebo effect in IBS management is crucial for clinical practice and drug development, particularly in placebo comparisons.

In order to establish effective actions for the prevention of IPV during pregnancy, authorities must be aware of the real burden of IPV. This review aimed to summarize the existing evidence about IPV prevalence during pregnancy worldwide.
METHODS: A review of reviews was carried out. All published systematic reviews and meta-analyses published until October 2020 were identified through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The main outcome was the IPV prevalence during pregnancy.
RESULTS: A total of 12 systematic reviews were included in the review, 5 of them including meta-analysis. The quality of the reviews was variable. Physical IPV during pregnancy showed a wide range (1.6-78%), as did psychological IPV (1.8-67.4%).

36257872,The efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplement in ameliorating irritable bowel syndrome severity: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was found in 11% of the general population worldwide. The current pharmacologic management of IBS was unsatisfactory, and it was accompanied by a number of adverse events. Melatonin was found to play an important role in gastrointestinal smooth muscle motility. Dysregulation of endogenous melatonin secretion has been found in IBS patients. Exogenous melatonin supplement has become one alternative treatment for IBS, but the evidence is inconclusive. The current meta-analysis sought to determine the efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplement in improving IBS severity in IBS patients.
METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplement in ameliorating IBS severity in IBS patients. This meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. The primary target outcomes were changes in IBS severity associated with melatonin or placebo.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis of 4 RCTs and 115 participants revealed that exogenous melatonin supplement was associated with significantly better improvement in overall IBS severity than placebo (k = 4, Hedges' g = 0.746, 95% confidence intervals = 0.401-1.091, p < 0.001). The subgroup without concurrent medication had the same result (p < 0.001). In addition, exogenous melatonin supplement was also associated with significantly better improvement in IBS pain severity (p < 0.001) and quality of life (p = 0.007) than placebo, but not in abdominal distension (p = 0.111) or sleep quality (p = 0.142). Finally, melatonin was associated with similar safety profiles with placebo.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides evidence for the use of exogenous melatonin in IBS patients to ameliorate overall IBS severity, IBS pain severity, and quality of life.

38496183,A Narrative Review on the Viability of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine in Treating Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Constipation (IBS-C).,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits, with global prevalence. The etiology of the disease is likely multifactorial; however, autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction and immune-mediated inflammation may contribute the most to the hallmark symptoms of abdominal pain and altered motility of the gut. Current pharmacological therapies operate to modulate intestinal transit, alter the composition of the gut flora and control pain. Non-pharmacological approaches include dietary changes, increased physical activity, or fecal microbiota transplants. None of these therapies can modulate ANS dysfunction or impact the underlying inflammation that is likely perpetuating the symptoms of IBS. Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) is a clinical approach focused on physical manipulation of the body's soft tissues to correct somatic dysfunctions. OMM can directly target the pathophysiology of IBS through many approaches such as ANS modulation and lymphatic techniques to modify the inflammatory mechanisms within the body. Particular OMM techniques of use are lymphatic manipulation, myofascial release, sympathetic ganglia treatment, sacral rocking, counterstrain, and viscerosomatic treatment. The aim of this study is to identify OMM treatments that can be used to potentially reduce the inflammation and ANS dysfunction associated with IBS symptoms, thereby providing a new non-pharmacological targeted approach for treating the disease.",Basra M; Patel H; Stern-Harbutte A; Lee D; Gregg RK; Waters HB; Potter AK,2024,Cureus,16,2,e54180,10.7759/cureus.54180,"Basra, M., Patel, H., Stern-Harbutte, A., Lee, D., Gregg, R.

In the current review, scientific literature including original research articles, clinical studies, epidemiological reports, and review-type articles concerning human intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the possible consequences on the microbiota were reviewed. Moreover, the following aspects pertaining to COVID-19 have also been discussed: transmission, resistance in the human body, the impact of nutritional status in relation to the intestinal microbiota, and the impact of comorbid metabolic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), obesity, and type two diabetes (T2D). The articles investigated show that health, age, and nutritional status are associated with specific communities of bacterial species in the gut, which could influence the clinical course of COVID-19 infection. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Patients suffering from metabolic and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are thought to be at a moderate-to-high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating the direct implication of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 severity.

38643935,Rome III Criteria Capture Higher Irritable Bowel Syndrome SNP-Heritability and Highlight a Novel Genetic Link With Cardiovascular Traits.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) shows genetic predisposition, and large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are emerging, based on heterogeneous disease definitions. We investigated the genetic architecture of IBS defined according to gold standard Rome Criteria.
METHODS: We conducted GWAS meta-analyses of Rome III IBS and its subtypes in 24,735 IBS cases and 77,149 asymptomatic control subjects from 2 independent European cohorts (UK Biobank and Lifelines). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability (h2SNP) and genetic correlations (rg) with other traits were calculated. IBS risk loci were functionally annotated to identify candidate genes. Sensitivity and conditional analyses were conducted to assess impact of confounders. Polygenic risk scores were computed and tested in independent datasets.
RESULTS: Rome III IBS showed significant SNP-heritability (up to 13%) and similar genetic architecture across subtypes, including those with manifestations at the opposite ends of the symptom spectrum (rg = 0.48 between IBS-D and IBS-C). Genetic correlations with other traits highlighted commonalities with family history of heart disease and hypertension, coronary artery disease, and angina pectoris (rg = 0.20-0.45), among others. Four independent GWAS signals (P < 5×10-8) were detected, including 2 novel loci for IBS (rs2035380) and IBS-mixed (rs2048419) that had been previously associated with hypertension and coronary artery disease. Functional annotation of GWAS risk loci revealed genes implicated in circadian rhythm (BMAL1), intestinal barrier (CLDN23), immunomodulation (MFHAS1), and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway (ADCY2). Polygenic risk scores allowed the identification of individuals at increased risk of IBS (odds ratio, 1.34; P = 1.1×10-3).
CONCLUSIONS: Rome III Criteria capture higher SNP-heritability than previously estimated for IBS.

39944576,Reproductive and sexual health concerns in gastrointestinal illness: a narrative review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), can have a profound and widespread impact on quality of life, including on reproductive and sexual functioning. However, reproductive and sexual concerns are rarely addressed in GI appointments and patients desire more information and guidance related to these important aspects of quality of life. The purpose of this review is to provide a resource for providers seeing GI patients with these issues and to provide suggestions of resources and strategies to address these concerns.
METHODS: We conducted a non-systematic, narrative review of databases including PubMed and Google Scholar to identify English language research on reproductive and fertility concerns and sexual dysfunction (SD) in the setting of GI illness. We applied a biopsychosocial lens to highlight the complex, multifactorial nature of illness experience and quality of life.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: GI illnesses, including IBD and IBS, contribute unique biopsychosocial risk factors to disruptions in reproductive and sexual functioning. GI patients have unique counseling needs that may shift throughout the reproductive lifespan. Research indicates that psychosocial outcomes improve when patients receive education and counseling, yet providers rarely address these topics.
CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary providers working with GI patients should routinely assess for reproductive and sexual concerns, and share accurate education with patients to reduce misinformation, shame, untreated symptoms, and emotional distress. Future research should continue to address these topics, as evidence remains inconclusive in several biopsychosocial domains of GI reproductive and sexual health.",Hacker KS; Bedell A,2025,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,10,,15,10.21037/tgh-24-38,"Hacker, K.

39315667,"Evaluating Equity in Clinical Trial Accessibility: An Analysis of Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Educational Disparities in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Drug Trials.","INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder of gut-brain interaction, imposes a significant economic burden because of its high prevalence and the chronic nature of its symptoms. IBS currently has 7 United States Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Despite efforts to improve diversity in randomized controlled trials' participation, significant disparities remain in various medical fields; yet, these have not been thoroughly examined within the context of IBS. We aimed to investigate the demographic, socioeconomic, educational, and geographic disparities in IBS drug trials.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of phase 3 randomized controlled trials on United States Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of IBS with constipation and IBS with diarrhea in the United States. Data on participant demographics and trial site locations were extracted and analyzed to identify disparities.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 17 studies encompassing 21 trials with 17,428 participants. Approximately 77.3% of participants were female, with a mean age of 45.4 years. Race was reported in 95% of the trials, but only 35% disclosed ethnicity. White participants constituted the majority at 79.3%. Hispanics accounted for only 5.9%. Counties without trial sites had smaller average population sizes compared with trial and trial-adjacent counties. Socioeconomic indicators such as poverty rates, median household income, educational attainment, and broadband internet access were lower in counties without trial sites, with higher average Area Deprivation Index scores indicating greater deprivation.
DISCUSSION: The findings highlight significant disparities in IBS trial participation across race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This raises potential concerns about generalizability of trial outcomes and underscores the need for strategies to enhance inclusivity in clinical research.",Kerbage A; Loesch J; Hamza E; Khan S; Nero N; Simons M; Lembo A,2025,The American journal of gastroenterology,120,4,873-882,10.14309/ajg.0000000000003099,"Kerbage, A., Loesch, J., Hamza, E., Khan, S., Nero, N., Simons, M., & Lembo, A.

39732303,Evaluating MicroRNAs as diagnostic tools for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: Findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Lymph node metastasis (LNM) significantly affects the prognosis and clinical management of breast cancer (BC) patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with LNM in BC and evaluate their potential diagnostic and prognostic value. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases, to assess the role of miRNAs in LNM BC. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. A total of 84 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in BC patients with LNM. Of these, a meta-analysis was performed in two microRNAs that were present in at least 3 different articles with a coherent expression direction: miR-155 and miR-34a. The meta-analysis returned a pooled a Log2 fold change of 1.50 for miR-155 (upregulated) and -0.53 for miR-34a (downregulated) with no evidence of publication bias, and a low risk of bias and applicability concerns. To conclude, this study names miR-155 and miR-34a as potential diagnostic biomarkers for LNM in BC, although further experimental validation is necessary to confirm these findings and develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for clinical use.",Martínez CG; Therapontos S; Lorente JA; Lucena MA; Ortega FG; Serrano MJ,2025,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,207,,104598,10.1016/j.critrevonc.2024.104598,"Martínez, C.

34442713,Bioactive Compounds in Food as a Current Therapeutic Approach to Maintain a Healthy Intestinal Epithelium.,"The intestinal epithelium serves as an effective barrier against the external environment, hampering the passage of potentially harmful substances (such as pathogenic microbes) that could trigger an exacerbated host immune response. The integrity of this barrier is thus essential for the maintenance of proper intestinal homeostasis and efficient protective reactions against chemical and microbial challenges. The principal consequence of intestinal barrier defects is an increase in intestinal permeability, which leads to an increased influx of luminal stressors, such as pathogens, toxins, and allergens, which in turn trigger inflammation and immune response. The fine and fragile balance of intestinal homeostasis can be altered by multiple factors that regulate barrier function, many of which are poorly understood. This review will address the role of gut microbiota as well as food supplements (such as probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics) in modulating gut health and regulating intestinal barrier function. In particular, we will focus on three human pathologies: inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergy.",Salinas E; Reyes-Pavón D; Cortes-Perez NG; Torres-Maravilla E; Bitzer-Quintero OK; Langella P; Bermúdez-Humarán LG,2021,Microorganisms,9,8,,10.3390/microorganisms9081634,"Salinas, E., Reyes-Pavón, D., Cortes-Perez, N.

32577079,Tryptophan Metabolites Along the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: An Interkingdom Communication System Influencing the Gut in Health and Disease.,"The 'microbiota-gut-brain axis' plays a fundamental role in maintaining host homeostasis, and different immune, hormonal, and neuronal signals participate to this interkingdom communication system between eukaryota and prokaryota. The essential aminoacid tryptophan, as a precursor of several molecules acting at the interface between the host and the microbiota, is fundamental in the modulation of this bidirectional communication axis. In the gut, tryptophan undergoes 3 major metabolic pathways, the 5-HT, kynurenine, and AhR ligand pathways, which may be directly or indirectly controlled by the saprophytic flora. The importance of tryptophan metabolites in the modulation of the gastrointestinal tract is suggested by several preclinical and clinical studies; however, a thorough revision of the available literature has not been accomplished yet. Thus, this review attempts to cover the major aspects on the role of tryptophan metabolites in host-microbiota cross-talk underlaying regulation of gut functions in health conditions and during disease states, with particular attention to 2 major gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both characterized by psychiatric disorders. Research in this area opens the possibility to target tryptophan metabolism to ameliorate the knowledge on the pathogenesis of both diseases, as well as to discover new therapeutic strategies based either on conventional pharmacological approaches or on the use of pre- and probiotics to manipulate the microbial flora.",Bosi A; Banfi D; Bistoletti M; Giaroni C; Baj A,2020,International journal of tryptophan research : IJTR,13,,1178646920928984,10.1177/1178646920928984,"Bosi, A., Banfi, D., Bistoletti, M., Giaroni, C., & Baj, A.

33669290,Nanoparticles in the Food Industry and Their Impact on Human Gut Microbiome and Diseases.,"The use of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) has expanded into various industries including food manufacturing, agriculture, cosmetics, and construction. This has allowed NPs access to the human gastrointestinal tract, yet little is known about how they may impact human health. As the gut microbiome continues to be increasingly implicated in various diseases of unknown etiology, researchers have begun studying the potentially toxic effects of these NPs on the gut microbiome. Unfortunately, conflicting results have limited researcher's ability to evaluate the true impact of NPs on the gut microbiome in relation to health. This review focuses on the impact of five inorganic NPs (silver, iron oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and silicon dioxide) on the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal tract with consideration for various methodological differences within the literature. This is important as NP-induced changes to the gut could lead to various gut-related diseases. These include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, and colorectal cancer. Research in this area is necessary as the use of NPs in various industries continues to grow along with the number of people suffering from chronic gastrointestinal diseases.",Ghebretatios M; Schaly S; Prakash S,2021,International journal of molecular sciences,22,4,,10.3390/ijms22041942,"Ghebretatios, M., Schaly, S., & Prakash, S.

METHODS: The search for studies was not restricted to a specific time period but was conducted based on the availability of existing literature within the selected databases. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in four databases: EBSCOhost (from 1995), PubMed (from 1996), Web of Science (from 1964), and Scopus (from 2004), up to November 3, 2021. After applying exclusion criteria, 31 studies published between 1998 and 2021 were selected for final inclusion. The methodological approach included both qualitative and quantitative analyses, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the available evidence.
STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Multidisciplinary interventions including exercise aimed at relieving symptoms of NSCLBP were included. Outcomes analyzed were disability, pain, fear avoidance, quality of life, perceived change, depression, anxiety and stress. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 29 in the meta-analysis. The qualitative analysis showed improvements in favor of the intervention group (IG) in pain, fear avoidance, quality of life and perceived change. The meta-analysis reported significant pooled effect size (ES) in favor of the IGs in disability, pain, fear avoidance, quality of life, and perceived change among patients with NSCLBP.
CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary approaches including exercise appear to be effective in reducing disability, pain, fear avoidance, quality of life and perceived change, but not depression, anxiety or stress in patients with NSCLBP. The findings should be interpreted cautiously in light of substantial heterogeneity and the limited quality of the available evidence.",Vega-Retuerta N; Sánchez-Parente S; Segura-Jiménez V,2025,Preventive medicine,199,,108381,10.1016/j.ypmed.2025.108381,"Vega-Retuerta, N., Sánchez-Parente, S., & Segura-Jiménez, V.

39091658,The role of arousal in maintaining the relationship between insomnia and gastrointestinal conditions.,"The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) conditions and sleep disturbance has been well established. With a higher-than-average prevalence of sleep disturbance in individuals with GI conditions, it is imperative to better understand the maintaining factors driving this comorbidity. Although there are separate, ongoing investigations into both the biological mechanisms and interventions for the sleep and GI relationship, there is a considerable need to further specify common and mutually influential pathways. In our review, we highlight arousal as both a unifying feature of insomnia and various GI conditions as well as a possible mechanism for action for the bidirectional relationship. This review aims to summarize the relationship between arousal, insomnia, and GI conditions, specifically examining sources of arousal across four broad domains: psychosocial factors, physical health factors, daily living factors, and sociocultural factors. Online databases, including PubMed, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar, were searched for full-text English language articles focused on patients with insomnia and/or GI conditions and involving mental health, physical comorbidities, and social factors. Understanding the nature of this bidirectional relationship between sleep and GI through the lens of arousal as a common mechanism will lend itself to using a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and care.",Rameshkumar S; Arizmendi BJ; Salwen-Deremer JK,2024,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,9,,41,10.21037/tgh-23-126,"Rameshkumar, S., Arizmendi, B.

38446808,The Role of Anthocyanins in Alleviating Intestinal Diseases: A Mini Review.,"Anthocyanins are phytonutrients with physiological activity belonging to the flavonoid family whose transport and absorption in the human body follow specific pathways. In the upper gastrointestinal tract, anthocyanins are rarely absorbed intact by active transporters, with most reaching the colon, where bacteria convert them into metabolites. There is mounting evidence that anthocyanins can be used for prevention and treatment of intestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and colorectal cancer (CRC), through the protective function on the intestinal epithelial barrier, immunomodulation, antioxidants, and gut microbiota metabolism. Dietary anthocyanins are summarized in this comprehensive review with respect to their classification and structure as well as their absorption and transport mechanisms within the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, the review delves into the role and mechanism of anthocyanins in treating common intestinal diseases.

38981855,Genetic evidence for the causal impact of insomnia on gastrointestinal diseases and the mediating effects of adiposity traits.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Insomnia has been implicated in gastrointestinal diseases (GIs), but the causal effect between insomnia and GIs and underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
METHODS: By using the released summary-level data, we conducted a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the relationship between insomnia and four GIs and estimate the mediating role of candidate mediators. The first step was to investigate the causal association between insomnia and GIs using univariable MR analysis. The second step was to estimate the mediation proportion of selected mediators in these associations using multivariable MR analysis. Subsequently, results from different datasets were combined using the fixed-effect meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Univariable MR analysis provided strong evidence for the causal effects of insomnia on four GIs after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, including peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% interval confidence [CI] = 1.10-1.20, P = 1.83 × 10-9), gastroesophageal reflux (GORD) (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.16-1.22, P = 5.95 × 10-42), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.15-1.22, P = 8.69 × 10-25), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03-1.05, P = 3.46 × 10-3). In the mediation analysis, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were selected as mediators in the association between insomnia and PUD (BMI: mediation proportion [95% CI]: 13.61% [7.64%-20.70%]; WHR: 8.74% [5.50%-12.44%]) and GORD (BMI: 11.82% [5.94%-18.74%]; WHR: 7.68% [4.73%-11.12%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetically instrumented insomnia has causal effects on PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD, respectively.

39343992,Bridging the Gap: A Comprehensive Study on Traditional Chinese Medicine Strategies for Managing Adult Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Recent studies have witnessed the incorporation of herbal medicine into the management of Disorders of Gut-Brain Interactions (DGBIs), reflecting a paradigm shift toward holistic healing modalities. However, there still exists a substantial gap in comprehending the utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), particularly beyond the confines of China. This study endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap by meticulously identifying existing guidelines, critically reviewing TCM practices, and crafting contemporary treatment recommendations. We systematically searched several databases to retrieve related evidence in June 2023. Firstly, we employed the AGREE II tool to evaluate the recommended for use of TCM in the treatment of IBS, establishing a structured treatment selection hierarchy for different TCM patterns of IBS patients. Subsequently, we conducted an expert questionnaire to gain insights into the common treatment methods and medication choices practiced by clinical TCM doctors. Based on CM theory and experts' opinions, IBS with predominant Diarrheal (IBS-D) is divided into five Chinese medicine syndrome patterns, and IBS with predominant Constipation (IBS-C) is classified to four. A total of 22[Formula: see text]CM prescriptions were recommended for the management of IBS, 13 for IBS-D and 9 for IBS-C. The findings provide IBS patients with enhanced treatment choices while offering clinical physicians more specific treatment regimens.

38439604,Major depressive disorder and the risk of irritable bowel syndrome: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: The association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been found in observational research; however, the causative relationship between MDD and IBS remains uncertain. Using the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we attempted to examine the causal effect of MDD on IBS.
METHODS: Independent genetic variants for MDD identified by Howard et al. based on a genome-wide meta-analysis were selected for this study. Gene-Outcome associations for IBS were gathered from UK Biobank and FinnGen databases. The MR analysis included inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-PRESSO sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: FinnGen database subjected to inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis revealed that MDD may be a risk factor for the development of IBS (OR = 1.356, 95% CI: 1.125-1.632, p = 0.0013). The same finding was reached in UK Biobank for IVW (OR = 1.011, 95% CI: 1.006-1.015, p = 3.18 × 10-7 ), MR-Egger progression (OR = 1.030, 95% CI: 1.008-1.051, p = 0.007), and weighted median (OR = 1.011, 95% CI: 1.005-1.016, p = 0.0001).

40605050,Gut sensory neurons as regulators of neuro-immune-microbial interactions: from molecular mechanisms to precision therapy for IBD/IBS.,"As potentially important biosensors within the intestinal mucosal barrier, gut sensory neurons appear to dynamically orchestrate tissue homeostasis through multimodal integration of mechanical forces, chemical cues, and microbial metabolites. While current research indicates gut sensory neurons may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of IBD/IBS, the precise etiological mechanisms underlying these disorders require further investigation. In the enteric nervous system, intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) show distinct molecular characteristics compared to peripheral sensory neurons originating from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and vagal ganglia (NG/JG, nodose/jugular ganglia). These neuronal subtypes appear to orchestrate bidirectional epithelial-immune communication through context-dependent release of neurochemical signals, potentially establishing a dynamic neuromodulatory network. This comprehensive review will examine the latest findings on the relationship between these sensory neurons and intestinal diseases, and explore an integrated therapeutic framework based on a triple synergistic strategy. This framework could encompass precise molecular-level modulation through targeting neurotransmitters and their receptors, systemic-level neural regulation utilizing electrical nerve stimulation techniques, and ecological reprogramming mediated by gut microbiota. This potential approach may provide a possible translational pathway from mechanistic exploration to practical application, with implications for personalized clinical interventions for IBD/IBS.",Sun N; Cao LS; Xia WY; Wang JM; Wu QF,2025,Journal of neuroinflammation,22,1,172,10.1186/s12974-025-03500-9,"Sun, N., Cao, L.

40657742,The sick gut with diarrhea: FODMAPS for treatment?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine in the light of recent data whether diets low in FODMAPs (a now classic exclusion diet for treatment for IBS: irritable bowel syndrome) have shown interest/efficacy in diseases of the digestive tract (beyond IBS) manifesting as diarrhea.
RECENT FINDINGS: Very little good quality data or publications are available in recent medical literature. It is therefore difficult to estimate that the low FODMAP diet can be considered with a good level of confidence outside of IBS except in borderline symptomatic forms or with associated pathophysiology (e.g. IBD: inflammatory bowel disease).
SUMMARY: There is a lack of quality data on the benefits, safety and value of LFD, outside of IBS. This is particularly the case in the majority of organic digestive diseases, notably with diarrhea, unless accompanied by dysregulation of the intestine-brain axis (and so with IBS symptoms), for example in post-inflammatory situations.

Such a connection may exist also for the remaining non-infectious chronic diarrhoeal conditions, that is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and microscopic colitis (MC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Scopus and PubMed, rendering a total of 710 articles to be screened. All articles were screened independently and assessed for eligibility reporting comorbidity between either IBS or MC, and oral symptoms/disease. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed.
RESULTS: In all, 17 articles were included. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in patients with IBS ranged from 3% to 33% and for IBS in SS between 29% to 62%. Dry mouth, bad breath, and foul taste were overrepresented in these patients. The occurrence of SS in patients with MC ranged from 2% to 9%, and for MC in SS from 1% to 2%.
CONCLUSIONS: An association between SS and IBS and MC, respectively, is plausible. Few articles have explored other oral manifestations. Therefore, no specific conclusions can be drawn. It is pivotal to further explore oral manifestations of these conditions bridging the gap between dental care and general medicine to optimise diagnostics, treatment strategies, and ultimately patient care.",Göthlin H; Hasséus B; Sjöberg K; Bankvall M,2025,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,84,,349-362,10.2340/aos.v84.43870,"Göthlin, H., Hasséus, B., Sjöberg, K., & Bankvall, M.

38743845,Can Hypnotherapy Be Considered a Valuable Component in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease? Insights from a Comprehensive Review.,"Despite advancements in medication,managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains challenging, necessitatingalternative control methods. Gut-directed hypnotherapy, known for alleviating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is debated as an IBD management method. Anextensive search across PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.govuncovered five randomized trials and two case series involving IBD patients undergoing hypnotherapy. A small trial reported statistically significant remission at one year (p = .04), but larger trials, including one with 63 patients, showed no significant gastrointestinal improvements. The first case series noted post-intervention reduction in the mediators of inflammation in rectal mucosal, without long-term monitoring. The second case series observed the absence of flare episodes in 12 of 13 ulcerative colitis patients during follow-up, possibly influenced by the simultaneous use of two drugs alongside hypnotherapy. Psychological outcomes, demonstrated no significant differences between hypnotherapy and control groups. While current literature doesn't decisively support hypnotherapy for managing IBD symptoms, it underscores the importance of further research, including randomized clinical trials, to thoroughly assess its effectiveness in this context.",Mpakogiannis K; Fousekis FS; Katsanos AH; Katsanos KH,2024,The International journal of clinical and experimental hypnosis,72,3,274-288,10.1080/00207144.2024.2350460,"Mpakogiannis, K., Fousekis, F.

This review summarizes recent literature on pediatric MALS while highlighting the challenges, comorbidities, and controversies encountered in this condition.
RECENT FINDINGS: The pathophysiologic mechanism by which MALS leads to pain is currently unknown. Several overlapping conditions are described in MALS, including mental health comorbidities to autonomic disorders such as orthostatic intolerance, POTS, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Comorbid gastrointestinal conditions may include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and gastroparesis. This overlap makes it difficult to distinguish the cause of broad symptoms patients may experience. MALS remains a complex and controversial topic with particular challenges in consensus diagnostic criteria, normative values in children, symptom definition or correlation, patient selection, predictive outcomes, or long-term follow-up data.
SUMMARY: Patients with MALS deserve a comprehensive multidisciplinary team to address their health.

36982816,"Biotherapy Using Probiotics as Therapeutic Agents to Restore the Gut Microbiota to Relieve Gastrointestinal Tract Inflammation, IBD, IBS and Prevent Induction of Cancer.","The gut microbiota is composed of several microbial strains with diverse and variable compositions in both healthy and sick people. An undisturbed gut microbiota needs to be sustained in order to perform all physiological, metabolic, and immune functions in a normal way to prevent the development of diseases. This article has reviewed the published information on the issue of disruption of the balance of the gut microbiota. This disruption could be for many reasons, such as microbial infection in the gastrointestinal tract, food poisoning, diarrhoea, chemotherapy, malnutrition, lifestyle, and ageing. If this disruption is not restored to normal, it might cause dysbiosis. Eventually, a gut microbiota interrupted by dysbiosis might initiate several health issues, such as inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, the induction of cancer, and the progression of a variety of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This review concluded that biotherapy is a natural way of using probiotic products, whether in form of food, beverages, or supplements, to restore the gut microbiota disrupted by dysbiosis. Metabolites secreted by the ingested probiotics help to relieve gastrointestinal tract inflammation and can avoid the induction of cancer.",Dahiya D; Nigam PS,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,6,,10.3390/ijms24065748,"Dahiya, D., & Nigam, P.

40529486,Efficacy and safety of Chinese botanical drug Si Shen Wan in irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), characterized by complex pathogenesis, prolonged disease duration, frequent recurrence, and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Si-Shen-Wan (SSW), a renowned traditional Chinese medicine formula, is widely recognized for its efficacy in managing gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea, and is commonly used to treat diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). This study utilized a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SSW in the treatment of IBS-D.
METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted across seven databases from their inception to 31 October 2024. The analysis included outcomes such as efficacy rate, overall symptom score, abdominal pain score, diarrhea score, abdominal distension score, loss of appetite score, recurrence rate, and adverse events. Meta-analyses were performed using either a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was applied to estimate the sample size and validate the robustness of the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 34 RCTs involving 2,976 participants met the inclusion criteria. The findings demonstrated that SSW alone (RR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.34; P < 0.00001) or combined with biomedicine (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.35; P < 0.00001) significantly improved treatment efficacy compared to biomedicine alone. SSW also reduced the overall symptom score (SMD = -1.06; 95% CI: -1.50, -0.61; Z = 4.66; P < 0.00001) and alleviated key symptoms, including abdominal pain (MD = -0.66; 95% CI: -0.76, -0.56; Z = 12.99; P < 0.00001), diarrhea (MD = -0.69; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.56; Z = 10.82; P < 0.00001), abdominal distension (MD = -0.65; 95% CI: -1.06, -0.24; Z = 3.13; P = 0.002), and loss of appetite (MD = -0.55; 95% CI: -0.66, -0.44; Z = 9.80; P < 0.00001). The recurrence rate was also significantly reduced (RR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.55; P < 0.00001). Additionally, SSW combined with moxibustion-a traditional Chinese medicine therapy integrating internal and external treatments-also further improved treatment outcomes (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37; P = 0.0001). This combination effectively reduced abdominal pain (MD = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.04; Z = 2.17; P = 0.03), diarrhea (MD = -0.41; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.17; Z = 3.41; P = 0.0006), abdominal distension (MD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.69, -0.11; Z = 2.67; P = 0.008), and loss of appetite (MD = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.49, -0.10; Z = 2.93; P = 0.003). Safety analysis revealed a high level of safety for SSW and SSW combined with moxibustion, with no serious adverse events reported in any of the included trials. TSA confirmed an adequate sample size for the primary outcome, supporting the efficacy of SSW in IBS-D treatment.
CONCLUSION: SSW, either used alone or combined with moxibustion, is effective in alleviating IBS-D symptoms and reducing recurrence rates, making it a potentially beneficial intervention. However, certain limitations remain in the overall quality of the current studies, including relatively small sample sizes, insufficiently long follow-up periods, and the absence of a double-blind design. Future research should emphasize the design and implementation of high-quality, long-term, randomized, double-blind clinical trials to further enhance the reliability and external applicability of the research findings.

Yet, the potential benefits and risks associated with vitamin D supplementation still require additional investigation.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IBS using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out utilizing 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) to identify articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals. The odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), along with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), were computed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the appropriate p-value and Cochrane Q and I2 statistics. For the analysis, RevMan 5.3 was utilized.
RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials involving a total of 780 participants were included in this study. Vitamin D supplementation, in adolescents and young adults with IBS, improves the IBS symptoms severity score, QoL and serum 25(OH)D levels compared to controls. We obtained an OR of 2.34 (95% CI: 1.56-3.50) for change in the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), OR = 2.51 (95% CI: 1.71-3.70) for change in QoL, low risk of any adverse events (RR 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35-0.69)), and substantial changes in serum 25(OH)D level (MD = 11.29 (95% CI: 7.13-15.45)). Results were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Rectal bleeding, changes in bowel movements, weight loss, and fatigue are the main clinical presentations of CRC. While the exact etiology of the disease is unknown, CRC is considered a complex and multifactorial disease resulted from an intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, CRC is known as a chronic inflammation-associated tumor, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are susceptible groups to CRC development. The gut microbiota and its metabolites play a crucial role in the development and progression of CRC. CRC can be created after anaerobic bacterial infections such as Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), Fusobacterium, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, etc. Activation of Wnt signaling, loss of tissue architecture, proinflammatory signaling, and genotoxic cellular DNA damage are the primary mechanisms by which anaerobic bacteria induce carcinogenesis in CRC. Besides, spore germination and toxin production are done in hypoxic and acidic conditions.

Gut microbiota-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are increasingly recognized as key players in IBS, with the potential for non-invasive diagnostics and personalized management.
SUMMARY: This review examines VOCs-such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), hydrocarbons, and alcohols-as microbial metabolites influencing IBS through gut barrier function, inflammation, motility, and gut-brain signaling. Cross-sectional studies highlight the diagnostic accuracy of VOCs (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.76-0.99) in distinguishing IBS from healthy controls (HC) and conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), while longitudinal studies underscore their utility in predicting and reflecting microbial changes to microbiota-targeted therapies. Despite this promise, variability in study designs, methodological inconsistencies, and confounding factors hinder clinical translation.

40088964,Enteric nervous system dysfunction as a driver of central nervous system disorders: The Forgotten brain in neurological disease.,"The Enteric Nervous System (ENS), often called the ""second brain,"" is a complex network of neurons and glial cells within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It functions autonomously while maintaining close communication with the central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis (GBA). ENS dysfunction plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Disruptions such as altered neurotransmission, gut microbiota imbalance, and neuroinflammation contribute to disease pathogenesis. The GBA enables bidirectional communication through the vagus nerve, gut hormones, immune signaling, and microbial metabolites, linking gut health to neurological function. ENS dysregulation is implicated in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), influencing systemic and CNS pathology through neuroinflammation and impaired barrier integrity. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ENS dysfunction, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and vagus nerve stimulation, which offer novel ways to modulate gut-brain interactions. Unlike previous perspectives that view the ENS as a passive disease marker, this review repositions it as an active driver of neurological disorders. By integrating advances in ENS biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and GBA modulation, this article presents a paradigm shift-emphasizing ENS dysfunction as a fundamental mechanism in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders.

38568932,Causality of genetically determined blood metabolites on irritable bowel syndrome: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional bowel disorders and dysmetabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of disease. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of information regarding the causal relationship between circulating metabolites and IBS. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the causal relationship between genetically proxied 486 blood metabolites and IBS.
METHODS: A two-sample MR analysis was implemented to assess the causality of blood metabolites on IBS. The study utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to examine 486 metabolites as the exposure variable while employing a GWAS study with 486,601 individuals of European descent as the outcome variable. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used to estimate the causal relationship of metabolites on IBS, while several methods were performed to eliminate the pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Another GWAS data was used for replication and meta-analysis. In addition, reverse MR and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) were employed for additional assessment. Multivariable MR analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the direct impact of metabolites on IBS.
RESULTS: Three known and two unknown metabolites were identified as being associated with the development of IBS. Higher levels of butyryl carnitine (OR(95%CI):1.10(1.02-1.18),p = 0.009) and tetradecanedioate (OR(95%CI):1.13(1.04-1.23),p = 0.003)increased susceptibility of IBS and higher levels of stearate(18:0)(OR(95%CI):0.72(0.58-0.89),p = 0.003) decreased susceptibility of IBS.

39941222,Application of Raman Spectroscopy in Non-Invasive Analysis of the Gut Microbiota and Its Impact on Gastrointestinal Health.,"The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal (GI) health, influencing digestion, metabolism, immune function, and the gut-brain axis. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in microbiota composition, is associated with GI disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer (CRC). Conventional microbiota analysis methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), provide valuable insights but are often expensive, time-consuming, and destructive. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a non-invasive, cost-effective, and highly sensitive alternative. This analytical technique relies on inelastic light scattering to generate molecular ""fingerprints"", enabling real-time, marker-free analysis of microbiota composition and metabolic activity. This review explores the principles, sample preparation techniques, and advancements in RS, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), for microbiota research. RS facilitates identifying microbial species, analysing key metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and monitoring microbiota responses to dietary and therapeutic interventions. The comparative analysis highlights RS's advantages over conventional techniques, such as the minimal sample preparation, real-time capabilities, and non-destructive nature. The integration of RS with machine learning enhances its diagnostic potential, enabling biomarker discovery and personalised treatment strategies for GI disorders. Challenges, including weak Raman signals and spectral complexity, are discussed alongside emerging solutions. As RS technology advances, mainly through portable spectrometers and AI integration, its clinical application in microbiota diagnostics and personalised medicine is poised to transform GI healthcare, bridging microbiota research with practical therapeutic strategies.",Krynicka P; Koulaouzidis G; Skonieczna-Żydecka K; Marlicz W; Koulaouzidis A,2025,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",15,3,,10.3390/diagnostics15030292,"Krynicka, P., Koulaouzidis, G., Skonieczna-Żydecka, K., Marlicz, W., & Koulaouzidis, A.

40418131,[Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in gastrointestinal diseases - a consequence or a cause of progression?].,"The prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is increasing worldwide, especially in countries with high rates of urbanization. The growth of pathogenic and/or opportunistic bacteria in the small intestine can cause clinical symptoms and digestive and absorption disorders. The aim of the review was to analyze available literature on SIBO in various gastrointestinal pathologies. Material and methods. A literature search was conducted for the last 10 years using the library platforms PubMed, Medscape by keywords: ""small intestinal bacterial overgrowth"", ""SIBO"". A total of 1112 scientific papers were found, of which 124 English-language and 28 Russian-language publications were subject to analysis. Of these, 41 articles (including 5 Russian-language ones) corresponding to the topic of this review were included in the review. Results. The article presents data reflecting the pathophysiology and factors contributing to the development of SIBO. It is shown that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a number of organic and functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are closely associated with SIBO. The features of the pathogenesis of SIBO in gastrointestinal diseases (IBS, IBD, functional dyspepsia, celiac disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, chronic pancreatitis, etc.) and its influence on the course of gastrointestinal pathology are described. Conclusion. It is impossible to unambiguously assess the influence that SIBO and various types of gastrointestinal pathology have on each other, since, on the one hand, SIBO can develop as a result of gastrointestinal diseases, and on the other hand, it can serve a predictor of the deterioration of these diseases.

Among the SCFAs, butyrate stands out and has been extensively studied for its beneficial effects; however, propionate has received less attention despite its relevant roles in immune modulation, metabolism, and mucosal homeostasis. This narrative review focuses on propionate's effects on metabolism, inflammation, microbiota, and gastrointestinal diseases. Propionate acts as a signalling molecule through FFAR2/FFAR3 receptors and modulates immunity, energy metabolism, and gut-brain communication. It has beneficial effects in metabolic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). However, excessive accumulation is linked to neurotoxicity, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and mitochondrial dysfunction. Its effects are dose-dependent and tissue-specific, with both protective and harmful potentials depending on the context.

38008696,Microbiota and IBD: Current knowledge and future perspectives.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing-remitting disease with a remarkable increase in incidence worldwide and a substantial disease burden. Although the pathophysiology is not fully elucidated yet an aberrant immune reaction against the intestinal microbiota and the gut microbial dysbiosis have been identified to play a major role. The composition of gut microbiota in IBD patients is distinct from that of healthy individuals, with certain organisms predominating over others. Differences in the microbial dysbiosis have been also observed between Crohn Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). A disruption of the microbiota's balance can lead to inflammation and intestinal damage. Microbiota composition in IBD can be affected both by endogenous (i.e., interaction with the immune system and intestinal epithelial cells) and exogenous (i.e., medications, surgery, diet) factors. The complex interplay between the gut microbiota and IBD is an area of great interest for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing new treatments. The purpose of this review is to summarize the latest evidence on the role of microbiota in IBD pathogenesis and to explore possible future areas of research.",Foppa C; Rizkala T; Repici A; Hassan C; Spinelli A,2024,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,56,6,911-922,10.1016/j.dld.2023.11.015,"Foppa, C., Rizkala, T., Repici, A., Hassan, C., & Spinelli, A.

38599319,"Diet, Food, and Nutritional Exposures and Inflammatory Bowel Disease or Progression of Disease: an Umbrella Review.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), contributes to substantial morbidity. Understanding the intricate interplay between dietary factors and the incidence and progression of IBD is essential for developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. This umbrella review comprehensively synthesizes evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate these complex associations. Dietary factors associated with an increased incidence and/or progression of IBD include a high intake of red and processed meat, other processed foods, and refined sugars, together with a low intake of vegetables, fruits, and fiber. For most other food groups, the results are mixed or indicate no clear associations with IBD, CD, and UC. Some differences seem to exist between UC and CD and their risk factors, with increased intake of dietary fiber being inversely associated with CD incidence but not clearly associated with UC. Dietary fiber may contribute to maintaining the gut epithelial barrier and reduce inflammation, often through interactions with the gut microbiota. This seems to play an important role in inflammatory mechanisms in the gut and in IBD incidence and progression. Diets low in fermentable saccharides and polyols can alleviate symptom burden, but there are concerns regarding their impact on the gut microbiota and their nutritional adequacy. Mediterranean diets, vegetarian diets, and a diet low in grains, sugars, and lactose (specific carbohydrate diet) are also associated with lower incidence and/or progression of IBD. The associations of dietary patterns are mirrored by inflammatory biomarkers. IBD is typically treated pharmaceutically; however, many patients have a suboptimal response to medical treatments. The findings from this umbrella review could provide evidence for nutritional counseling and be a valuable addition to traditional treatment plans for IBD.

35863682,Global Hospitalization Trends for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis in the 21st Century: A Systematic Review With Temporal Analyses.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The evolving epidemiologic patterns of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the world, in conjunction with advances in therapeutic treatments, may influence hospitalization rates of IBD. We performed a systematic review with temporal analysis of hospitalization rates for IBD across the world in the 21st century.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed Medline and Embase for population-based studies reporting hospitalization rates for IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) in the 21st century. Log-linear models were used to calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) with associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects meta-analysis pooled country-level AAPCs. Data were stratified by the epidemiologic stage of a region: compounding prevalence (stage 3) in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania vs acceleration of incidence (stage 2) in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America vs emergence (stage 1) in developing countries.
RESULTS: Hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis of IBD were stable in countries in stage 3 (AAPC, -0.13%; 95% CI, -0.72 to 0.97), CD (AAPC, 0.20%; 95% CI, -1.78 to 2.17), and UC (AAPC, 0.02%; 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.94). In contrast, hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis were increasing in countries in stage 2 for IBD (AAPC, 4.44%; 95% CI, 2.75 to 6.14), CD (AAPC, 8.34%; 95% CI, 4.38 to 12.29), and UC (AAPC, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.29 to 6.52). No population-based studies were available for developing regions in stage 1 (emergence).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization rates for IBD are stabilizing in countries in stage 3, whereas newly industrialized countries in stage 2 have rapidly increasing hospitalization rates, contributing to an increasing burden on global health care systems.",Buie MJ; Quan J; Windsor JW; Coward S; Hansen TM; King JA; Kotze PG; Gearry RB; Ng SC; Mak JWY; Abreu MT; Rubin DT; Bernstein CN; Banerjee R; Yamamoto-Furusho JK; Panaccione R; Seow CH; Ma C; Underwood FE; Ahuja V; Panaccione N; Shaheen AA; Holroyd-Leduc J; Kaplan GG; Balderramo D; Chong VH; Juliao-Baños F; Dutta U; Simadibrata M; Kaibullayeva J; Sun Y; Hilmi I; Raja Ali RA; Paudel MS; Altuwaijri M; Hartono JL; Wei SC; Limsrivilai J; El Ouali S; Vergara BI; Dao VH; Kelly P; Hodges P; Miao Y; Li M,2023,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,21,9,2211-2221,10.1016/j.cgh.2022.06.030,"Buie, M.

37111210,Nutritional Status and Its Detection in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Malnutrition is an important issue in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It is caused by altered digestion and absorption within the small bowel, inadequate food intake, and drug-nutrient interactions in patients. Malnutrition is an essential problem because it is related to an increased risk of infections and poor prognosis in patients. It is known that malnutrition is also related to an increased risk of postsurgery complications in IBD patients. Basic nutritional screening involves anthropometric parameters with body mass index (BMI) and others (fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, muscle strength), medical history concerning weight loss, and biochemical parameters (including the Prognostic Nutritional Index). Besides standard nutritional screening tools, including the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Nutritional Risk Score 2002 (NRS 2002), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), specific nutritional screening tools are used in IBD patients, such as the Saskatchewan Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Nutrition Risk Tool (SaskIBD-NR Tool and IBD-specific Nutritional Screening Tool). There is a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies (including iron, zinc, magnesium) and vitamin deficiencies (including folic acid, vitamin B12 and D) in IBD patients. Therefore, regular evaluation of nutritional status is important in IBD patients because many of them are undernourished. An association between plasma ghrelin and leptin and nutritional status in IBD patients has been observed. According to some authors, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) therapy (infliximab) can improve nutritional status in IBD patients. On the other hand, improvement in nutritional status may increase the response rate to infliximab therapy in CD patients. Optimization of nutritional parameters is necessary to improve results of conservative and surgical treatment and to prevent postoperative complications in patients with IBDs. This review presents basic nutritional screening tools, anthropometric and laboratory parameters, dietary risk factors for IBDs, common nutrient deficiencies, associations between anti-TNFα therapy and nutritional status, selected features regarding the influence of nutritional status, and surgical outcome in IBD patients.",Jabłońska B; Mrowiec S,2023,Nutrients,15,8,,10.3390/nu15081991,"Jabłońska, B., & Mrowiec, S.

37734419,"Pathobionts in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Origins, Underlying Mechanisms, and Implications for Clinical Care.","The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although evidence suggests dysbiosis and loss of beneficial microbial species can exacerbate IBD, many new studies have identified microbes with pathogenic qualities, termed ""pathobionts,"" within the intestines of patients with IBD. The concept of pathobionts initiating or driving the chronicity of IBD has largely focused on the putative aggravating role that adherent invasive Escherichia coli may play in CD. However, recent studies have identified additional bacterial and fungal pathobionts in patients with CD and UC. This review will highlight the characteristics of these pathobionts and their implications for IBD treatment. Beyond exploring the origins of pathobionts, we discuss those associated with specific clinical features and the potential mechanisms involved, such as creeping fat (Clostridium innocuum) and impaired wound healing (Debaryomyces hansenii) in patients with CD as well as the increased fecal proteolytic activity (Bacteroides vulgatus) seen as a biomarker for UC severity. Finally, we examine the potential impact of pathobionts on current IBD therapies, and several new approaches to target pathobionts currently in the early stages of development. Despite recognizing that pathobionts likely contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD, more work is needed to define their modes of action. Determining whether causal relationships exist between pathobionts and specific disease characteristics could pave the way for improved care for patients, particularly for those not responding to current IBD therapies.",Gilliland A; Chan JJ; De Wolfe TJ; Yang H; Vallance BA,2024,Gastroenterology,166,1,44-58,10.1053/j.gastro.2023.09.019,"Gilliland, A., Chan, J.

The reported prevalence of malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients ranges between 20% and 85%. Several factors, including reduced oral food intake, malabsorption, chronic blood and proteins loss, and intestinal bacterial overgrowth, contribute to malnutrition in IBD patients.

31301452,Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Have Similar Burden and Goals for Treatment.,"It is unclear whether ulcerative colitis (UC) is a progressive disease similar to Crohn's disease (CD). Patients with UC often are undertreated because of the possibility of curative colectomy and the perception that the disease burden is lower than that of CD. We discuss findings from studies that aimed to determine whether UC and CD have the same disease burden and should be treated in the same intensive way. We discuss the similarities between CD and UC, including effects on quality of life, long-term complications, strictures, increased risk of cancer, pseudopolyps, functional abnormalities, and anorectal dysfunction. Contrary to the generally accepted idea, surgery cannot cure UC. Postoperative complications, especially pouchitis and fecal incontinence, affect more than one third of patients. CD and UC each pose substantial economic burdens. Monitoring, treatments, and goals of therapy are similar for all inflammatory bowel diseases.

37274062,Study of tumor necrosis factor receptor in the inflammatory bowel disease.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are part of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) and have pathophysiological processes such as bowel necrosis and enteric neurons and enteric glial cells. In addition, the main inflammatory mediator is related to the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). TNF-α is a me-diator of the intestinal inflammatory processes, thus being one of the main cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, however, its levels, when measured, are present in the serum of patients with IBD. In addition, TNF-α plays an important role in promoting inflammation, such as the production of interleukins (IL), for instance IL-1β and IL-6. There are two receptors for TNF as following: The tumor necrosis factor 1 receptor (TNFR1); and the tumor necrosis factor 2 receptor (TNFR2). They are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and their receptors have been detected in IBD and their expression is correlated with disease activity. The soluble TNF form binds to the TNFR1 receptor with, and its activation results in a signaling cascade effects such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. In contrast, the transmembrane TNF form can bind both to TNFR1 and TNFR2. Recent studies have suggested that TNF-α is one of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, since TNF levels are present in the serum of both patients with UC and CD. Intravenous and subcutaneous biologics targeting TNF-α have revolutionized the treatment of IBD, thus becoming the best available agents to induce and maintain IBD remission. The application of antibodies aimed at neutralizing TNF-α in patients with IBD that induce a satisfactory clinical response in up to 60% of patients, and also induced long-term maintenance of disease remission in most patients. It has been suggested that anti-TNF-α agents inactivate the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α by direct neutralization, i.e., resulting in suppression of inflammation. However, anti-TNF-α antibodies perform more complex functions than a simple blockade.",Souza RF; Caetano MAF; Magalhães HIR; Castelucci P,2023,World journal of gastroenterology,29,18,2733-2746,10.3748/wjg.v29.i18.2733,"Souza, R.

36508920,Combination therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: Current evidence and perspectives.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory diseases with a relapsing-remitting course, including Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Combination therapy has been proposed as a strategy to enhance treatment efficacy in IBD. The aim of this study is to summarize current evidence and perspectives on combination therapies in IBD.
METHODS: Electronic databases such as PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched to identify relevant studies.
RESULTS: Current evidence supports that the combination of infliximab and thiopurines is more effective than monotherapy in inducing and maintaining remission in IBD. Data on the combination of other biological agents such as adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and immunosuppressors is lacking or showed conflicting results. Vedolizumab seems a potentially effective maintenance regimen after calcineurin inhibitors-based rescue therapy in acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). Dual Targeted Therapy, which is the combination of two biological agents and/or small molecules, might be a reasonable choice in patients with concomitant IBD and extraintestinal manifestations, or in patients with medical-refractory IBD who lack valid alternatives. Some safety concerns such as adverse events (serious and opportunistic infections) and malignancies (lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer) were raised in combination therapies.

38505875,Dietary therapies for adult and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.,"Diet is an environmental exposure implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary therapy is also a tool for management of these conditions. Nutrition therapy for IBD has been shown to reduce intestinal inflammation, promote healing, and alleviate symptoms, as well as improve patients' nutrition status. Although the mechanisms of action of most nutrition therapies for IBD are not well understood, the diets are theorized to eliminate triggers for gut dysbiosis and mucosal immune dysfunction associated with the typical Western diet. Exclusive enteral nutrition and the Crohn's disease exclusion diet are increasingly being used as the primary treatment modality for the induction of remission and/or maintenance therapy in children, and in some adults, with CD. Several other diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, anti-inflammatory diet for IBD, and diets excluding gluten, FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols), lactose, or other compounds, may be helpful in symptom management in both CD and UC, though evidence for biochemical efficacy is limited. In this review, we discuss the role of diet components in IBD pathogenesis and examine diets currently used in the management of children and adults with IBD. We also address practical, psychosocial, and cultural considerations for dietary therapy across diverse populations.",Deas J; Shah ND; Konijeti GG; Lundin A; Lanser O; Magavi P; Ali S,2024,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,39,3,530-545,10.1002/ncp.11146,"Deas, J., Shah, N.

33555375,"Clinical effects and gut microbiota changes of using probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","PURPOSE: Probiotics have been reported to be beneficial for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the types, number of strains, dosage, and intervention time of probiotics used remain controversial. Furthermore, the changes of gut microbiota in IBD's patients are also intriguing. Thus, this meta-analysis was to explore the clinical effects and gut microbiota changes of using probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.
METHODS: The search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane library from inception to April 2020. Qualified randomized controlled trials were included. IBD's remission rate, disease activity index and recurrence rate were extracted and analyzed. Changes in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD are comprehensively described.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles were included. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can induce/maintain IBD's remission and reduce ulcerative colitis (UC) disease activity index (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02, 1.26, P < 0.05; SMD = 1.00, 95% CI 0.27, 1.73, P < 0.05). In subgroup analyses of IBD remission rate and UC disease activity index, we obtained some statistically significant results in some subgroup (P < 0.05). To some extent, probiotic supplements can increase the number of beneficial bacteria (especially Bifidobacteria) in the intestinal tract of patients with IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the treatment of IBD (especially UC) with pro/pre/synbiotics, and synbiotics are more effective. Probiotic supplements that are based on Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium or more than one strain are more likely to be beneficial for IBD remission. The dose of 1010-1012 CFU/day may be a reference range for using probiotics to relieve IBD.",Zhang XF; Guan XX; Tang YJ; Sun JF; Wang XK; Wang WD; Fan JM,2021,European journal of nutrition,60,5,2855-2875,10.1007/s00394-021-02503-5,"Zhang, X.

36771373,Current Nutritional Therapies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Improving Clinical Remission Rates and Sustainability of Long-Term Dietary Therapies.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) includes a spectrum of chronic immune-mediated intestinal diseases thought to be related to the complex interaction between the host immune system and the intestinal microbiome. Research supports the use of nutritional therapy in IBD; however, it is not routinely used in clinical practice. This literature review seeks to advance the understanding of diet and its effect in IBD with a focus on both Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The contribution of diet to the development and treatment of IBD cannot be overstated. In both pediatric as well as adult IBD, nutritional interventions have been shown to improve clinical symptoms as well as inflammatory burden. The impact of dietary intervention is best exemplified through the use of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) in CD. EEN and clinical research on exclusionary whole food diets-Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED), Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet, and Mediterranean Diet-are discussed within this review. Current clinical literature supports the elimination of detrimental components and the incorporation of low processed whole foods in the diet. Additional prospective and longitudinal dietary studies on sustainable and long-term dietary options, along with a deeper understanding of the mechanism, are needed to further advance the role of nutritional interventions in IBD.",Reznikov EA; Suskind DL,2023,Nutrients,15,3,,10.3390/nu15030668,"Reznikov, E.

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitor [JAKi] and sphingosine-1-phosphate [S1P] receptor modulator treatments for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD].
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to May 30, 2022. Randomized controlled trials [RCTs] of JAKi and S1P receptor modulators in adults with UC or CD were eligible. Clinical, endoscopic, histological, and safety data were pooled and analysed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs [26 UC, nine CD] were included. In UC, JAKi therapy was associated with induction of clinical (risk ratio [RR] 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03-4.92; I2 = 65%) and endoscopic [RR 3.99, 95% CI 2.36-6.75; I2 = 36%] remission compared to placebo. Upadacitinib was associated with histological response [RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.97-3.53]. S1P modulator therapy was associated with induction of clinical [RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.88-3.39; I2 = 1%] and endoscopic [RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.07-5.33; I2 = 0%] remission relative to placebo. Ozanimod was superior to placebo for inducing histological remission in UC [RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.43-3.37; I2 = 0%], while etrasimod was not [RR 2.36, 95% CI 0.71-7.88; I2 = 0%]. In CD, JAKi therapy was superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission [RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.98; I2 = 31%], and endoscopic remission [RR 4.78, 95% CI 1.63-14.06; I2 = 43%] compared to placebo.

34149734,Glucocorticoid Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Mechanisms and Clinical Practice.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). IBD etiopathology is multifactorial and involves alteration of immune cells and chronic activation of the inflammatory cascade against yet unknown environmental factors that trigger the disease. IBD therapy aims at improving the quality of life and reducing the risk of disease-related complications to avoid the need for surgery. There is no specific cure for IBDs, and the focus of therapy is supportive measures and use of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are powerful anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents used to treat many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. GCs remain basic treatment for moderate-to-severe IBD, but their use is limited by several important adverse drug effects. Topical administration of a second-generation of GCs, such as budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), represents a valid alternative to use of older, systemic GCs. Administration of second-generation GCs shows promisingly high topical activity and less systemic toxicity, but maintenance therapy with these new GCs in IBD patients is associated with multiple adverse effects. In this review, we make a comparative analysis of the efficacy of first-generation and second-generation GCs in IBD treatment. Unraveling GC biology at the molecular level to uncouple their clinical benefits from detrimental effects is important. One approach is to consider new GC mediators, such as glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper, which may have similar anti-inflammatory properties, but avoids the side effects of GCs. This in-depth analysis can help to improve the development and the clinical outcomes of GC therapies in IBD.",Bruscoli S; Febo M; Riccardi C; Migliorati G,2021,Frontiers in immunology,12,,691480,10.3389/fimmu.2021.691480,"Bruscoli, S., Febo, M., Riccardi, C., & Migliorati, G.

37042969,Prevalence of Extraintestinal Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multisystem disease impacting various body systems including musculoskeletal, ocular, skin, hepatobiliary, pulmonary, cardiac, and haematological systems. The extraintestinal manifestations of IBD are frequent, common in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and impact the morbidity and mortality of patients.
METHODS: The Embase, Embase classic, and PubMed databases were searched between January 1979 and December 2021. A random effects model was performed to find the pooled prevalence of joint, ocular, and skin extraintestinal manifestations of UC and CD.
RESULTS: Fifty-two studies were included that reported on 352 454 patients. The prevalence of at least 1 joint, ocular, or skin extraintestinal manifestation in all IBD, UC, and CD was 24%, 27%, and 35% respectively. The prevalence between UC and CD were similar for pyoderma gangrenosum and axial joint manifestations. Ocular manifestations were found to be more common in CD than in UC. Peripheral joint manifestations and erythema nodosum were found to be more common in CD than UC.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that reports on the prevalence of at least 1 joint, ocular, or skin extraintestinal manifestation in IBD. Our results are largely consistent with figures and statements quoted in the literature. However, our findings are based on significantly larger cohort sizes. Thus, our results have the potential to better power studies and more accurately counsel patients.",Kilic Y; Kamal S; Jaffar F; Sriranganathan D; Quraishi MN; Segal JP,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,2,230-239,10.1093/ibd/izad061,"Kilic, Y., Kamal, S., Jaffar, F., Sriranganathan, D., Quraishi, M.

34425093,Prevalence of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is well recognized, uncertainties remain about the magnitude of this problem. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing prevalence of PSC in IBD to investigate whether type of IBD, how presence of PSC was defined, sex, disease extent or location, time period, or geographic location influenced prevalence.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Embase Classic were searched (from inception to April 10, 2021) to identify observational studies recruiting ≥50 adult patients with IBD and reporting prevalence of PSC. Data were extracted, and pooled prevalence, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated.
RESULTS: Of 1204 citations, 64 studies were eligible, containing 776,700 patients. Overall, pooled prevalence of PSC in IBD was 2.16%; it was highest in South America and lowest in Southeast Asia. Pooled prevalences in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and IBD-unclassified were 2.47%, 0.96%, and 5.01%, respectively. Pooled prevalence was significantly higher in UC versus CD (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.24-2.29). In subgroup analyses according to method used to define presence of PSC, the highest prevalence was 2.88% in studies performing both liver biochemistry and endoscopic retrograde/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and the lowest was 1.79% in studies using a clinical diagnosis. Prevalence was generally higher in men, patients with more extensive, compared with left-side, UC or ileocolonic or colonic, compared with ileal, CD.

38656784,Intravenous Versus Subcutaneous Infliximab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous [SC] infliximab may provide multiple benefits over intravenous [IV] formulations. However, studies for efficacy and safety in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] have been constrained by small sizes that limit the interpretation of outcomes, particularly for subgroups potentially at high risk of disease relapse.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis up to January 2023, to evaluate the change in clinical remission after transitioning from IV to SC infliximab in patients with IBD in clinical remission. The primary outcome was measured using the relative risk for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 15 studies of patients established ≥ 3 months on IV infliximab, consisting of 1371 patients and 840 patient-years of follow-up. There was no loss of clinical remission in the IBD cohort overall, Crohn's disease [CD], or perianal CD [p = 0.55 and p = 0.11 at 9-12 months, and p = 0.50 at 6 months, respectively]. Neither prior IV dose [≤ 10 mg/kg 6-weekly] [p = 0.48] nor IBD disease subtype was associated with an increased clinical relapse rate at 6 months (p = 0.48 and p = 0.45 [UC vs CD], respectively).
CONCLUSION: Changing patients established on IV infliximab to an SC formulation is associated with a high ongoing clinical remission and a low adverse event rate. Furthermore, there are no signals for adverse outcomes among different IBD disease subtypes, nor in those on escalated IV infliximab dosing schedules up to 10 mg/kg 6-weekly. These data should provide patients and clinicians alike with confidence in SC infliximab use in IBD.",Chetwood JD; Tran Y; Subramanian S; Smith PJ; Iborra M; Buisson A; Paramsothy S; Leong RW,2024,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,18,9,1440-1449,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjae059,"Chetwood, J.

33689803,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Pathogenic Mechanisms and Clinical Translation.,"The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD) are characterised by chronic non-resolving gut mucosal inflammation involving innate and adaptive immune responses. Neutrophils, usually regarded as first responders in inflammation, are a key presence in the gut mucosal inflammatory milieu in IBD. Here, we review the role of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as a potential effector disease mechanism. NETs are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins and oxidative enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain pathogens. NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; and recently, as a major tissue damaging process involved in the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. NETs are pertinent as a defence mechanism at the gut mucosal interphase exposed to high levels of bacteria, viruses and fungi. On the other hand, NETs can also potentiate and perpetuate gut inflammation. In this review, we discuss the broad protective vs. pathogenic roles of NETs, explanatory factors that could lead to an increase in NET formation in IBD and how NETs may contribute to gut inflammation and IBD-related complications. Finally, we summarise therapeutic opportunities to target NETs in IBD.",Drury B; Hardisty G; Gray RD; Ho GT,2021,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,12,1,321-333,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.03.002,"Drury, B., Hardisty, G., Gray, R.

33421515,Selecting End Points for Disease-Modification Trials in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: the SPIRIT Consensus From the IOIBD.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic and disabling disorders. Prospective disease-modification trials to prevent disease progression are eagerly awaited. However, disease progression is not clearly defined. The objective of the Selecting End PoInts foR Disease-ModIfication Trials (SPIRIT) initiative was to achieve international expert consensus on the endpoints to be used in future IBD-disease modification trials.
METHODS: This initiative under the auspices of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) began with a systematic literature search to evaluate the current evidence on the definition of disease progression in IBD. On October 22, 2019, a consensus meeting took place during the United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) Congress in Barcelona, during which predefined proposed statements were discussed in a plenary session and voted on anonymously. Agreement was defined as at least 75% of participants voting for any one statement.
RESULTS: The group agreed that the ultimate therapeutic goal in both CD and UC is to prevent disease impact on patient's life (health-related quality of life, disability, fecal incontinence), midterm complications (encompass bowel damage in CD, IBD-related surgery and hospitalizations, disease extension in UC, extraintestinal manifestations, permanent stoma, short bowel syndrome), and long-term complications (gastrointestinal and extraintestinal dysplasia or cancer, mortality).
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations on which goals to achieve in disease-modification trials for preventing disease progression in patients with IBD are proposed by the SPIRIT consensus. However, these recommendations will require validation in actual clinical studies before implementation in disease-modification trials.",Le Berre C; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2021,Gastroenterology,160,5,1452-1460.e21,10.1053/j.gastro.2020.10.065,"Le Berre, C., & Peyrin-Biroulet, L.

39368456,Oxidative stress-related biomarkers as promising indicators of inflammatory bowel disease activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Oxidative stress is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This meta-analysis aimed to identify and quantify the oxidative stress-related biomarkers in IBD and their associations with disease activity. We systematically searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science databases, identifying 54 studies for inclusion. Comparisons included: (i) active IBD versus healthy controls; (ii) inactive IBD versus healthy controls; (iii) active CD versus inactive CD; and (iv) active UC versus inactive UC. Our analysis revealed a significant accumulation of biomarkers of oxidative damage to biomacromolecules, coupled with reductions in various antioxidants, in both patients with active and inactive IBD compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we identified biomarkers that differentiate between active and inactive CD, including malondialdehyde, Paraoxonase 1, catalase, albumin, transferrin, and total antioxidant capacity. Similarly, levels of Paraoxonase 1, erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, catalase, albumin, transferrin, and free thiols differed between active and inactive UC. Vitamins and carotenoids also emerged as potential disease activity biomarkers for CD and UC, but their intake should be monitored to obtain meaningful results. These findings emphasize the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of IBD and highlight the potential of oxidative stress-related biomarkers as a minimally invasive and additional tool for monitoring the activity of IBD.",Tratenšek A; Locatelli I; Grabnar I; Drobne D; Vovk T,2024,Redox biology,77,,103380,10.1016/j.redox.2024.103380,"Tratenšek, A., Locatelli, I., Grabnar, I., Drobne, D., & Vovk, T.

34739073,Depression and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Bidirectional Two-sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Observational studies have suggested a bidirectional association between depression and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], including Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]. However, it remains unclear whether the observed associations are causal due to the difficulties of determining sequential temporality. We investigated the association between depression and IBD by using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization [MR].
METHODS: Independent genetic variants for depression and IBD were selected as instruments from published genome-wide association studies [GWAS] among individuals of predominantly European ancestry. Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations were retrieved from three separate databases for both depression [Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, FinnGen and UK Biobank] and IBD [the largest GWAS meta-analysis, FinnGen and UK Biobank], respectively. MR analyses included the inverse-variance-weighted method, weighted-median estimator, MR-Egger regression, and sensitivity analyses of Steiger filtering and MR PRESSO. From either direction, analyses were performed per outcome database and were subsequently meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted depression [per log-odds ratio increase] was associated with a higher risk of IBD; odds ratios [95% confidence interval] for IBD, CD and UC were 1.20 [1.05, 1.36], 1.29 [1.07, 1.56] and 1.22 [1.01, 1.47] in a combined sample size of 693 183 [36 507 IBD cases], 212 172 [13 714 CD cases] and 219 686 [15 691 UC cases] individuals, respectively. In contrast, no association was observed between genetically influenced IBD and depression in 534 635 individuals [71 466 depression cases].
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings corroborated a causal association of depression on IBD, which may impact the clinical decision on the management of depression in patients with IBD. Though our results did not support a causal effect of IBD on depression, further investigations are needed to clarify the effect of IBD activity on depression [with different symptomology].",Luo J; Xu Z; Noordam R; van Heemst D; Li-Gao R,2022,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,16,4,633-642,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab191,"Luo, J., Xu, Z., Noordam, R., van Heemst, D., & Li-Gao, R.

37094824,Fecal transplantation for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that is thought to be associated with a complex interplay between the immune system, the GI tract lining, the environment, and the gut microbiome, leading to an abnormal inflammatory response in genetically susceptible individuals. An altered composition of the gut's native microbiota, known as dysbiosis, may have a major role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), two subtypes of IBD. There is growing interest in the correction of this underlying dysbiosis using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and safety profile of FMT for treatment of IBD in adults and children versus autologous FMT, placebo, standard medication, or no intervention.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two clinical trial registries, and the reference sections of published trials through 22 December 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that studied adults and children with UC or CD. Eligible intervention arms used FMT, defined as the delivery of healthy donor stool containing gut microbiota to a recipient's GI tract, to treat UC or CD.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. Our primary outcomes were: 1. induction of clinical remission, 2. maintenance of clinical remission, and 3. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4. any adverse events, 5. endoscopic remission, 6. quality of life, 7. clinical response, 8. endoscopic response, 9. withdrawals, 10. inflammatory markers, and 11. microbiome outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 studies with 550 participants. Three studies were conducted in Australia; two in Canada; and one in each of the following: China, the Czech Republic, France, India, the Netherlands, and the USA. One study was conducted in both Israel and Italy. FMT was administered in the form of capsules or suspensions and delivered by mouth, nasoduodenal tube, enema, or colonoscopy. One study delivered FMT by both oral capsules and colonoscopy. Six studies were at overall low risk of bias, while the others had either unclear or high risk of bias. Ten studies with 468 participants, of which nine studies focused on adults and one focused on children, reported induction of clinical remission in people with UC at longest follow-up (range 6 to 12 weeks) and showed that FMT may increase rates of induction of clinical remission in UC compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.84; low-certainty evidence). Five studies showed that FMT may increase rates of induction of endoscopic remission in UC at longest follow-up (range 8 to 12 weeks); however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide and included a possible null effect (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.29; low-certainty evidence). Nine studies with 417 participants showed that FMT may result in little to no difference in rates of any adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.55; very low-certainty evidence) and improvement in quality of life (mean difference (MD) 15.34, 95% CI -3.84 to 34.52; very low-certainty evidence) when FMT was used to induce remission in UC. Two studies, of which one also contributed data for induction of remission in active UC, assessed maintenance of remission in people with controlled UC at longest follow-up (range 48 to 56 weeks). The evidence was very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of clinical remission (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.26 to 34.42; very low-certainty evidence) and endoscopic remission (RR 3.28, 95% CI 0.73 to 14.74; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was also very uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events, risk of any adverse events, and improvement in quality of life when FMT was used to maintain remission in UC. None of the included studies assessed use of FMT for induction of remission in people with CD. One study with 21 participants reported data on FMT for maintenance of remission in people with CD. The evidence was very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of clinical remission in CD at 24 weeks (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.14; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was also very uncertain about the risk of serious or any adverse events when FMT was used to maintain remission in CD. None of the studies reported data on use of FMT for maintenance of endoscopic remission or improvement in quality of life in people with CD.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: FMT may increase the proportion of people with active UC who achieve clinical and endoscopic remission. The evidence was very uncertain about whether use of FMT in people with active UC impacted the risk of serious adverse events or improvement in quality of life. The evidence was also very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of remission in people with UC, as well as induction and maintenance of remission in people with CD, and no conclusive statements could be made in this regard. Further studies are needed to address the beneficial effects and safety profile of FMT in adults and children with active UC and CD, as well as its potential to promote longer-term maintenance of remission in UC and CD.",Imdad A; Pandit NG; Zaman M; Minkoff NZ; Tanner-Smith EE; Gomez-Duarte OG; Acra S; Nicholson MR,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,4,CD012774,10.1002/14651858.CD012774.pub3,"Imdad, A., Pandit, N.

34757139,Efficacy of Biologic Drugs in Short-Duration Versus Long-Duration Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and an Individual-Patient Data Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Starting biologic treatment early in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be associated with higher efficacy, especially in Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: This was a systematic review and individual-patient data meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of biologics approved for IBD at study inception (October 2015), using Vivli data-sharing platform. The primary outcome was the proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission in patients with short-duration (≤18 months) vs long-duration disease (>18 months) analyzed separately for CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). We used meta-regression to examine the impact of patients' characteristics on the primary outcome.
RESULTS: We included 25 trials, testing infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab (6168 patients with CD and 3227 patients with UC). In CD, remission induction rates were higher in pooled placebo and patients in active arms with short-duration disease of ≤18 months (41.4% [244 of 589]) compared with disease duration of >18 months (29.8% [852 of 2857], meta-analytically estimated odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.64). The primary outcome, proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission, was not different in short-duration disease of ≤18 months (n = 589, odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.15) compared with longer disease duration (n = 2857, odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.72). In UC trials, both the proportional biologic/placebo remission-induction effect and the pooled biologic-placebo effect were stable, regardless of disease duration. Primary outcome results remained unchanged when tested using alternative temporal cutoffs and when modeled for individual patient's covariates, including prior anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: There are higher rates of induction of remission with biologics and with placebo in early CD, resulting in a treatment to placebo effect ratio that is similar across disease durations. No such relationships between disease duration and outcomes was found in UC.

32630805,The Effectiveness of Probiotics in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)-A Critical Review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which affects millions of people worldwide, includes two separate diseases: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although the background (chronic inflammatory state) and some of the symptoms of CD and UC are similar, both diseases differ from each other. It is becoming clear that a combination of many factors, in particular genetic background, host immune response and microbial reduced diversity status are associated with IBD. One potential strategy to prevent/treat IBD is gut modulation by probiotics. Over the last twenty years, many publications have focused on the role of probiotics in the course of IBD. The review discusses the utility of different strains of probiotics, especially Bifidobacterium spp., in all factors potentially involved in the etiology of IBD. The probiotic modulatory properties among different study models (cell lines, animal models of colitis, clinical study) are discussed and probiotic usefulness is assessed in relation to the treatment, prevention, and remission of diseases.",Jakubczyk D; Leszczyńska K; Górska S,2020,Nutrients,12,7,,10.3390/nu12071973,"Jakubczyk, D., Leszczyńska, K., & Górska, S.

37506265,Early Biologic Treatment Decreases Risk of Surgery in Crohn's Disease but not in Ulcerative Colitis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can lead to long-term complications that significantly impact patients' quality of life and healthcare resource utilization. Prior studies have demonstrated improved short-term outcomes to early exposure of biologics in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) but not in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, there are conflicting data on impact of early intervention on longer-term adverse events. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the impact of early biologic treatment on rates of IBD-related surgery.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in April 2022. Studies were included if biologic initiation was compared between patients starting early (<3 years of diagnosis or top-down treatment) vs later (>3 years of diagnosis or step-up treatment). Studies with <1 year of follow-up were excluded. The outcomes were colectomy and CD-related surgery for patients with UC and CD, respectively. Random-effects analyses were conducted to compare rates of IBD surgery between early and late biologic treatment.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Three studies included patients with UC and 15 studies included patients with CD. In patients with CD, early biologic therapy was associated with lower odds of surgery (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.84) compared with late treatment. Conversely, in patients with UC, the odds of colectomy were increased (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-6.30).
CONCLUSIONS: Early biologic treatment is associated with lower rates of surgery in patients with CD. In contrast, early biologic therapy appears to be associated with higher rates of colectomy in patients with UC, which may be confounded by disease severity.",Law CCY; Tkachuk B; Lieto S; Narula N; Walsh S; Colombel JF; Ungaro RC,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,7,1080-1086,10.1093/ibd/izad149,"Law, C.

37977068,Effectiveness and safety of upadacitinib for inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT and real-world observational studies.,"BACKGROUND: Upadacitinib, a novel and selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1, has demonstrated promising efficacy in managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, our primary aim was to comprehensively assess the therapeutic effectiveness and safety profile of upadacitinib in the treatment of patients with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature search across prominent databases, including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, to identify pertinent studies providing insights into the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in IBD. The primary endpoint was the achievement of clinical remission, while secondary endpoints encompassed clinical response, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and the evaluation of adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: In this meta-analysis of nine studies, we categorized results by study type. Clinical remission rates were: RCTs 36 % (95 % CI = 30-42 %), real-world studies 25 % (95 % CI = 1-49 %), retrospective studies 40 % (95 % CI = 24-56 %), cohort studies 55 % (95 % CI = 25-85 %). Clinical response rates were: RCTs 61 % (95 % CI = 55-67 %), real-world studies 42 % (95 % CI = 14-70 %), cohort studies 65 % (95 % CI = 57-73 %). Endoscopic remission rates were: RCTs 19 % (95 % CI = 15-24 %), cohort studies 29 % (95 % CI = 5-52 %). Endoscopic response rates were: RCTs 41 % (95 % CI = 36-47 %), cohort studies 57 % (95 % CI = 31-83 %). Incidence rate for any AEs: IBD 69 % (95 % CI = 63-76 %), UC 65 % (95 % CI = 57-74 %), CD 75 % (95 % CI = 67-82 %).

38665795,Role of diet in prevention versus treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.,"Diet is a modifiable risk factor for disease course and data over the past decade have emerged to indicate its role in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, literature is riddled with misinterpretation of data, often leading to unexpected or conflicting results. The key understanding is that causative factors in disease development do not always proceed to an opportunity to change disease course, once established. Here, we discuss the data on dietary influences in three distinct disease states for CD and UC-predisease, active disease and quiescent disease. We appraise the literature for how our dietary recommendations should be shaped to prevent disease development and if or how that differs for CD and UC induction therapy and maintenance therapy. In UC, principles of healthy eating are likely to play a role in all states of disease. Conversely, data linking dietary factors to CD prevention and treatment are paradoxical with the highest quality evidence for CD treatment being exclusive enteral nutrition, a lactose, gluten and fibre-free diet comprising solely of ultraprocessed food-all dietary factors that are not associated or inversely associated with CD prevention. High-quality evidence from dietary trials is much awaited to expand our understanding and ultimately lead our dietary recommendations for targeted patient populations.",Halmos EP; Godny L; Vanderstappen J; Sarbagili-Shabat C; Svolos V,2024,Frontline gastroenterology,15,3,247-257,10.1136/flgastro-2023-102417,"Halmos, E.

39106167,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in IBD: An overview of systematic reviews and updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Probiotics show promise in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet knowledge gaps persist. We performed an overview of systematic reviews and an updated metanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effect of probiotics on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to September 2023. Primary outcomes were clinical remission and recurrence; secondary outcomes included endoscopic response and remission, and adverse events. We calculated odds ratios (OR) using a random-effects model in R. The quality of systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR-2; the trials' risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Evidence certainty was rated using the GRADE framework.
RESULTS: Out of 2613 results, 67 studies (22 systematic reviews and 45 RCTs) met the eligibility criteria. In the updated meta-analysis, the OR for clinical remission in UC and CD was 2.00 (95% CI 1.28-3.11) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.21-12.50), respectively. The subgroup analysis suggested that combining 5-ASA and probiotics may be beneficial for inducing remission in mild-to-moderate UC (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.29-4.28). Probiotics decreased the odds of recurrence in relapsing pouchitis (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.25) and trended toward reducing clinical recurrence in inactive UC (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.01). No protective effect against recurrence was identified for CD. Multi-strain formulations appear superior in achieving remission and preventing recurrence in UC. The use of probiotics was not associated with better endoscopic outcomes. Adverse events were similar to control. However, the overall certainty of evidence was low.
CONCLUSION: Probiotics, particularly multi-strain formulations, appear efficacious for the induction of clinical remission and the prevention of relapse in UC patients as well as for relapsing pouchitis. Notwithstanding, no significant effect was identified for CD. The favorable safety profile of probiotics was also highlighted.",Estevinho MM; Yuan Y; Rodríguez-Lago I; Sousa-Pimenta M; Dias CC; Barreiro-de Acosta M; Jairath V; Magro F,2024,United European gastroenterology journal,12,7,960-981,10.1002/ueg2.12636,"Estevinho, M.

40006003,Drug Development in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: What Is Next?,"Background/Objectives: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy to maintain remission and improve quality of life. Despite the approval of numerous drugs, IBD continues to present treatment challenges. This review aims to summarize novel therapeutic target agents in phases II and III of development, including sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1P), anti-interleukin-23 (IL-23), and other small molecules and monoclonal antibodies currently under investigation (e.g., anti-TL1A, obefazimod, NX-13, RIPK-inhibitors). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to December 2024 to identify relevant articles published in English over the past three-five years, focusing on phase II/III studies for UC and CD. The search included databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and the ClinicalTrials.gov portal. Results: Clinical trials underline the potential of novel immunomodulators, including anti-TL1A, obefazimod, NX-13, RIPK inhibitors, and anti-IL-23p19 agents, as promising therapeutic options for IBD. Anti-IL23p19 therapies, such as risankizumab and mirikizumab, alongside guselkumab, exemplify this class's growing clinical relevance. While some are already in clinical use, others are nearing approval. Conclusions: Ongoing research into long-term safety and the development of personalized treatment strategies remains pivotal to enhance outcomes.

38980426,Immunity in digestive diseases: new drugs for inflammatory bowel disease treatment-insights from Phase II and III trials.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), continues to challenge treatment paradigms. Advancements in therapeutic options have been have been driven by Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of new drug classes, particularly sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulators and interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitors.
METHODS: This review synthesizes findings from Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials conducted up to early 2024, focusing on the impact of S1P modulators and IL-23 inhibitors on IBD management. Drugs such as ozanimod, etrasimod, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab, and brasikumab were evaluated for their efficacy and safety profiles.
RESULTS: S1P modulators, such as ozanimod and etrasimod, effectively regulate immune cell trafficking to reduce inflammation and several trials highlight their clinical effectiveness in both inducing and maintaining remission in IBD, highlighting its long-term safety and sustained therapeutic effects. Additionally, IL-23 inhibitors including risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab, which disrupt key inflammatory cytokine pathways, have already shown significant effectiveness in inducing and maintaining remission in both CD and UC, with favorable safety profiles across multiple studies, suggesting their potential as critical components in managing IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trials indicate that both S1P modulators and IL-23 inhibitors offer promising therapeutic benefits and maintain strong safety profiles, positioning them as potential cornerstone treatments for IBD. Despite these advancements, further exploration into long-term safety and the development of personalized treatment strategies is essential for maximizing clinical outcomes.",Massironi S; Furfaro F; Bencardino S; Allocca M; Danese S,2024,Journal of gastroenterology,59,9,761-787,10.1007/s00535-024-02130-x,"Massironi, S., Furfaro, F., Bencardino, S., Allocca, M., & Danese, S.

35306551,MEFV Mutations in IBD Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta- analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have suggested that mutations in MEFV, the gene responsible for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), are frequently detected in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We aimed to provide further evidence regarding a potential correlation between MEFV gene mutations and IBD by identifying all relevant studies and analyzing their results.
METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar were used to identify all studies that published until January 2021 and reported MEFV mutation patterns in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and indeterminate colitis (IC) with or without a control group. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used to appraise the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Thirteen observational studies, including 937 patients and 977 controls, were analyzed. MEFV mutation rate in IBD patients was 0.238 (95%CI: 0.209-0.270; I 2 =95%); MEFV mutated alleles were more frequent in IBD patients when compared with controls (p=0.03 for UC, p=0.01 for CD and IC). Subgroup analysis indicated that MEFV mutations were increased in patients with IC when compared with UC and CD (I 2 =91%, p<0.001). Patients with extra-intestinal manifestations and pancolitis had 2.57 (95%CI 1.07-6.14; p=0.03) and 2.02 (95%CI: 1.01-4.04, P=0.049) odds ratios to carry MEFV mutant genotypes, respectively. Exon 10 mutations had the most serious impact. No source of heterogeneity was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: MEFV mutations are common in IBD and are linked with the presence of extra-intestinal manifestations and pancolitis.

36235709,Prevalence of Zinc Deficiency in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Malabsorptive disorders are closely associated with micronutrient deficiencies. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), trace element deficiencies pose a clinical burden from disease onset throughout its course, contributing to morbidity and poor quality of life. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of zinc deficiency in IBD. Literature screening was performed on six electronic databases until 1 May 2022. Two independent investigators assessed the 152 retrieved articles for inclusion criteria, met by only nine, that included 17 prevalence entries for Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 9) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 8). No exclusion criteria were applied to language, deficiency cut-offs, population age, general health status, country, or study setting (cohort or cross-sectional). The prevalence of zinc deficiency in blood was scored positive if due to a single disease, not cumulative factors. Zinc deficiency prevalence across selected studies showed higher values in CD than in UC. Pooled analyses by the IBD subgroup showed a total population of 1677 with CD, for an overall mean zinc deficiency prevalence of 54% and 95% confidence intervals (CI) ranging from 0.51 to 0.56, versus 41% (95%CI 0.38-0.45) in the UC population (n = 806). The overall prevalence at meta-analysis was estimated at 50% (95%CI 0.48-0.52), but with high heterogeneity, I2 = 96%. The funnel plot analysis failed to show any evidence of publication bias. The risk of bias across selected studies was moderate to low. In IBD contexts, one of two patients suffers from zinc deficiency. Mismanagement of micronutrient deficiencies plays a role in inflammation trajectories and related cross-pathways.

RESULTS: Overall, 255 studies were assessed. We identified 25 risk factors for IBD, seven of which were noted in both Eastern and Western populations: family history of Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC], former smoking (CD/UC), smoking (CD), appendicectomy (CD), tonsillectomy (CD), meat and meat products (CD), and vitamin D deficiency (UC). The remaining factors, including urban living, current smoking, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, caesarean section, isotretinoin, total energy, fat, cholesterol, fatty acids and their sub-classifications, eggs, and soft drinks, were associated with an increased risk of IBD in Western or Eastern populations only. We identified 21 protective factors for IBD, among which eight were common in the East and West: farm animals (CD/UC), Helicobacter pylori infection (CD/UC), multiple births (CD), physical activity (CD), history of breastfeeding (CD), pets (UC), current smoking (UC), and coffee intake (UC). Ten factors conferred protection against IBD in Western populations only, whereas eight factors conferred protection against IBD in Eastern populations only.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous environmental and dietary factors influenced the development of IBD in both Western and Eastern populations, whereas certain factors influenced IBD risk differently in these populations.",Zhao M; Feng R; Ben-Horin S; Zhuang X; Tian Z; Li X; Ma R; Mao R; Qiu Y; Chen M,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,3,266-276,10.1111/apt.16703,"Zhao, M., Feng, R., Ben-Horin, S., Zhuang, X., Tian, Z., Li, X., Ma, R., Mao, R., Qiu, Y., & Chen, M.

35998097,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Peripheral Blood DNA Methylation Studies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Over the past decade, the DNA methylome has been increasingly studied in peripheral blood of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients. However, a comprehensive summary and meta-analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte [PBL] DNA methylation studies has thus far not been conducted. Here, we systematically reviewed all available literature up to February 2022 and summarized the observations by means of meta-analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search and critical appraisal of IBD-associated DNA methylation studies in PBL using the biomarker-based cross-sectional studies [BIOCROSS] tool. Subsequently, we performed meta-analyses on the summary statistics obtained from epigenome-wide association studies [EWAS] that included patients with Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC] and/or healthy controls [HC].
RESULTS: Altogether, we included 15 studies for systematic review. Critical appraisal revealed large methodological and outcome heterogeneity between studies. Summary statistics were obtained from four studies based on a cumulative 552 samples [177 CD, 132 UC and 243 HC]. Consistent differential methylation was identified for 256 differentially methylated probes [DMPs; Bonferroni-adjusted p ≤ 0.05] when comparing CD with HC and 103 when comparing UC with HC. Comparing IBD [CD + UC] with HC resulted in 224 DMPs. Importantly, several of the previously identified DMPs, such as VMP1/TMEM49/MIR21 and RPS6KA2, were consistently differentially methylated across all studies.
CONCLUSION: Methodological homogenization of IBD epigenetic studies is needed to allow for easier aggregation and independent validation. Nonetheless, we were able to confirm previous observations. Our results can serve as the basis for future IBD epigenetic biomarker research in PBL.",Joustra V; Hageman IL; Satsangi J; Adams A; Ventham NT; de Jonge WJ; Henneman P; D'Haens GR; Li Yim AYF,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,2,185-198,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac119,"Joustra, V., Hageman, I.

34933995,Latin Americans and US Hispanics show differences in IBD phenotype: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Latin America has experienced a rise in the prevalence and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Differences in IBD phenotype between Hispanics in Latin America and those in the USA have not been described. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of population-based and cohort studies comparing the phenotype of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in Latin Americans and US Hispanics. A systematic search was conducted up to March 2019 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. Inclusion criterion includes studies describing IBD phenotype in Latin Americans or in US Hispanics. Exclusion criterion includes prevalence or incidence studies not describing phenotype. A random effects model was chosen ""a priori"" for analysis of pooled proportions. A total of 46 studies were included from Latin America and 7 studies from the USA. The predominant IBD subtype in Latin America was UC with a more balanced UC:CD ratio noted in Puerto Rico (0.53) and Brazil (0.56). UC-related extensive colitis was more common in US Hispanics (0.64) than in Latin Americans (0.38), p<0.001. CD phenotype was similar between US Hispanics and Latin Americans. UC is the predominant IBD subtype in Latin America, with the exception of Puerto Rico and Brazil which demonstrate a more balanced UC:CD ratio.

35092169,Multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are two autoimmune diseases that seriously affect patients' quality of life. Previous studies have established an association between MS and IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), but the results were inconsistent. The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalences of and the association between MS and IBD.
METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched through November 2020 for studies reporting data on MS among patients with IBD and vice versa. The main outcomes were the proportion of MS in patients with IBD and vice versa, as well as the association (risk ratio [RR]) of IBD in MS and that of MS in IBD.
RESULTS: Based on the analysis of 17 studies, the prevalence of MS in patients with IBD was 0.2% (95% CI 0.1-0.4%), while the prevalence of IBD in patients with MS was 0.6% (95% CI 0.4-0.9%). Patients with MS had a higher prevalence of IBD than controls (RR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.38-1.70, p < 0.00001). There was a similarly high risk of developing CD (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14-1.74, p = 0.001) or UC (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.17-1.71, p = 0.0003) in patients with MS (p for subgroup differences: 0.97). Patients with IBD had a higher prevalence of MS than controls (RR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.06-3.45, p = 0.03).

37106245,Association Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Viral Infections.,"Chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are known as inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD). Patients with inflammatory bowel illnesses are more susceptible to viral infections. In people with IBD, viral infections have emerged as a significant issue. Viral infections are often difficult to identify and have a high morbidity and fatality rate. We reviewed studies on viral infections and IBD, concentrating on Cytomegalovirus (CMV), SARS-CoV-2, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), enteric viruses, and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Also, the effect of IBD on these viral infections is discussed. These data suggest that patients with IBD are more likely to get viral infections.

37385235,Adiponectin Levels in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Adipose tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions. The role of adipokines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been evaluated in the current literature with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate adiponectin levels in IBD patients, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), compared to controls, as well as further subgroup analyses. Hence, assessing the potential role of adiponectin as a surrogate marker.
METHODS: We performed a systematic electronic search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, including observational or interventional studies evaluating serum or plasma adiponectin levels in IBD patients in humans. The primary summary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in serum or plasma adiponectin levels between IBD patients versus controls. Subgroup analyses were conducted involving adiponectin levels in CD and UC compared to controls, as well as CD compared to UC.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were included in our qualitative synthesis and 14 studies in our quantitative synthesis, with a total population sample of 2,085 subjects. No significant MD in serum adiponectin levels was observed between IBD patients versus controls {-1.331 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.135-0.472)}, UC patients versus controls (-0.213 [95% CI: -1.898-1.472]), and CD patients versus controls (-0.851 [95% CI: -2.263-0.561]). Nevertheless, a significant MD was found between UC patients versus CD patients (0.859 [95% CI: 0.097-1.622]).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin levels were not able to differentiate between IBD, UC, and CD patients compared to controls. However, significantly higher serum adiponectin levels were observed in UC compared to CD patients.",Surdea-Blaga T; Ismaiel A; Jaaouani A; Leucuta DC; Elsayed A; Ismaiel M; Ben Ameur I; Al Srouji N; Popa SL; Grad S; Ensar D; Dumitrascu DL,2023,"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",41,6,860-871,10.1159/000531614,"Surdea-Blaga, T., Ismaiel, A., Jaaouani, A., Leucuta, D.

37124368,Vedolizumab subcutaneous formulation maintenance therapy for patients with IBD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The application of vedolizumab (VDZ) subcutaneous (SC) formulation has brought more convenience and hope to patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in the coronavirus disease 2019 context.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate all previous studies that used VDZ SC formulation for maintenance therapy in patients with IBD.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: The search was conducted using the subject and free terms related to 'Vedolizumab', 'Subcutaneous', and 'IBD', in Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and at ClinicalTrials.gov databases between 2008 and 2022. The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. The endpoints included efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.
RESULTS: A total of 60 studies and 2 completed clinical registry trials were retrieved, of which 3 RCTs with high methodological quality, and 3 cohort studies with large heterogeneity were included in the meta-analysis. In the RCT study design, patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) under different conditions after treated with VDZ SC were significantly distinct than those for placebo (PBO) in clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and biochemical remission. In Crohn's disease (CD), the aforementioned parameters were slightly higher than those for PBO, but there was not statistically significant in endoscopic remission and the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-naive patients. The clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and biochemical remission in patients with UC after VDZ SC treatment were similar to those after intravenous (IV) treatment. The risk ratios in patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs after VDZ SC and PBO treatments were 86% and 89% in UC, and 96% and 80% in CD, respectively. Compared with IV, safety was not statistically different. The risk of developing anti-VDZ antibody after VDZ SC treatment was only 20% of that after PBO in patients with UC, but it was 9.38 times in CD.
CONCLUSION: VDZ SC treatment maintained the clinical efficacy of IV induction in patients with IBD without increasing the safety risk, and the efficacy was more pronounced in patients with UC. Immunogenicity might be a potential factor for the decrease in efficacy rate in patients with IBD.

32815163,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii alteration in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: We comprehensively carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous studies to determine the association between intestinal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in human studies.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database was conducted until April 1, 2020. Inclusion criteria were studies involving patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) with abundance of F. prausnitzii. The quality of the studies was assessed by the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: A total of 1669 subjects (427 CD patients, 560 UC patients, and 682 healthy controls) were enrolled from 16 studies. Both CD (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -1.36; 95% CI, -1.74 to -0.98; P < 0.00001) and UC patients (SMD: -0.81; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.42; P < 0.0001) had a lower abundance of F. prausnitzii than the healthy controls. Compared with the IBD remission patients, the IBD active patients had lower levels of F. prausnitzii (SMD: -0.56; 95% CI, -0.91 to -0.21; P = 0.002). In the subgroup analyses, the abundance of F. prausnitzii was reduced in both active CD patients (SMD: -0.78; 95% CI, -1.51 to -0.04; P = 0.04) and active UC patients (SMD:-0.44; 95%CI, -0.81 to -0.07; P = 0.02) when compared with the patients with CD or UC in remission, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A negative association between abundance of F. prausnitzii and IBD activity is observed, but a cut-off level of F. prausnitzii to diagnose and/or to start treating IBD is not determined.",Zhao H; Xu H; Chen S; He J; Zhou Y; Nie Y,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,2,320-328,10.1111/jgh.15222,"Zhao, H., Xu, H., Chen, S., He, J., Zhou, Y., & Nie, Y.

32372471,Systematic review: gastrointestinal infection and incident inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: The initiating events of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are not well-defined, but GI infections are implicated.
AIMS: To define the role of GI infections in risk of incident inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and synthesise the current body of relevant translational data to provide biological context for associations between GI infections and IBD risk.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed electronic databases through February 2020. Clinical studies that provided risk estimates of the association between GI infections and incident IBD were included. Inclusion criteria were broader for translational studies aiming to define mechanisms of GI infections and predisposition to or protection from IBD.
RESULTS: Of the studies identified, 63 met full inclusion criteria. Among studies of clinical gastroenteritis, bacteria-specifically, Salmonella species, Campylobacter species and Clostridioides difficile-demonstrated consistent positive associations with risk of incident IBD. Of viruses, norovirus was associated with increased risk of incident CD. Regarding inverse associations with incident IBD, Helicobacter pylori and helminth infections were associated with a generally consistent reduced risk of IBD. Based on a qualitative analysis of the translational data, putative mechanisms involve multiple microbial and immunologic pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this systematic review, certain enteric pathogens are associated with an increased risk of incident IBD, while others are potentially protective. Prospective studies are required to clarify the clinical implications of these enteric pathogens on the risk and course of IBD, and possible therapeutic or preventative benefit.",Axelrad JE; Cadwell KH; Colombel JF; Shah SC,2020,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,51,12,1222-1232,10.1111/apt.15770,"Axelrad, J.

34466013,Anti-Integrins for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Evidence and Perspectives.,"Leukocyte trafficking to the gastrointestinal tract is recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Integrins are expressed on immune cells and interact with cell adhesion molecules (CAM) to mediate leukocyte trafficking. Blockade of the gut-tropic integrin α4β7 and its subunits has been exploited as a therapeutic target in IBD. Natalizumab (anti-α4) is approved for moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD), but its use is limited due to potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Vedolizumab (anti-α4β7) is approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD. It is the most widely used anti-integrin therapy in IBD and has been shown to be effective in both induction and maintenance therapy, with a favorable safety profile. Several models incorporating clinical, genetic, immune, gut microbial, and vitamin D markers to predict response to vedolizumab in IBD have been developed. Etrolizumab (anti-β7) blocks leukocyte trafficking via α4β7 and cell adhesion via αEβ7 integrins. Large phase 3 clinical trials evaluating efficacy of etrolizumab in the induction and maintenance of patients with IBD are underway. Other investigational anti-integrin therapies include abrilumab (anti-α4β7 IgG2), PN-943 (orally administered and gut-restricted α4β7 antagonist peptide), AJM300 (orally active small molecule inhibitor of α4), and ontamalimab (anti-MAdCAM-1 IgG).",Gubatan J; Keyashian K; Rubin SJS; Wang J; Buckman CA; Sinha S,2021,Clinical and experimental gastroenterology,14,,333-342,10.2147/CEG.S293272,"Gubatan, J., Keyashian, K., Rubin, S.

32973596,Alexithymia and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Given the role of alexithymia-as the inability to identify, differentiate, and express emotions-in chronic and immune-mediated illness, this systematic review analyzed the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), mainly represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed throughout this systematic review of the literature published between 2015 and 2020 in indexed sources from PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Search terms for eligible studies were: ""Inflammatory bowel disease"" AND ""Alexithymia"" [Titles, Abstract, Keywords]. Inclusion criteria were: articles written and published in English from 2015 and up to April 2020, reporting relevant and empirical data on alexithymia and IBD. Results: The initial search identified 34 indexed scientific publications. After screening, we found that five publications met the established scientific inclusion criteria. Overall, the mean value of alexithymia ranged from 39 to 53.2 [Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) score], thus mostly falling in non-clinical range for alexithymia (≤51). Comparisons of alexithymia between patients with UC and CD highlighted that patients with CD showed externally oriented thinking and difficulties identifying feelings to a greater extent. Regarding comparisons with other samples or pathologies, patients with IBD were more alexithymic than healthy controls and less alexithymic than patients with major depressive disorder, but no difference was found when compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Then, regarding correlations with other variables, alexithymia was positively associated with anxiety and depression, as well as with psychopathological symptoms and somatic complaints. Conclusion: This systematic review suggests that patients with IBD cannot be generally considered alexithymic at a clinically relevant extent. However, their greater alexithymic levels and its associations with psychological variables and somatic distress may suggest a reactivity hypothesis, in which living with IBD may progressively lead to impaired emotion recognition over time. Specifically, the relationship between IBD and IBS should be further explored, paying deeper attention to the clinical psychological functioning of CD, as IBD requires more emotional challenges to patients.",Martino G; Caputo A; Schwarz P; Bellone F; Fries W; Quattropani MC; Vicario CM,2020,Frontiers in psychology,11,,1763,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01763,"Martino, G., Caputo, A., Schwarz, P., Bellone, F., Fries, W., Quattropani, M.

METHODS: The search for potential literature was conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase from inception to February 15, 2020. The studies assessing arterial stiffness in IBD were reviewed and included.
RESULTS: Conclusively, 17 eligible trials with a total of 2188 participants were in compliance with the inclusion criteria. Of the included 2188 participants, the cases for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were 558 and 693, respectively. Altogether 10 studies were conducted to evaluate the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CPWV) in overall IBD patients, which was significantly increased with the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI as 0.70 (0.48-0.92, P < .01). The pooled results for CPWV in patients with CD and UC were also faster than that of control groups with MD and 95% CI as 1.09 (0.45-1.72) and 0.57 (0.57-1.24), respectively. The CPWV in CD and UC groups was comparable with a MD of 0.07 (P = .74, 95% CI: -0.32 to 0.45).

AIM: To determine the risk of adverse maternal, placental and obstetric outcomes in IBD METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane library through May 2019 for studies reporting adverse maternal, placental and obstetric outcomes in patients with IBD. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for these outcomes in patients with IBD compared to healthy controls.
RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were included (7917 IBD pregnancies and 3253 healthy control pregnancies). Caesarean delivery was more common in patients with IBD compared to healthy controls (OR 1.79, 95% CI, 1.16-2.77). This remained significant for UC (OR 1.80, 95% CI, 1.21-2.90) but not CD (OR 1.48, 95% CI, 0.94-2.34). Similarly, gestational diabetes occurred more commonly in IBD (OR 2.96, 95% CI, 1.47-5.98). The incidences of placental diseases were 2.0% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.1%) for pre-eclampsia, 3.3% (95% CI, 0%-7.2%) for placental abruption, 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) for placenta previa and 0.3% (95% CI, 0%-0.5%) for chorioamnionitis. Patients with IBD were more likely to experience preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 12.10, 95% CI, 2.15-67.98), but not early pregnancy loss (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.49-5.43). Anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy was not associated with chorioamnionitis (OR 1.12, 95% CI, 0.16-7.67), early pregnancy loss (OR 1.49, 95% CI, 0.83-2.64) or placenta previa (OR 1.58, 95% CI, 0.30-8.47).

32115645,A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Incidence and Prevalence Across Europe.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is often one of the most devastating and debilitating chronic gastrointestinal disorders in children and adolescents. The main objectives here were to systematically review the incidence and prevalence of paediatric IBD across all 51 European states.
METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis based on PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, searches of reference lists, grey literature and websites, covering the period from 1970 to 2018.
RESULTS: Incidence rates for both paediatric Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] were higher in northern Europe than in other European regions. There have been large increases in the incidence of both paediatric CD and UC over the last 50 years, which appear widespread across Europe. The largest increases for CD have been reported from Sweden, Wales, England, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Hungary, and for UC from the Czech Republic, Ireland, Sweden and Hungary. Incidence rates for paediatric CD have increased up to 9 or 10 per 100 000 population in parts of Europe, including Scandinavia, while rates for paediatric UC are often slightly lower than for CD. Prevalence reported for CD ranged from 8.2 per 100 000 to approximately 60 and, for UC, from 8.3 to approximately 30.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of paediatric IBD continues to increase throughout Europe. There is stronger evidence of a north-south than an east-west gradient in incidence across Europe. Further prospective studies are needed, preferably multinational and based on IBD registries, using standardized definitions, methodology and timescales.",Roberts SE; Thorne K; Thapar N; Broekaert I; Benninga MA; Dolinsek J; Mas E; Miele E; Orel R; Pienar C; Ribes-Koninckx C; Thomson M; Tzivinikos C; Morrison-Rees S; John A; Williams JG,2020,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,14,8,1119-1148,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa037,"Roberts, S.

40165211,A systematic review and network meta-analysis of the association between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel diseases.,"OBJECTIVES: Several earlier studies have shown that IBD (including its two subtypes, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)) increases the risk of periodontal disease. This study aimed to evaluate the relevance among periodontitis and IBD subcategories.
METHODS: This study was conducted based on PRISMA guidelines. The Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were searched up to February 2024 using pertinent keywords. Case series, review articles, and animal studies were excluded. The risk of bias in this research was evaluated through the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) criteria. The meta-analysis was conducted using R statistical software.
RESULTS: A total of 9134 patients within 13 studies after the screening process were evaluated. Our study has shown that periodontitis is significantly more prevalent among IBD patients (UC and CD). According to prior meta-analyses, PD morbidity was found to be significantly high among CD patients (OR: 4.30; 95% CI: 3.72-4.98; I2 = 0%). Similarly, UC elevated PD risk (OR: 4.55; 95% CI: 3.76-5.50; I2 = 0%). The risk of periodontitis was not significantly different between CD and UC patients (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.65-1.43; I2 = 34%).
CONCLUSIONS: UC and CD patients were more likely to develop periodontitis, with low heterogeneity between studies, while the prevalence of periodontitis among UC and CD patients was not meaningfully different.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The higher risk of periodontitis in patients with IBD indicates the necessity of screening for periodontitis. Considering the various oral manifestations and poor quality of life associated with IBD, it is important to be aware of the symptoms of periodontitis.",Ayati A; Khodabandelu S; Khaleghi S; Nourmohammadi A; Jafari F; Ahmadianghalehsorkh M; Vatani Z; Bashiri HS; Ahmadi M; Jafari M; Soltaninejad H; Rahmanian M,2025,BMC oral health,25,1,463,10.1186/s12903-025-05830-9,"Ayati, A., Khodabandelu, S., Khaleghi, S., Nourmohammadi, A., Jafari, F., Ahmadianghalehsorkh, M., Vatani, Z., Bashiri, H.

33790618,Metalloproteinases in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing two main disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In both these pathologies, excessive and local immune response against luminal antigens promotes a pathological process leading to various degrees of gut damage. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of neutral proteases with the ability to degrade all components of extracellular matrix. In physiological conditions, MMPs are produced at very low level and generally in the latent form and are involved in the normal tissue turnover. Their function is inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). However, in inflamed tissue of IBD patients, MMPs are produced in excess and/or the activity of TIMPs is not sufficient to block MMPs, thereby making a major contribution to the IBD-related mucosal degradation. In this review, we summarize the available evidence on the expression and role of MMPs in IBD.",Marônek M; Marafini I; Gardlík R; Link R; Troncone E; Monteleone G,2021,Journal of inflammation research,14,,1029-1041,10.2147/JIR.S288280,"Marônek, M., Marafini, I., Gardlík, R., Link, R., Troncone, E., & Monteleone, G.

34298111,Neutrophil extracellular traps in inflammatory bowel diseases: Implications in pathogenesis and therapeutic targets.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among the various immune cells involved in IBD, neutrophils are the first to infiltrate and appear to contribute to the impairment of the epithelial barrier, destruction of tissues by oxidative and proteolytic damage, as well as to the perpetuation of inflammation by the release of cytokines and chemokines associated with pro-inflammatory effects. In addition to basic effector mechanisms, such as phagocytosis and chemotaxis, neutrophils can also form extracellular traps (NETs), which is made up of a mesh-like structure - which contains its chromatin (DNA + histones) together with granules and enzymes, such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophilic elastase (NE) - and that acts as a trap that can result in the death of extracellular pathogens and/or can promote tissue damage. Recent evidence indicates that NETs also play an important and significant role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Previous studies have reported increased levels of NETs in tissue and serum samples from patients with IBD, as well as in experimental colitis. In this review, we discuss current knowledge about the formation of NETs and their role in the pathophysiology of IBD, pointing out potential mechanisms by which NETs promote tissue damage, as well as their involvement in complications associated with IBD. In addition, we propose potential targets for therapy to regulate the production of NETs, making it possible to expand the current spectrum of therapies for IBD.",Dos Santos Ramos A; Viana GCS; de Macedo Brigido M; Almeida JF,2021,Pharmacological research,171,,105779,10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105779,"Dos Santos Ramos, A., Viana, G.

37739718,Systematic review: Sarcopenia in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Low skeletal muscle mass (MM) and deteriorated function (sarcopenia) can be a frequent complication in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
AIM: To conduct a systematic review of the paediatric IBD literature on skeletal muscle function and mass and identify interventions that could affect them.
METHODS: Systematic searches (EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane library central for registered control trials and Web of Science) were conducted using the terms 'lean body mass' (LM), 'fat free mass' (FFM) or 'MM' and 'IBD'.
RESULTS: Fourteenth studies were included, presenting data from 439 Crohn's disease (CD), 139 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 IBD-unclassified participants compared with healthy matched or unmatched groups or reference populations. Six out of 14 studies reported lower LM, whilst 7 studies observed lower MM and FFM in CD patients compared to healthy controls. Research in UC patients reported lower LM in 3 studies, lower MM in 3 studies and lower FFM in 4 studies. Three prospective studies measured the impact of enteral feeding and showed improvement on disease activity and LM or FFM, while one retrospective study did not show any impact on LM.
CONCLUSION: Despite the variety of experimental approaches and methods used to assess sarcopenia, most studies showed reduction in MM, LM and FFM in IBD. Nutritional intervention may have a positive effect on LM and FFM. Future research should focus on standardizing the terminology and methodologies used in assessing body composition and investigating sarcopenia in diseased and matched healthy control cohorts in adequately powered studies with a longitudinal design.",Aljilani B; Tsintzas K; Jacques M; Radford S; Moran GW,2023,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,57,,647-654,10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.08.009,"Aljilani, B., Tsintzas, K., Jacques, M., Radford, S., & Moran, G.

38651771,Meta-analysis: Persistence of advanced therapies in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: The expanding options in advanced therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) present challenges in treatment selection. Persistence analysis assesses drug durability in real-world settings, acting as a surrogate marker for medication efficacy and tolerance. Unlike traditional comparative studies, persistence analysis provides insights extending beyond the initial year of treatment.
AIM: To provide real-world evidence on treatment effectiveness, tolerability and preferences of physicians and patients regarding various advanced therapies for IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of observational studies up to March 2023 assessing advanced therapies' persistence in UC and CD. Advanced therapies under examination included infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, golimumab, certolizumab and tofacitinib. We pooled the persistence of each agent and conducted a meta-analysis to compare the persistence of newer agents with traditional TNF inhibitors (TNFi)-specifically infliximab and adalimumab.
RESULTS: Among 63 observational studies, vedolizumab had the highest 1-year persistence in UC (73.8%, 95% CI: 70.0%-77.6%) and ustekinumab in CD (77.5%, 95% CI: 72.9%-82.1%). Compared to TNFi, vedolizumab demonstrated increased persistence with a relative risk (RR) of 1.30 (95% CI: 1.19-1.41) for UC and 1.14 (95% CI: 1.09-1.20) for CD at 1 year, while ustekinumab demonstrated a RR of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23) for CD at 1 year. Vedolizumab exhibited sustained increased persistence in UC over 2 years compared to TNFi (RR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.14-1.54).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis highlights the superior persistence of ustekinumab and vedolizumab over TNFi, and offers valuable insights for clinicians navigating the challenging landscape of UC and CD therapeutic choices.",Yiu TH; Ko Y; Pudipeddi A; Natale P; Leong RW,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,59,11,1312-1334,10.1111/apt.18006,"Yiu, T.

36827916,"Blood regulatory T cells in inflammatory bowel disease, a systematic review, and meta-analysis.","INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease involving various parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the contradictory results regarding the percentage of peripheral blood (PB) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in IBD patients, this meta-analysis aimed to determine the Tregs frequency in IBD patients.
METHOD: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases for relevant observational articles that analyzed and reported the frequency of PB Tregs in IBD patients and healthy control groups. After choosing the related articles by two reviewers, the data regarding the definition of Tregs and their frequencies in different groups were recorded.
RESULT: In 22 studies, the results showed a nonsignificant difference in the frequency of PB Tregs between IBD cases and control subjects (SMD: -0.27, 95 % CI: -0.78, 0.23). However, the frequency of CD4+CD25+CD127- (SMD: -0.89, 95 % CI: -1.52, -0.26) and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ (SMD: -1.32, 95 % CI: -2.37, -0.26) Tregs were significantly lower in IBD cases, compared to healthy subjects. Also, UC cases and active IBD cases showed a significantly lower frequency of Treg cells, compared to controls and remission IBD cases, respectively (SMD: -0.68, 95 % CI: -1.24, -0.11 and SMD: -0.60, 95 % CI: -0.93, -0.27).

34344314,Systematic review and meta-analysis: real-world data rates of deep remission with anti-TNFα in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Deep remission (DR) is a treatment target in IBD associated with reduced hospitalization and improved outcome. Randomized control trial (RCT) data demonstrates efficacy of anti-TNFα agents in achieving DR; however, real-world data (RWD) can provide information complementary to RCTs, specifically regarding treatment duration. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we use real-world data (RWD) to determine rates of DR in IBD treated with anti-TNFα.
METHODS: We completed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE on July 8, 2019 with review of major gastrointestinal conference abstracts from 2012 to 2019. Studies utilizing RWD (data not from phase I-III RCTs) of adult IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα agents were included. DR was defined by clinical and endoscopic remission at minimum. DR was assessed at 8 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: 29,033 publications were identified. Fifteen publications, nine manuscripts and six conference abstracts, were included encompassing 1212 patients (769 Crohn's disease-CD, 443 ulcerative colitis-UC), and analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. Rate of DR was 36.4% (95% CI 12.6-69.4%) at 8 weeks, 39.1% (95% CI 10.4-78%) at 6 months, 44.4% (95% CI 34.6-54.6%) at 1 year, and 36% (95% CI 18.7-58%) at 2 years. DR in CD at 1 year was 48.6% (95% CI 32.8-64.7%) and in UC was 43.6% (95% CI 32.8-55.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of DR was highest after 1 year of therapy, in nearly 45% of IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα. Similar rates were achieved between patients with UC and CD.

33312730,Inflammatory bowel disease and prostate cancer risk: A systematic review.,"Objective: To evaluate the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), focussing on ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) separately. Methods: A systemic search was carried out using PubMed and Web of Science databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We retrieved a total of 349 articles. All the articles were in the English language and investigated the incidence of PCa in patients with IBD. Results: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 205 037 men. Two studies reported an increase in the risk of PCa in men with IBD in general. Five other studies reported an increased risk of PCa in men with UC or with CD specifically. On the other hand, two studies reported a decreased risk of PCa in patients with UC and patients with IBD treated with aminosalicylates. Conclusions: While men with UC appear to have higher risk of developing PCa, data on patients with CD are inconclusive. Therefore, patients with UC may benefit from earlier PCa screening. Our findings confirm a complex interplay between IBD and PCa, including factors such as genetic predisposition, systemic inflammation and treatment effects. The modulatory effect of treatment strategies for IBD on the development and progression of PCa might be of clinical significance.

34718595,COVID-19 and Outcomes in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Our understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is rapidly evolving. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes in IBD patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Clinicaltrials.gov, Web of Science, MedRxiv, and Google Scholar from inception through October 2020. We included studies with IBD patients and confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected on the prevalence, patient characteristics, pre-infection treatments for IBD, comorbidities, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU), admission, and death.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with 51,643 IBD patients and 1449 with COVID-19 met our inclusion criteria. In 14 studies (n = 50,706) that included IBD patients with and without COVID-19, the prevalence of infection was 1.01% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.10). Of IBD patients with COVID-19, 52.7% had Crohn's disease, 42.2% had ulcerative colitis, and 5.1% had indeterminate colitis. Nine studies (n = 687) reported outcomes according to IBD therapy received. Compared with patients on corticosteroids, those on antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy had a lower risk of hospitalization (risk ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.16-0.35; P < .01; I2 = 0%) and ICU admission (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.37; P < .01) but not death (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.02-1.71; P = .13; I2 = 39%). Compared with patients on mesalamine, those on antitumor necrosis factor therapy had a lower risk of hospitalizations (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.54), ICU admissions (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.58), and death (0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.00). Comparing patients on immunomodulators vs mesalamine or anti-TNF therapy, there was no difference in these outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in IBD patients was low. Use of corticosteroids or mesalamine was significantly associated with worse outcomes, whereas use of anti-TNFs was associated with more favorable outcomes. Further investigation clarifying the mechanisms of these disparate observations could help identify risk and adverse outcome-mitigating strategies for patients with IBD.",Tripathi K; Godoy Brewer G; Thu Nguyen M; Singh Y; Saleh Ismail M; Sauk JS; Parian AM; Limketkai BN,2022,Inflammatory bowel diseases,28,8,1265-1279,10.1093/ibd/izab236,"Tripathi, K., Godoy Brewer, G., Thu Nguyen, M., Singh, Y., Saleh Ismail, M., Sauk, J.

37517000,Risk of uterine cervical cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are limited data on the association between uterine cervical cancer (UCC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the risk of UCC in patients with IBD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, gray literature and conference proceedings for studies published before 21 January 2022. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analyses were based on IBD type, biologic era, immunosuppression status, study location and design, and publication status. Fifteen studies were included.
RESULTS: The pooled relative risk (RR) of UCC in IBD was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.69; I2 = 53.4%). In subgroup analyses, the pooled RRs of UCC in CD and UC were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.97-1.42) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.01-12.21), respectively. The pooled RRs of UCC in pre-biologic and biologic eras were 1.36 (95% CI, 0.83-2.23) and 1.99 (95% CI, 1.03-3.86), respectively. The pooled RR of UCC in immunomodulator users was 2.18 (95% CI, 0.81-5.87). The pooled RRs of UCC in Asia, Europe and North America were 5.65 (95% CI, 2.65-12.07), 1.13 (95% CI, 0.96-1.34) and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.10-1.73), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of UCC was significantly increased in IBD, particularly in UC but not in CD, suggesting that women with IBD should undergo regular UCC screening and consider vaccination.",Kim J; Jung JH; Jo H; Kim MH; Kang DR; Kim HM,2023,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,58,12,1412-1421,10.1080/00365521.2023.2238101,"Kim, J., Jung, J.

39124806,Enthesitis in IBD Patients.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is marked by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompasses two major subtypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is frequently accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), with axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) being the most common. Enthesitis, an inflammation of the bone insertions of capsules, ligaments, and tendons, represents an initial lesion in SpA. However, enthesitis remains an underestimated and often obscured EIM. The early detection of subclinical entheseal involvement in IBD patients using ultrasound (US) could provide an opportunity for timely intervention. US is a more feasible and affordable approach than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While previous meta-analyses have reported on the incidence and prevalence of SpA in IBD, specific attention to enthesitis has been lacking. Therefore, this narrative review aims to assess the current knowledge on existing IBD-SpA cohorts, focusing specifically on enthesitis.",Akrapovic Olic I; Vukovic J; Radic M; Sundov Z,2024,Journal of clinical medicine,13,15,,10.3390/jcm13154540,"Akrapovic Olic, I., Vukovic, J., Radic, M., & Sundov, Z.

32783974,Biological therapy in pediatric age.,"Biological therapies, especially blocking tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) agents have radically changed the therapeutic approach and disease course of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In particular, drugs such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) have been demonstrated to be effective in inducing and maintaining corticosteroid-free remission in both adult and pediatric patients with Crohns Disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). Biosimilar biological (BioS) therapy is increasingly being used in pediatric age even though most knowledge on the safety and efficacy of these agents is based on IFX in adult IBD data. Studies show high rates of clinical response and remission in both IFX naïve patients and in patients switched from originator to BioS with similar risks of adverse events (AEs) as those reported with IFX originator. In the present review indications, efficacy and AEs of biological therapy in pediatric IBD will be discussed, as well as the role of other biological agents such as Golimumab, Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab, the role of BioS biological therapy and utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice.",Penagini F; Cococcioni L; Pozzi E; Dilillo D; Rendo G; Mantegazza C; Zuccotti GV,2020,Pharmacological research,161,,105120,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105120,"Penagini, F., Cococcioni, L., Pozzi, E., Dilillo, D., Rendo, G., Mantegazza, C., & Zuccotti, G.

39185800,Prevalence of Sexual Dysfunction in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may experience symptoms of sexual dysfunction (SD). However, the magnitude of this problem remains uncertain. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of SD in adult patients with IBD.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EMBASE Classic (from inception to April 9, 2024) were searched to identify observational studies reporting the prevalence of SD in adult patients with IBD based on validated screening instruments. Data were extracted, and pooled prevalence (PP), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Of 1017 citations evaluated, 18 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria, containing 2694 patients with IBD recruited from 13 different countries. The PP of SD in IBD patients was 50.6% (95% CI, 40.8%-60.5%; I2 = 96.3%) with an OR = 2.94 (95% CI, 1.99%-4.35%, I2 = 73.4) compared to healthy controls. When we considered ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) separately, the PP of SD was 64.8% (95% CI, 45.1%-82.1%; I2 = 88.8%) in patients with UC and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.0%-79.0%; I2 = 95.3%) in patients with CD. In the subgroup analysis based on sex, the PP of SD was higher in females with IBD than in males (62.7% vs 34.0%; OR = 3.99, 95% CI, 2.80%-5.68%; I2 = 61.7%). Furthermore, the PP of SD was higher in patients with active disease than in patients with inactive disease (75.1% vs 34.2%; OR = 9.65, 95% CI, 1.02%-91.33%, I2 = 95.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated high prevalence of SD in IBD patients, especially in women. Encouraging gastroenterologists to screen for, and treat, these disorders with a holistic approach might improve quality of life of patients with IBD.",Nardone OM; Calabrese G; Bertin L; Ford AC; Castiglione F; Zingone F; Savarino E; Barberio B,2025,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,19,2,,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjae133,"Nardone, O.

32674146,Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], including Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC], are chronic, relapsing and destructive inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract which can lead to organ damage and impair quality of life. A 'treat-to-target' strategy based on activity and severity of disease and response to treatment with close monitoring of intestinal inflammation is recommended. Ileocolonoscopy [CS] is considered the first-line procedure for the assessment of IBD, and magnetic resonance enterography [MRE] is the current standard for assessing the small bowel and complications in CD, and has been proposed as an alternative procedure to CS in the evaluation of both ileo-colonic CD and UC. As that both CS and MRE are invasive and expensive procedures and unappealing to patients, they are unfeasible as frequent and repetitive tools for the monitoring of disease activity. Bowel ultrasound [US] represents a well-tolerated, non-invasive and cost-effective modality to manage IBD patients in clinical practice. Compared to CS and MRE, bowel US has been shown to have the same level of accuracy in assessing and monitoring disease activity and severity of both CD and UC. It can be performed at the point-of-care and therefore allow for real-time clinical decision-making. Point-of-care ultrasound [POCUS] is suggested as the stethoscope of the future and is gaining interest and diffusion in the medical field because it can be used for the bedside examination of patients. The aim of this review is to discuss point-of-care bowel ultrasound [POCBUS] in the management of patients with IBD.",Allocca M; Furfaro F; Fiorino G; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,1,143-151,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa151,"Allocca, M., Furfaro, F., Fiorino, G., Peyrin-Biroulet, L., & Danese, S.

33723700,Effectiveness and Safety of Ustekinumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Ustekinumab, an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 antagonist, is licensed for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) after the phase III trial programs demonstrated efficacy over placebo. However, these findings may not be directly transferable to the real-world due to the stringent inclusion criteria of clinical trials.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the safety and effectiveness of ustekinumab in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A systematic literature search was conducted via Medline and Embase from inception to April 21, 2020. Observational studies assessing ustekinumab's safety and effectiveness by reporting response, remission and/or adverse events (AE) in either CD or UC were included. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias and extracted study data. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to pool rates of clinical response, remission, and safety data.
RESULTS: Following deduplication, 2147 records were identified of which 41 studies (38 CD, 3 UC) comprising 4400 patients were included for quantitative analysis. Pooled clinical remission rates for CD were 34% (95% CI, 26%-42%) following induction and 31% (95% CI, 25%-38%) at one year. For UC, post-induction clinical remission rates were 39% (95% CI, 23%-56%). Serious AEs were reported in 5.6% of patients. Pregnancy outcomes were similar to the general population. One-third of patients with active baseline perianal disease responded or had fistula healing with ustekinumab.
CONCLUSIONS: In the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to date, and the first to include UC, ustekinumab was shown to be effective and safe in the real-world treatment of IBD.",Honap S; Meade S; Ibraheim H; Irving PM; Jones MP; Samaan MA,2022,Digestive diseases and sciences,67,3,1018-1035,10.1007/s10620-021-06932-4,"Honap, S., Meade, S., Ibraheim, H., Irving, P.

33506905,Inflammatory bowel diseases and work disability: a systematic review of predictive factors.,"OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are chronic, relapsing intestinal disorders that may severely compromise patients' labour force participation. In this context, the present review aims to provide an overview on possible IBD pathological, socio-demographic, and treatment-related factors predictive for work disability with the purpose to provide guidance for a successful clinical and occupational management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases was performed to retrieve all the studies addressing IBD-related predictors for work disability.
RESULTS: Several factors have been suggested to predict work disability in the 15 revised investigations, although with not homogeneous results. Having CD was reported as a significantly better predictor for permanent work disability compared to UC, maybe in relation to the generally more serious disease course. Activity and severity of IBD, also indicated by the need for surgical treatment and comorbidities, was related to a significantly greater risk for work disability, although the exact role of other variables, i.e., specific symptoms, disease pattern and inflammatory parameters are still unclear. Among demographic factors, a significant predictive role has been suggested for female gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research seems necessary to confirm the role of IBD related factors on work disability, and on other parameters of work impairment, i.e., absenteeism, presenteeism, activity and productivity loss. Additionally, work disability should be evaluated in relation to specific occupational risk factors. Overall, this may require a multidisciplinary approach aimed to achieve an adequate IBD clinical evaluation and management, an improvement of patients' psychosocial and professional well-being, while appropriately assessing and managing risks in the workplace.",Leso V; Gervetti P; Macrini MC; Russo F; Iavicoli I,2021,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,25,1,165-181,10.26355/eurrev_202101_24382,"Leso, V., Gervetti, P., Macrini, M.

39156916,Association between inflammatory bowel disease and atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a prevalent condition associated with chronic noninfectious inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been hypothesized that chronic inflammation can predispose patients to atrial fibrillation (AF), however, no clear evidence exists to support this.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using major databases aimed at studies focusing on AF development in patients with IBD. Further subgroup analyses were performed for ulcerative colitis (UC) and crohn's disease (CD). Risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model in the Review Manager Software. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Seven studies with 88,893,407 patients were included (1,002,719 and 87, 890, 688 patients in the IBD and non-IBD groups, respectively). IBD patients were at an increased risk of developing AF [RR: 1.52; 95 % CI: 1.19-1.95; p = 0.0009] compared to the non-IBD group. In subgroup analyses, patients with UC were at an increased risk of developing AF [RR: 1.29; 95 % CI: 1.08-1.53; p = 0.004], as were CD patients [RR: 1.30; 95 % CI: 1.07-1.58; p = 0.008] compared to the non-UC and non-CD groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD are at nearly 1.5 times the risk of developing AF compared to the non-IBD population.

37496115,Descriptive Epidemiology of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Oceania: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, idiopathic illnesses of the digestive tract, which can impact adversely on children's quality of life and burden health systems. International studies have shown these diseases are increasing. The aim was to describe pediatric IBD epidemiology across Oceania by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence and prevalence.
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched in October 2022 for studies reporting rates of IBD, Crohn disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) in children (≤19 years). Several data collection methodologies were included and pooled estimates of incidence and prevalence were calculated using a random effects model with I2 measures of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Nineteen articles provided 15 incidence and 7 prevalence studies. Fourteen studies were from Australia, 8 studies from New Zealand, and no studies were found from the Pacific Islands. Study dates ranged from 1950 to 2020 with 11 studies using population-based designs. Pooled estimates for annual incidence were IBD 4.1 (3.4-4.8, I2 = 98.7), CD 2.3 (1.9-2.7, I2 = 98.6), and UC 0.9 (0.6-1.1, I2 = 96.8) per 100,000 person-years. Prevalence rates were IBD 36.0 (23.5-48.5, I2 = 98.4), CD 23.2 (6.6-39.8, I2 = 97.8), and UC 7.6 (2.7-12.5, I2 = 99.6) per 100,000 persons.

32595517,IBD and Bile Acid Absorption: Focus on Pre-clinical and Clinical Observations.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes chronic inflammation affecting the GI tract. It is classified as consisting of Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Bile Acid absorption is altered in both pre-clinical models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IB) and in human IBD. The bile acid transporter apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) showed decreased expression in rats with TNBS colitis. Decreased ASBT expression has also been described in murine, canine and rabbit models of intestinal inflammation. Human IBD studies have shown that an inflamed ileum can interrupt enterohepatic recirculation of bile acid, which could be due to inflammatory cytokine induced repression of the ASBT promoter. There are different hypotheses as to why ASBT is downregulated during CD. In addition, one study has demonstrated the beneficial effect of a glucocorticoid on ASBT expression, when treating IBD. Our aim in this paper was to systematically review various aspects of bile acid malabsorption in animal models of intestinal inflammation, as well as in IBD.",Fitzpatrick LR; Jenabzadeh P,2020,Frontiers in physiology,11,,564,10.3389/fphys.2020.00564,"Fitzpatrick, L.

33084958,"Long-term effects of increasing omega-3, omega-6 and total polyunsaturated fats on inflammatory bowel disease and markers of inflammation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Effects of long-chain omega-3 (LCn3) and omega-6 fatty acids on prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, including Crohn's Disease, CD and ulcerative colitis, UC), and inflammation are unclear. We systematically reviewed long-term effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) on IBD diagnosis, relapse, severity, pharmacotherapy, quality of life and key inflammatory markers.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trials registries, including RCTs in adults with or without IBD comparing higher with lower omega-3, omega-6 and/or total PUFA intake for ≥ 24 weeks that assessed IBD-specific outcomes or inflammatory biomarkers.
RESULTS: We included 83 RCTs (41,751 participants), of which 13 recruited participants with IBD. Increasing LCn3 may reduce risk of IBD relapse (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-1.01) and IBD worsening (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.03), and reduce erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, SMD - 0.23, 95% CI - 0.44 to - 0.01), but may increase IBD diagnosis risk (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.63-1.92), and faecal calprotectin, a specific inflammatory marker for IBD (MD 16.1 μg/g, 95% CI - 37.6 to 69.8, all low-quality evidence). Outcomes for alpha-linolenic acid, omega-6 and total PUFA were sparse, but suggested little or no effect where data were available.
CONCLUSION: This is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of RCTs investigating long-term effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total PUFA on IBD and inflammatory markers. Our findings suggest that supplementation with PUFAs has little or no effect on prevention or treatment of IBD and provides little support for modification of long-term inflammatory status.",Ajabnoor SM; Thorpe G; Abdelhamid A; Hooper L,2021,European journal of nutrition,60,5,2293-2316,10.1007/s00394-020-02413-y,"Ajabnoor, S.

36627691,Systematic review with meta-analysis: Time to diagnosis and the impact of delayed diagnosis on clinical outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: The impact of diagnostic delay on the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains uncertain.
AIM: To perform a systematic review of time to diagnosis and the impact of delayed diagnosis on clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: We searched EMBASE and Medline from inception to 30th November 2022 for studies reporting diagnostic interval, from symptom onset to IBD diagnosis. We calculated the median, interquartile range (IQR) and pooled weighted median, of median diagnostic intervals of eligible studies. We defined delayed diagnosis as individuals above the 75th centile of longest time to diagnosis in each study. Using random effects meta-analysis, we pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for studies reporting clinical outcomes, according to delayed diagnosis.
RESULTS: One hundred and one studies representing 112,194 patients with IBD (CD = 59,359; UC = 52,835) met inclusion criteria. The median of median times to diagnosis was 8.0 (IQR: 5.0-15.2) and 3.7 months (IQR: 2.0-6.7) in CD and UC, respectively. In high-income countries, this was 6.2 (IQR: 5.0-12.3) and 3.2 months (IQR: 2.2-5.3), compared with 11.7 (IQR: 8.3-18.0) and 7.8 months (IQR: 5.2-21.8) in low-middle-income, countries, for CD and UC respectively. The pooled weighted median was 7.0 (95% CI: 3.0-26.4) and 4.6 (95% CI: 1.0-96.0) months, for CD and UC respectively. Eleven studies, representing 6164 patients (CD = 4858; UC = 1306), were included in the meta-analysis that examined the impact of diagnostic delay on clinical outcomes. In CD, delayed diagnosis was associated with higher odds of stricturing (OR = 1.88; CI: 1.35-2.62), penetrating disease (OR = 1.64; CI: 1.21-2.20) and intestinal surgery (OR = 2.24; CI: 1.57-3.19). In UC, delayed diagnosis was associated with higher odds of colectomy (OR = 4.13; CI: 1.04-16.40).
CONCLUSION: Delayed diagnosis is associated with disease progression in CD, and intestinal surgery in both CD and UC. Strategies are needed to achieve earlier diagnosis of IBD.",Jayasooriya N; Baillie S; Blackwell J; Bottle A; Petersen I; Creese H; Saxena S; Pollok RC,2023,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,57,6,635-652,10.1111/apt.17370,"Jayasooriya, N., Baillie, S., Blackwell, J., Bottle, A., Petersen, I., Creese, H., Saxena, S., & Pollok, R.

37692785,Association of serum lipids with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Serum lipid levels seem to be abnormal in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the specific manifestation of abnormal serum lipid levels in IBD are heterogeneous among studies and have not been sufficiently determined yet.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Serum lipid levels were compared between IBD patients and Health individuals, Crohn's (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), active and inactive, mild and non-mild patients, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effect model. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Overall, 53 studies were included. Compared with healthy controls, IBD patients had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.506, 95%CI = -0.674 to -0.338, p < 0.001), HDL-c (WMD = -0.122, 95%CI = -0.205 to -0.039, p = 0.004), and LDL-c (WMD = -0.371, 95%CI = -0.547 to -0.194, p < 0.001) levels. CD groups had a significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.349, 95%CI = -0.528 to -0.170, p < 0.0001) level as compared to UC groups. Active IBD and non-mild UC groups had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.454, 95%CI = -0.722 to -0.187, p = 0.001) (WMD =0.462, 95%CI = 0.176 to 0.748, p = 0.002) and LDL-c (WMD = -0.225, 95%CI = -0.445 to -0.005, p = 0.045) (WMD =0.346, 95%CI = 0.084-0.609, p = 0.010) levels as compared to inactive IBD and mild UC groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The overall level of serum lipids in IBD patients is lower than that of healthy individuals and is negatively associated with disease severity.

36730088,Systematic Review of Diagnostic Delay for Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"OBJECTIVES: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex inflammatory condition of the gut. Diagnosing IBD involves distinct longitudinal periods from first symptoms to primary care assessment, tertiary care referral, and then endoscopic confirmation. The term diagnostic delay (DD) is used if these periods are prolonged. The aim of this review was to amalgamate DD data for children with IBD, and identify factors associated with prolonged DD.
METHODS: Six health literature databases were searched (December 2020). Inclusion criteria for papers were children diagnosed with IBD before the age of 18 years, DD central tendency data, and to report a central tendency of their DD data, cohort >10 children. For analysis, all data were weighted by cohort sample size.
RESULTS: Searches identified 236 papers, and 26 were included in the final analysis with a pooled cohort of 7030 children. The overall DD periods were IBD 4.5 months [Interquartile range (IQR) 3.6-8.7 months], Crohn disease (CD) 5 months (IQR 4-7.2 months), and ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis/IBD-unclassified (UC/IC/IBDU) 3 months (IQR 2.2-4.9 months). The difference between subtypes was significant ( P < 0.001), with shorter DD for UC/IC/IBDU than CD ( P < 0.001) and IBD ( P < 0.001). DD periods were longer for CD than IBD ( P < 0.001). DD decreased over time for IBD ( P < 0.001) and UC ( P < 0.001) but the trend suggested an increase for CD ( P 0.069).
CONCLUSIONS: This data can be used to benchmark DD for children with IBD. Individual centers could determine whether improvements to awareness or infrastructure may reduce DD in order to minimize the risk of poor outcomes.",Vernon-Roberts A; Aluzaite K; Khalilipour B; Day AS,2023,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,76,3,304-312,10.1097/MPG.0000000000003670,"Vernon-Roberts, A., Aluzaite, K., Khalilipour, B., & Day, A.

33370548,Association between periodontal disease and inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the association between periodontal disease (PD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched articles in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and LILACS published until March 2020. Observational studies evaluating the coexistence of PD in IBD and reported values of clinical periodontal parameters, or radiographic bone loss; and IBD diagnosis established by clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological criteria were deemed eligible.
RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included (33,216 individuals). Only one study reported longitudinal data on IBDs onset in patients with PD. Several case-control studies reported coexistence. Meta-analysis showed that the presence of PD was associated with IBD (2.78 [95%CI 1.36-5.69]). PD was strongly associated both with CD (3.41 [95%CI 1.36-8.56]) and UC (3.98 [95%CI 2.02-7.87]).
CONCLUSION: This review presents clear evidence for an association between PD and IBDs. Future studies should avoid non-longitudinal designs and focus on addressing direction. PD screening may be included in the multidisciplinary management of IBD patients. The mere theoretical possibility that PD may predispose to IBDs may be of key significance due to the rising incidence of diseases.",Lorenzo-Pouso AI; Castelo-Baz P; Rodriguez-Zorrilla S; Pérez-Sayáns M; Vega P,2021,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,79,5,344-353,10.1080/00016357.2020.1859132,"Lorenzo-Pouso, A.

38060699,Safety and Efficacy of Biologic Therapies (Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab) in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), that contribute to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, manifesting as bloody diarrhea, fecal urgency, bloating, cramping, and weight loss. IBD manifests as an exacerbation of these symptoms, which medications with high side effect profiles can manage; consequently, many novel therapies, including biologics such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab, have been developed over the years. This systematic review aims to assess the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab and vedolizumab in treating inflammatory bowel disease based on a comprehensive analysis of relevant studies. A thorough literature search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, post hoc analyses, case reports, observational cohorts, and meta-analyses involving ustekinumab and vedolizumab as treatment in IBD patients. The selected studies were critically evaluated for their methodology, patient characteristics, and outcomes. The analysis involved twelve distinct studies investigating the impact of ustekinumab and vedolizumab on individuals afflicted with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The findings revealed a notable trend: ustekinumab displayed a propensity for yielding higher rates of clinical remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Moreover, one study underscored substantial reductions in endoscopic disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who were on ustekinumab. Similarly, ustekinumab exhibited promising outcomes in CD patients, including swift ultrasound responses and the achievement of transmural remission, particularly among those who were new to biologic treatments. In line with this, vedolizumab demonstrated early and considerable symptomatic improvements when used to treat both UC and CD patients. While both biologics showed promising results in inducing and maintaining remission, cautious monitoring is warranted due to the potential adverse events observed in some cases. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the medications' effects on IBD patients.",Ashraf H; Bodapati A; Hanif A; Okafor DK; Katyal G; Kaur G; Khan S,2023,Cureus,15,11,e48338,10.7759/cureus.48338,"Ashraf, H., Bodapati, A., Hanif, A., Okafor, D.

36411558,Modeling Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Intestinal Organoids.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disease caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. IBD encompasses two major clinical entities: ulcerative colitis (UC), limited to the colonic mucosa, and Crohn's disease (CD), which might affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the prevalence of IBD increasing worldwide, therapy remains suboptimal, largely because of the variability of causative mechanisms, raising the need to develop individualized therapeutic approaches targeted to each individual patient. In this context, patients-derived intestinal organoids represent an effective tool for advancing our understanding of IBD's pathogenesis. Organoid 3D culture systems offer a unique model for dissecting epithelial mechanisms involved IBDs and testing individualized therapy, although the lack of a functional immune system and a microbiota, two driving components of the IBD pathogenesis, represent a major barrier to their exploitation in clinical medicine. In this review, we have examined how to improve the translational utility of intestinal organoids in IBD and how co-cultures of 3D or 2D organoids and immune cells and/or intestinal microbiota might help to overcome these limitations.",Di Giorgio C; Roselli R; Biagioli M; Bordoni M; Ricci P; Zampella A; Distrutti E; Donini A; Fiorucci S,2023,Recent advances in inflammation & allergy drug discovery,17,1,39-53,10.2174/2772270817666221121143853,"Di Giorgio, C., Roselli, R., Biagioli, M., Bordoni, M., Ricci, P., Zampella, A., Distrutti, E., Donini, A., & Fiorucci, S.

33778080,The Association between Periodontitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more susceptible to periodontitis. However, data regarding the risk of periodontitis in IBD patients are scarce, and results from individual studies remain controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk of periodontitis in IBD patients.
METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were searched for studies investigating the risk of periodontitis in the IBD patient population from Jan. 2000 to Nov. 2020. Articles were included if they contained the number of people with IBD diagnosed with periodontitis (or periodontal disease parameters) compared with a control group. Case reports, reviews, animal studies, and articles without available abstracts were excluded. A pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the association between periodontitis and IBD.
RESULTS: Six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall risk of periodontitis was significantly higher in IBD patients than controls (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.60-2.74; I 2 = 27%). In particular, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were both linked to an increased risk of periodontitis (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.36-2.19; I 2 = 0% for CD vs. OR:2.39, 95% CI: 1.19-4.80; I 2 = 85% for UC).
CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients are at higher risk of periodontitis than controls. After subgroup analysis, the elevated risk remained significant when analyzing CD or UC alone. UC patients were at higher risk of developing periodontitis than CD patients.",Zhang Y; Qiao D; Chen R; Zhu F; Gong J; Yan F,2021,BioMed research international,2021,,6692420,10.1155/2021/6692420,"Zhang, Y., Qiao, D., Chen, R., Zhu, F., Gong, J., & Yan, F.

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Google Scholar and performed a meta-analysis of 13 studies to analyze how variables such as sample type (stool, biopsy, and lavage) affect results in inflammatory bowel disease gut microbiome studies, using uniform bioinformatic methods for all primary data.
RESULTS: Reduced alpha diversity was a consistent feature of both CD and ulcerative colitis but was more pronounced in CD. Disease contributed significantly variation in beta diversity in most studies, but effect size varied, and the effect of sample type was greater than the effect of disease. Fusobacterium was the genus most consistently associated with CD, but disease-associated genera were mostly inconsistent between studies. Stool studies had lower heterogeneity than biopsy studies, especially for CD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sample type variation is an important contributor to study variability that should be carefully considered during study design, and stool is likely superior to biopsy for CD studies due to its lower heterogeneity.",Abdel-Rahman LIH; Morgan XC,2023,Inflammatory bowel diseases,29,1,125-139,10.1093/ibd/izac194,"Abdel-Rahman, L.

34379220,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Risk of Hospitalization in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease in Population-Based Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) lead to high morbidity and unplanned healthcare utilization. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to estimate the cumulative incidence of IBD-related (and all-cause) hospitalization in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: Through a systematic review to September 3, 2019, we identified population-based inception cohort studies in patients with IBD that reported patient-level cumulative incidence of hospitalization at 1, 3 and 5 years after diagnosis. Hospitalization risk was pooled using random effects meta-analysis, and risk factors analyzed through mixed-effects meta-regression and qualitative synthesis.
RESULTS: In patients with UC (6 cohorts), 1-, 3- and 5-year risk of UC-related hospitalization was 10.4% (95% CI 8.2-13.2), 17.0% (95% CI 14.0-20.4) and 21.5% (95% CI 18.0-25.4), respectively, with considerable heterogeneity. In patients with CD (6 cohorts), 1-, 3- and 5-year risk of CD-related hospitalization was 29.3% (95% CI 20.0-40.8), 38.5% (95% CI 26.8-51.7) and 44.3% (95% CI 32.7-56.5), respectively, with considerable heterogeneity. On meta-regression, steady decline in risk of hospitalization was observed in patients diagnosed in a more contemporary era. Younger age at onset (both UC and CD), extensive colitis (UC), ileal-dominant CD, perianal CD and penetrating and/or stricturing behavior (CD) and early need for corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy (both UC and CD) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization.

METHODS: A total of 44 articles were retrieved from bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, SpingerLink, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. Through a comprehensive filtering procedure, 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were collected in the meta-analysis, which was done by Review Manager 5.0.
RESULTS: After a systematic filtration, there were 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 44 articles involved in our meta-analysis. Our results demonstrated that 3 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with CD/UC/IBD: IRF5 rs4728142 (UC: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.09-1.35, P = 0.0003; OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.57, P = 0.006 in Asian), PTGER4 rs4613763 (CD: the overall OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.64, P = 0.04; IBD: OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.04-1.65, P = 0.02), IL12B rs6887695 (CD: the overall OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.06-1.30, P = 0.002; UC: the overall OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01-1.26, P = 0.03; IBD: the overall OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24, P = 0.0009).

32653651,Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Non-biological treatment.,"Nowadays, non-biological treatments remain valuable approaches among the therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mesalamine is the core treatment of mild‐to‐moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and corticosteroids are crucial for the induction of remission of moderate‐to‐severe flares in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD). Even approaches as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, methotrexate, and surgery still have a nuclear position as strategies to induce and/or maintain remission in IBD. Due to their particularities and to the accumulated evidence, each of these strategies conquered peculiar roles in the overall IBD strategy, all of them contributing to better outcomes. This review emphasizes the particular roles that non-biological treatments gained over time: recent mesalamine formulations to increase adhesion rates, higher doses of 5-ASA for high-risk patients, MMX technology to improve drug release and attain higher bowel concentrations, cyclosporine as a bridge to vedolizumab, tacrolimus as a potential alternative to thiopurines or infliximab, azathioprine in combination therapy with infliximab and dubious in monotherapy, and surgery as a mean to a ""better end"".",Magro F; Cordeiro G; Dias AM; Estevinho MM,2020,Pharmacological research,160,,105075,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105075,"Magro, F., Cordeiro, G., Dias, A.

39530131,An evaluation of risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.,"INTRODUCTION: Risankizumab (RZB) is a recombinant IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody which selectively inhibits interleukin (IL)-23 though high-affinity binding of the p19 subunit. RZB was approved for use in Crohn's disease (CD) in 2022 and received regulatory approval for ulcerative colitis (UC) in the United States in June 2024.
AREAS COVERED: We will examine currently available therapies for UC, provide an overview of the IL-23 pathway, discuss available trial data for RZB in UC, and comment on how RZB may fit into the current UC treatment paradigm and future directions in the field.
EXPERT OPINION: RZB appears to be an effective agent for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with both treatment-naïve and refractory UC, with a favorable safety profile. The selective blockade of IL-23 has demonstrated potential advantages in efficacy over combined IL-12/23 inhibition for other disease states like CD and psoriasis, although where it will be positioned amidst other clinically available advanced therapies in UC requires further study.",Johnson AM; Loftus EV,2024,Expert opinion on biological therapy,24,12,1317-1327,10.1080/14712598.2024.2428311,"Johnson, A.

37116651,The association of antibiotic exposure with new-onset inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The role of antibiotics in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains controversial, primarily due to conflicting data from individual studies. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the effect of antibiotic exposure on IBD development.
METHODOLOGY: The MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were queried from their inception to April 2021 for published articles studying the association between antibiotic exposure and new-onset IBD. Our analysis was stratified by timing of antibiotic exposure - exposure in childhood and any lifetime exposure. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: 10 case-control studies and 2 cohort studies (N = 29,880 IBD patients and N = 715,548 controls) were included. Patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), compared with controls, were associated significantly with antibiotic exposure in childhood and any lifetime exposure to antibiotics (OR 1.52 [1.23-1.87]; p<0.00001). Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), compared with controls, reported non-significant association with antibiotic exposure in childhood and any lifetime exposure. (OR 1.11 [0.93-1.33]; p = 0.25) CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that exposure to antibiotics significantly increases the odds of developing CD and IBD. These findings re-emphasize the importance of cautious and judicious use of antibiotics.",Dar SH; Maniya MT; Merza N; Musheer A; Zahid M; Ahmed F; Shurjeel Q; Qazi S; Ahmed A; Shah H; Zafar A; Iqbal AZ; Khan SF; Rizwan T; Ligresti R,2023,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,47,6,102129,10.1016/j.clinre.2023.102129,"Dar, S.

37108339,Intestinal Microbiota and miRNA in IBD: A Narrative Review about Discoveries and Perspectives for the Future.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and comprises a chronic gastrointestinal tract disorder characterized by hyperactive and dysregulated immune responses to environmental factors, including gut microbiota and dietary components. An imbalance of the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development and/or worsening of the inflammatory process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with various physiological processes, such as cell development and proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer. In addition, they play an important role in inflammatory processes, acting in the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. Differences in the profiles of miRNAs may represent a useful tool in the diagnosis of UC and CD and as a prognostic marker in both diseases. The relationship between miRNAs and the intestinal microbiota is not completely elucidated, but recently this topic has gained prominence and has become the target of several studies that demonstrate the role of miRNAs in the modulation of the intestinal microbiota and induction of dysbiosis; the microbiota, in turn, can regulate the expression of miRNAs and, consequently, alter the intestinal homeostasis. Therefore, this review aims to describe the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and miRNAs in IBD, recent discoveries, and perspectives for the future.",Oliveira ECS; Quaglio AEV; Magro DO; Di Stasi LC; Sassaki LY,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,8,,10.3390/ijms24087176,"Oliveira, E.

30994521,Fecal Lactoferrin for Assessment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Persistent disease activity is associated with a poor prognosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Therefore, monitoring of IBD activity can avoid the poor prognosis. Serum biomarkers reflect a summation of systemic host responses rather than being specific for intestinal inflammation. And endoscopic monitoring is invasive, costly, and time consuming. The objective of our study was to perform a meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of fecal lactoferrin (FL) in assessing IBD activity.
METHODS: We systematically searched the databases from inception to May 2018 that evaluated IBD activity. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. The extracted data were pooled using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve model. Random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.
RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 773 IBD patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for assessing ulcerative colitis (UC) activity were 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.92] and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.61-0.93), respectively. And the pooled sensitivity and specificity values for assessing Crohn's disease (CD) activity were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.63-0.78), respectively. The diagnostic performance of the FL assay in the UC patients appeared to be superior to that in the CD patients.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis has found that FL is an inexpensive, simple, stable, and useful screening marker with high sensitivity and modest specificity for assessing IBD activity, appearing to have greater ability to evaluate UC rather than CD.",Dai C; Jiang M; Sun MJ; Cao Q,2020,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,54,6,545-553,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001212,"Dai, C., Jiang, M., Sun, M.

The common symptoms of UC and CD include inflammation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding, and weight loss. IBD is generally caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental or microbial factors that influence the body's immune response and is responsible for digestive disorders and inflammation of the intestinal tract. However, a complete understanding of the pathophysiology and work-up of IBD is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment for the management of this complex disease.

32076497,Emerging treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation, a relapsing and remitting clinical course, requirement for lifelong medication and often, significant morbidity. While multiple effective therapeutic options exist for the treatment of IBD, a proportion of patients will either fail to respond or lose response to therapy. Advances in therapeutics, such as the gut-specific anti-integrins, now offer patients an alternative option to systemic immunosuppression. Anti-interleukin 12 (anti-IL-12)/IL-23 agents offer new and effective treatment options for CD, while the oral small molecules now offer an oral alternative for the treatment of moderate-to-severe disease, previously requiring subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Alternatives to pharmacological treatment such as stem-cell transplant and faecal microbiota transplant are also showing some promise in the treatment of both CD and UC.",Hazel K; O'Connor A,2020,Therapeutic advances in chronic disease,11,,2040622319899297,10.1177/2040622319899297,"Hazel, K., & O'Connor, A.

36820570,Inflammatory bowel disease and associated cardiovascular disease outcomes: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited and conflicting data available regarding the cardiovascular disease outcomes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
OBJECTIVE: We aim to perform a systematic review to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes and mortality associated with IBD patients.
METHODS: A systematic literature search has been performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus from inception till May 2022 without any language restrictions.
RESULTS: A total of 2,029,941 patients were included in the analysis from 16 studies. The mean age of the patients was 45.6 years. More females were found compared with males (57% vs 43%). The most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) included smoking (24.19%) and alcohol (4.60%). The most common comorbidities includes hypertension (30%), diabetes mellitus (14.41%), dyslipidemia (18.42%), previous CVD (22%), and renal disease (10%). Among outcomes, all-cause mortality among IBD patients was 1.66%; ulcerative colitis (UC): 15.92%; and Crohn disease (CD): 0.30%. Myocardial Infarction (MI) among IBD patients were 1.47%, UC: 30.96%; and CD: 34.14%. CVD events among IBD patients were 1.95%. Heart failure events among IBD patients were 5.49%, stroke events among IBD patients were 0.95%, UC: 2.63%, and CD: 2.41%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: IBD patients are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, especially in women. Although there remains a lack of concrete treatment algorithms and assessment parameters that better characterize IBD risk factors, nutritional modifications and physical activity should be at the forefront of CVD prevention in IBD.",Jaiswal V; Batra N; Dagar M; Butey S; Huang H; Chia JE; Naz S; Endurance EO; Raj N; Patel S; Maroo D; Ang SP; Hanif M; Mukherjee D; Sarfraz Z; Shrestha AB; Song D,2023,Medicine,102,6,e32775,10.1097/MD.0000000000032775,"Jaiswal, V., Batra, N., Dagar, M., Butey, S., Huang, H., Chia, J.

35371788,Ulcerative Colitis-Induced Colorectal Carcinoma: A Deleterious Concatenation.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal ailment that encompasses Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory condition of the colonic mucosa that begins in the rectum and progresses proximally in a continuous way over a portion of the entire colon. Chronic inflammation is linked to cancer, and IBD-related chronic colonic inflammation raises the risk of colorectal cancer. Chronic inflammation has been linked to cancer, and chronic colonic inflammation caused by IBD increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). When CRC arises in people with IBD, unlike sporadic CRC, the lesions are difficult to identify due to mucosal alterations produced by inflammation. The total prevalence of IBD-associated CRC is increasing due to the rapidly increasing frequency of IBD. Screening and surveillance colonoscopy in IBD patients is considered to allow for the early diagnosis of dysplasia and cancer, improving the prognosis of IBD-related CRC by giving patients proactive therapy. This article has reviewed literature pertaining to the mechanisms related to CRC development in UC and its clinical and therapeutic implications.",Rivera AP; Flores Monar GV; Islam H; Puttagunta SM; Islam R; Kundu S; Jha SB; Sange I,2022,Cureus,14,2,e22636,10.7759/cureus.22636,"Rivera, A.

34628128,Association between IL-10 rs3024505 and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the small intestine, colon, and rectum. We evaluated associations between the interleukin 10 (IL-10) rs3024505 polymorphism and IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) by meta-analysis. All peer-reviewed manuscripts concerning the relationship between IL-10_rs3024505 and IBD identified by searing the PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Chinese Medical Database were examined. The association between IL-10_rs3024505 and IBD was evaluated in allele (AG), recessive (RG), dominant (DG), homozygous (HMG), and heterozygous (HTG) genetic models. Associations were also conducted on IBD subtypes, CD and UC, and ethnicity (Non-Europeans and Europeans) subgroups. The meta-analysis included 13 studies, 8552 cases (IBD patients), and 12,830 healthy controls. Subgroup analysis of IBD (UC and CD) revealed heterogeneity in AG, DG, and HTG but no heterogeneity in RG or HMG. Moreover, AG, DG, and HTG did not show publication bias in IBD, CD, or UC, but RG and HMG exhibited publication bias. No heterogeneity and no publication bias were found among the five genetic models by a subgroup analysis of Non-Europeans and European ethnicities. The minor allele(T) of rs3024505 was significantly related to IBD: 1.37 (1.30-1.45) for AG, 2.06 (1.74-2.45) for RG, 1.39 (1.27-1.52) for DG, 2.25 (1.89-2.67) for HMG, and 1.32 (1.23-1.40) for HTG (all P < 0.00001). In the subgroup analysis of ethnicity, there was a significant effect of rs3024505 on IBD in Europeans but not non-Europeans: 1.38 (1.31-1.46) for AG, 2.07 (1.73-2.48) for RG, 1.39 (1.31-1.49) for DG, 2.26 (1.89-2.71) for HMG, and 1.33 (1.24-1.42) for HTG in Europeans (all P < 0.00001). Sensitivity analysis showed no dominant study in Europeans, but one study had a dominant impact in Non-Europeans. In conclusion, IL-10_rs3024505 polymorphism confers susceptibility to CD and UC in Europeans, but its impact should have conducted more studies in Non-Europeans.",Liu M; Yuan W; Park S,2022,Cytokine,149,,155721,10.1016/j.cyto.2021.155721,"Liu, M., Yuan, W., & Park, S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Google Scholar, LILACS, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were screened. Caries experience was measured through the Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval was calculated between IBD patients and healthy controls.
RESULTS: Six studies were selected for the inclusion in the systematic review, 5 of which were also included in the quantitative synthesis of data. The WMD in the DMFT index between IBD and healthy subjects was 3.04 (1.52, 4.56) (p = 0.10). Subgroup analysis showed no difference (p = 0.31) between CD (2.52 [0.54, 4.49]) and UC (4.01 [1.52, 4.56]) subjects.

34548985,Mucocutaneous Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and incurable disease, of unknown etiology, associated with an unregulated immune response to environmental triggers in a genetically predisposed host. IBD affects mainly the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, a large percentage of patients may present with extraintestinal manifestations, including mucocutaneous ones (which are the most common) and dermatologic findings, such as erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and aphthous stomatitis (which are the most frequently occurring). According to pathophysiologic mechanisms, mucocutaneous manifestations of IBD are classified into five categories, namely, specific manifestations, associated manifestations, reactive manifestations, adverse effects of IBD therapy, and malabsorption manifestations. Recognizing such manifestations should not be performed only by a dermatologist but also other specialties such as internal medicine, gastroenterology, among others. This is because these manifestations can present before the IBD diagnosis, even in the absence of GI symptoms. Therefore, these skin lesions could be a fundamental tool for the earlier diagnosis of IBD. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the most common cutaneous manifestations of IBD with a focus on their epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation, and available medical treatment.",Alvarez-Payares JC; Ramírez-Urrea S; Correa-Parra L; Salazar-Uribe D; Velásquez-López M,2021,Cureus,13,8,e17191,10.7759/cureus.17191,"Alvarez-Payares, J.

38132266,Clinical Validity of Anti-Proteinase 3 Antibodies in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Short Meta-Analysis.,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) directed to proteinase 3 (PR3) represent highly established markers for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). PR3-ANCA have also demonstrated utility in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). More specifically, PR3-ANCA discriminate individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn's disease (CD) patients and are associated with disease severity, activity, and treatment non-response. Here, we aim to summarize the current data on the diagnostic utility of PR3-ANCA in IBD. A structured, systematic literature review, including three electronic databases, was conducted on June 6th, 2023, to identify studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the QUANTA Flash® PR3 assay in UC vs. CD patients. Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching. A hierarchical, bivariate, mixed-effect meta-analysis was conducted using the metandi function, as per the Cochrane collaboration recommendations. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, which considers the risk of bias and applicability. Six out of a hundred and eleven citations met the inclusion criteria and reported QUANTA Flash® PR3 diagnostic accuracy in UC vs. CD (UC, n = 667, CD, n = 682 patients). The sensitivity/specificity point estimate for UC was 34.9%/95.9%. This resulted in a Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR) of 12.6. The risk of bias was low in the index test and reference standard domains. Four of the six studies (67%) showed an unclear risk of bias in patient selection and in flow and timing domains. All studies had low concerns about applicability in all the domains. PR3-ANCA measured with the QUANTA Flash® PR3 assay represent novel diagnostic markers in IBD and enables discrimination between UC and CD.",Andalucía C; Martínez-Prat L; Bentow C; Aure MA; Horn MP; Mahler M,2023,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",13,24,,10.3390/diagnostics13243682,"Andalucía, C., Martínez-Prat, L., Bentow, C., Aure, M.

34029992,Immune-bacteriophage interactions in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are influenced by the bacterial and fungal organisms found within the intestine. However, the intestine is also home to a vast number of viral particles, with most of them being viruses that infect prokaryotes, called bacteriophages. While use of bacteriophages to specifically target pathogenic bacterial species involved in IBD is currently under investigation, recent studies have also highlighted that these viral particles can impact the mammalian immune system. IBD is a chronic multi-factorial inflammatory condition with unknown etiology. This review will highlight the current investigations that have revealed that bacteriophage-mammalian immune cell interactions can influence disease processes beyond their known role for infecting bacteria, which might identify novel ways to treat or diagnose IBD.",Gogokhia L; Round JL,2021,Current opinion in virology,49,,30-35,10.1016/j.coviro.2021.04.010,"Gogokhia, L., & Round, J.

We will address the existing knowledge on the correlation between inflammation and fibrosis and the still not fully explained inflammation-independent fibrogenesis. Finally, we will compile and discuss the recent advances in the noninvasive assessment of intestinal fibrosis, including imaging and biomarkers. Based on the available data, none of the available cross-sectional imaging (CSI) techniques has proved to be capable of measuring CD fibrosis accurately, with MRE showing the most promising performance along with elastography. Very recent research with radiomics showed encouraging results, but further validation with reliable radiomic biomarkers is warranted. Despite the interesting results with micro-RNAs, further advances on the topic of fibrosis biomarkers depend on the development of robust clinical trials based on solid and validated endpoints. We conclude that it seems very likely that radiomics and AI will participate in the future non-invasive fibrosis assessment by CSI techniques in IBD.

37371959,NAD+ Metabolism and Immune Regulation: New Approaches to Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapies.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a multifactorial systemic inflammatory immune response. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a co-enzyme involved in cell signaling and energy metabolism. Calcium homeostasis, gene transcription, DNA repair, and cell communication involve NAD+ and its degradation products. There is a growing recognition of the intricate relationship between inflammatory diseases and NAD+ metabolism. In the case of IBD, the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis relies on a delicate balance between NAD+ biosynthesis and consumption. Consequently, therapeutics designed to target the NAD+ pathway are promising for the management of IBD. This review discusses the metabolic and immunoregulatory processes of NAD+ in IBD to examine the molecular biology and pathophysiology of the immune regulation of IBD and to provide evidence and theoretical support for the clinical use of NAD+ in IBD.",Chen C; Yan W; Tao M; Fu Y,2023,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",12,6,,10.3390/antiox12061230,"Chen, C., Yan, W., Tao, M., & Fu, Y.

37520885,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between advanced glycation end products ceceptor (RAGE) gene polymorphisms and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE) has been involved. IBD is classified into Chron's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The promoter gene of the RAGE gene was discovered to have had unique polymorphisms that increased its transcriptional activity. This study, therefore, used a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between the RAGE gene polymorphism and the risk of IBD.
METHODS: Databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library were searched to identify the relationship between RAGE gene polymorphisms and IBD susceptibility. We identified three Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) (RAGE-429T/C, 374T/A, and G82S). The data were analyzed by RevMan 5.4.
RESULTS: Four studies (932 cases/1366 controls) were included. The findings showed no relationship between RAGE -429T/C and -G82S polymorphisms and the risk of IBD in all genetic models significantly. TT genotype of RAGE -374T/A polymorphisms was related to increased CD risk (OR=1.37; 95%CI=1.04-1.81; P=0.02), while TA genotype was determined to be a protective factor (OR=0.75; 95%CI=0.57-0.99; P=0.04). In UC, A allele of RAGE -374T/A was related to increase risk (OR=1.26; 95%CI=1.04-1.53; P=0.02), while T allele was determined to decrease risk (OR=0.79; 95%CI= 0.65-0.96; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that TT genotype and A allele of RAGE -374T/A polymorphisms were related to CD and UC risks, respectively, while the TA genotype and T allele possibly had a protective effect. RAGE -429T/C and RAGE -G82S polymorphisms were not related to increased IBD risk.",Febrinasari RP; Indah SP; Bastomy ER; Irving S; Azmiardi A; Pribadi RR; Simadibrata M; Sari Y,2023,Caspian journal of internal medicine,14,3,412-424,10.22088/cjim.14.3.41,"Febrinasari, R.

36807832,Efficacy and Safety of Dual Targeted Therapy for Partially or Non-responsive Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Dual targeted therapy (DTT) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic option for select patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are unable to achieve remission with biologic or small molecule monotherapy. We conducted a systematic review of specific DTT combinations in patients with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library to identify articles related to the use of DTT for the treatment of Crohn Disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) published before February 2021.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified comprising 288 patients started on DTT for partially or non-responsive IBD. We identified 14 studies with 113 patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and anti-integrin therapies (i.e., vedolizumab and natalizumab), 12 studies with 55 patients receiving vedolizumab and ustekinumab, nine studies with 68 patients receiving vedolizumab and tofacitinib, five studies with 24 patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and tofacitinib, six studies with 18 patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and ustekinumab, and three studies with 13 patients receiving ustekinumab and tofacitinib.
CONCLUSION: DTT is a promising approach to improve IBD treatment for patients with incomplete responses to targeted monotherapy. Larger prospective clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings as is additional predictive modeling to identify the patient subgroups most likely to require and benefit from this approach.",Berinstein EM; Sheehan JL; Jacob J; Steiner CA; Stidham RW; Shannon C; Bishu S; Levine J; Cohen-Mekelburg SA; Waljee AK; Higgins PDR; Berinstein JA,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,6,2604-2623,10.1007/s10620-023-07837-0,"Berinstein, E.

37528211,Effectiveness and Safety of Ustekinumab for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: The use of ustekinumab in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is off-label and the data are limited. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in pediatric IBD.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for studies of ustekinumab in children and adolescents with IBD investigating clinical remission, clinical response, corticosteroid-free (CS-free) remission, endoscopic remission/response, or safety up to March 17, 2023. A random-effects model was used for calculating summary estimates.
RESULTS: Eleven studies, comprising 370 patients were included. For Crohn's disease (CD), the pooled clinical remission rates were 34% (73/204) at 8-16 weeks and 46% (60/129) at 1 year. The pooled CS-free clinical remission rates were 23% (10/44) at 8-16 weeks and 45% (42/96) at 1 year. For ulcerative colitis (UC)/IBD unspecified (IBD-U), the pooled CS-free clinical remission rates were 24% (6/25) at 26 weeks and 46% (16/35) at 1 year. Endoscopic remission was found in 0-37.5% of CD and 63.6% of UC. Serious adverse events were reported in 3.5% of patients. About one half of patients required reduction in dose intervals and 62.75% patients could continue ustekinumab therapy at 1 year or final visit.
CONCLUSIONS: According to low-quality evidence mainly from cohort studies and case series, approximately one half of patients with CD and UC/IBD-U achieved remission at 1 year. Ustekinumab has a reasonable safety profile and dose optimization is frequently required. Data on the long-term benefit and high-quality evidence are still needed.",Fang S; Zhang S; Zhang C; Wang L,2023,Paediatric drugs,25,5,499-513,10.1007/s40272-023-00586-7,"Fang, S., Zhang, S., Zhang, C., & Wang, L.

31591455,The association between inflammatory bowel disease and prostate cancer risk: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal malignancies. However, the associations between IBD and prostate cancer (PCa) risk remain conflicting.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) or relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the relationship of IBD and PCa risk.
RESULTS: For cohort studies, the pooled SIR was 1.33 (95% CI = 1.03-1.71). The further subgroup analysis showed that the PCa risk was higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (pooled SIR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08-2.30), but not in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled SIR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.97-1.31). Besides, for the three case-control studies, the results indicated that compared with normal group, the pooled RR of PCa was 1.81 for the patients with IBD (95% CI = 1.43-2.29). In addition, sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust and no significant publication bias were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings based on the large and multicenter samples strongly indicated that men with IBD especial UC have significantly elevated PCa risk.

32463159,Systematic review and meta-analysis: Association of a pre-illness Western dietary pattern with the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have presented conflicting results on Western diets and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to evaluate the role of a pre-illness Western dietary pattern in the development of IBD.
METHODS: The Western dietary pattern was defined as that met at least two of the following, either a high intake of refined grains, red and processed meat, animal protein, animal fats or high-fat dairy products, or with a low consumption of fruit and vegetables. Four medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched to identify all relevant references. Risk estimate and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Nine studies (seven case-control studies and two prospective cohorts) were included, with a total of 1491 IBD cases and 53 089 controls. A Western dietary pattern was associated with a risk of all IBD (relative risk [RR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.37-2.68) and separately with Crohn's disease (CD) (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01-2.93) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.38-3.34). Subgroup analysis by region showed that a Western dietary pattern was associated with the risk of CD and UC for studies performed in Europe (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.44-3.50 for CD; RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.61-4.36 for UC). The pooled RR was 2.26 (95% CI 1.42-3.59) in the pediatric CD subgroup.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that a pre-illness Western dietary pattern may increase the risk of developing CD and UC.",Li T; Qiu Y; Yang HS; Li MY; Zhuang XJ; Zhang SH; Feng R; Chen BL; He Y; Zeng ZR; Chen MH,2020,Journal of digestive diseases,21,7,362-371,10.1111/1751-2980.12910,"Li, T., Qiu, Y., Yang, H.

40025407,Pathological characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder in which intestinal homeostasis is disrupted for some reason. Among them, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are frequently referred to as IBD in the narrow sense, characterized by relapse episodes and remission periods. The differential diagnosis of IBD involves a broad spectrum of inflammatory or infectious diseases that mimic UC and/or CD, as well as others that may complicate existing IBD. Accordingly, these differential diseases and modifying factors should be considered in their pathological diagnosis, and a careful diagnosis should be made in close collaboration with clinicians. Here, we provide a pathological overview of UC, CD, and their differential diseases, as well as IBD-associated cancers, demonstrating their typical gross and histological features. Further, we introduce a pathological scoring system for biopsy specimens to diagnose IBD that may potentially be integrated into clinical practice.",Nakajima M; Iwao Y; Okabayashi K; Kanai Y; Shimoda M,2025,Journal of medical ultrasonics (2001),52,2,187-196,10.1007/s10396-025-01520-9,"Nakajima, M., Iwao, Y., Okabayashi, K., Kanai, Y., & Shimoda, M.

METHODS: A systematic review was performed of observational studies reporting the epidemiological, clinical, patient-reported and economic burden of IBD in the Spanish population, from 2011 to 2021. Original articles and conference abstracts published in English or Spanish were eligible.
RESULTS: A total of 45 publications were included in the review. The incidence of IBD in adults ranged from 9.6 to 44.3 per 100,000 inhabitants (4.6 to 18.5 for CD and 3.4 to 26.5 for UC). The incidence increased between 1.5- and twofold from 2000 to 2016 (regionally). Up to 6.0% (CD) and 3.0% (UC) IBD-associated mortality was reported. Disease onset predominantly occurs between 30 and 40 years (more delayed for UC than CD). Most frequently reported gastrointestinal manifestations are rectal bleeding in UC and weight loss in CD. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) have been described in up to 47.4% of patients with CD and 48.1% of patients with UC. Psychiatric comorbidities were frequently reported in both CD and UC (depression up to 20% and anxiety up to 11%). Reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to the general population was reported. Significant symptomatology was associated with high levels of anxiety, depression, stress and lower HRQoL. Main healthcare resources reported were emergency department visits (24.0%), hospitalization (14.7%), surgery (up to 11%) and use of biologics (up to 60%), especially in CD. Direct and indirect annual costs per patient with UC were €1754.1 and €399.3, respectively.

32919423,Epidemiologic Association between Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: a Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are at high risk of developing several autoimmune diseases. However, the epidemiological connection between IBD and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between the two diseases.
METHODS: A literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, and Central databases from inception to December 31, 2019. Studies evaluating the prevalence of T1DM in patients with IBD and controls were included. Statistical analysis was performed with a random effects model using the generic inverse variance method.
RESULTS: After the literature research, five cross-sectional studies and one case-control study met the inclusion criteria. A total of 45,103 participants with Crohn's disease (CD) and 76,046 with ulcerative colitis (UC) were included. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of T1DM were 1.16 (confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.87-1.55) in patients with CD and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.90-1.59) in patients with UC compared with the control groups. Significant heterogeneity was observed (CD: I 2 =70% and UC: I 2 =80%) in the complete analysis. Subgroup analysis stratified by study region was performed. Recalculated results indicated a positive association between CD and TD1M in Northern Europe with an OR of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.43-1.90; I 2 =0%). Patients with UC in Israel were at a higher risk of developing T1DM with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.38-2.09; I 2 =0%).
CONCLUSION: The complete meta-analysis suggests no association between IBD and T1DM.

38203373,Selected Cytokines and Metalloproteinases in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a collective term for two diseases: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). There are many factors, e.g., genetic, environmental and immunological, that increase the likelihood of these diseases. Indicators of IBDs include extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The aim of this review is to present data on the role of selected cytokines and metalloproteinases in IBD. In recent years, more and more transcriptomic studies are emerging. These studies are improving the characterization of the cytokine microenvironment inside inflamed tissue. It is observed that the levels of several cytokines are consistently increased in inflamed tissue in IBD, both in UC and CD. This review shows that MMPs play a major role in the pathology of inflammatory processes, cancer, and IBD. IBD-associated inflammation is associated with increased expression of MMPs and reduced ability of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to inhibit their action. In IBD patients in tissues that are inflamed, MMPs are produced in excess and TIMP activity is not sufficient to block MMPs. This review is based on our personal selection of the literature that was retrieved by a selective search in PubMed using the terms ""Inflammatory bowel disease"" and ""pathogenesis of Inflammatory bowel diseases"" that includes systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials. The involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of IBD is reviewed in terms of the role of the cytokines and metalloproteinases involved.",Sosna B; Aebisher D; Myśliwiec A; Dynarowicz K; Bartusik-Aebisher D; Oleś P; Cieślar G; Kawczyk-Krupka A,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,25,1,,10.3390/ijms25010202,"Sosna, B., Aebisher, D., Myśliwiec, A., Dynarowicz, K., Bartusik-Aebisher, D., Oleś, P., Cieślar, G., & Kawczyk-Krupka, A.

The impact of sex on the disease course and the clinical outcomes not fully understood. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the differences in the clinical outcomes in IBD.
METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was done by searching in the PubMed /MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used the Random-Effects model to estimate risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes and mean difference and hedges' g for continuous outcomes.
RESULT: A total of 44 unique studies were included. Our analysis revealed distinct sex differences in various outcomes of IBD. Anxiety was more prevalent in females (RR: 0.73; 95% CI [0.64, 0.82]) and females in the CD subgroup (RR: 0.76; 95% CI [0.62, 0.93]; p = 0.01. While depression was diagnosed more frequently in females (RR: 0.80; 95% CI [0.66, 0.97] in the total population of the study, subgroup analysis showed no sex difference. Additionally, quality of life scores were worse in females in the total population (Hedges' g: 0.24; 95% CI [0.05, 0.42]) with no significant difference in subgroup analyses. A significantly higher mortality risk was estimated in males (RR: 1.26; 95% CI [1.07, 1.48]) and in subgroup analysis for males with UC (RR: 1.48; 95% CI [1.19, 1.84]; p = 0.00) with no significant difference in CD. Regarding disease location, male patients were less likely to present with proctitis (RR: 0.67; 95% CI [0.50, 0.91]) when compared to females. Males had more frequent indications for surgery (RR: 1.10; 95% CI [1.01, 1.20]), however, no significant difference was found in subgroup analyses for CD or UC. Also, males were older at the time of admission (MD: 1.39 years; 95% CI [0.10, 2.68]). No significant sex differences were found in terms of hospitalization rates or disease behavior.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our meta-analysis shows that males face higher risks of early mortality and require more IBD surgeries, whereas females experience greater levels of anxiety and depression. These findings emphasize the need to consider sex disparities in IBD management.",Salem DA; El-Ijla R; AbuMusameh RR; Zakout KA; Abu Halima AY; Abudiab MT; Banat YM; Alqeeq BF; Al-Tawil M; Matar K,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,425,10.1186/s12876-024-03514-2,"Salem, D.

39403053,Review article: Measuring disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease - Beyond treat to target.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) follows a heterogenous disease course and predicting a patient's prognosis is challenging. There is a wide burden of illness in IBD and existing tools measure disease activity at a snapshot in time. Comprehensive assessment of IBD severity should incorporate disease activity, prognosis, and the impacts of disease on a patient. This review investigates the concept of disease severity in adults with IBD to highlight key components contributing to this.
METHODS: To perform this narrative review, a Medline search was conducted for full-text articles available at 1st March 2024 using search terms which encompassed disease activity assessment, disease severity, prognosis, natural history of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and the burden of IBD.
RESULTS: Current methods of disease assessment in IBD have evolved from a focus on the burden of symptoms to one that includes inflammatory targets, genetic, serological, and proteomic profiles, and assessments of quality-of-life (QoL), disability, and psychosocial health. Longitudinal studies of IBD suggest that the burden of illness is driven by disease phenotype, clinical markers of complicated disease course (previous intestinal resection, corticosteroid use, perianal disease in CD, recent hospitalisations in UC), gut inflammation, and the impact of IBD on the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity in IBD can be difficult to conceptualise due to the multitude of factors that contribute to IBD outcomes. Measurement of IBD severity may better encapsulate the full burden of illness rather than gut inflammation alone at a single timepoint and may be associated with longitudinal outcomes.",Swaminathan A; Day AS; Sparrow MP; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Siegel CA; Gearry RB,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,60,9,1176-1199,10.1111/apt.18231,"Swaminathan, A., Day, A.

34928348,Meta-Analysis of IBD Gut Samples Gene Expression Identifies Specific Markers of Ileal and Colonic Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue damages in limited segments of the digestive tract. Pathogenesis in the tissue and mucosal inflammation probably differs according to disease location. Our aim was to further analyze transcriptomic profiles in different locations of IBD, differentiating ulcerative colitis (UC), colonic Crohn's disease (CD), ileal CD, and pouchitis, with respect to normal colonic and ileal mucosa. We thus performed a meta-analysis focusing on specific transcriptomic signatures of ileal and colonic diseases.
METHODS: We identified 5 cohorts with available transcriptomic data in ileal or colonic samples from active IBD and non-IBD control samples. The meta-analysis was performed on 1047 samples. In each cohort separately, we compared gene expression in CD ileitis and normal ileum; in CD colitis, UC, and normal colon; and finally in pouchitis and normal ileum.
RESULTS: We identified specific markers of ileal (FOLH1, CA2) and colonic (REG3A) inflammation and showed that, with disease, some cells from the ileum start to express colonic markers. We confirmed by immunohistochemistry that these markers were specifically present in ileal or colonic diseases. We highlighted that, overall, colonic CD resembles UC and is distinct from ileal CD, which is in turn closer to pouchitis.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that ileal and colonic diseases exhibit specific signatures, independent of their initial clinical classification. This supports molecular, rather than clinical, disease stratification, and may be used to design drugs specifically targeting ileal or colonic diseases.",Perez K; Ngollo M; Rabinowitz K; Hammoudi N; Seksik P; Xavier RJ; Daly MJ; Dotan I; Le Bourhis L; Allez M,2022,Inflammatory bowel diseases,28,5,775-782,10.1093/ibd/izab311,"Perez, K., Ngollo, M., Rabinowitz, K., Hammoudi, N., Seksik, P., Xavier, R.

35441942,Cutaneous Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Basic Overview.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that is subdivided into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD is characterized by involvement of the entire GI tract, while UC mainly affects the distal GI tract. Moreover, both CD and UC can present with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of the disease affecting multiple organ systems including the hepatobiliary tract, kidney, bones, eyes, joints, and skin. These complications can cause significant morbidity and negatively impact the quality of life for IBD patients. Although the pathogenesis of EIMs is not clearly elucidated, it is postulated that the diseased GI mucosa similarly stimulates excess immune responses at the extraintestinal sites. Cutaneous EIMs occur in up to 15% of patients with IBD, often predating their IBD diagnosis. They are categorized into (1) specific, (2) reactive, (3) associated, and (4) treatment-induced. Here, we review the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, and histologic features of the most commonly described cutaneous EIMs of IBD along with their respective treatment options.",Pagani K; Lukac D; Bhukhan A; McGee JS,2022,American journal of clinical dermatology,23,4,481-497,10.1007/s40257-022-00689-w,"Pagani, K., Lukac, D., Bhukhan, A., & McGee, J.

35075587,Inflammatory bowel disease as a new risk factor for dementia.,"The prognostic impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic inflammatory conditions consisting of ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) on the risk of dementia has been poorly investigated. We evaluated the risk of dementia in IBD patients by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data. Three studies, enrolling 121.827 patients [14.839 IBD (12.1%) and 106.961 (87.7%) controls, respectively] were included in the analysis. Of these, 57.7% (n = 8.571) had UC, while 42.2% (n = 6268) had CD. The mean follow-up period was 21.3 years. A random effect model revealed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI 1.04-2.020, p = 0.01; I2 = 91.1%) for dementia in IBD patients. Sensitivity analysis confirmed yielded results. Subjects having a CD showed an aHR for dementia of 1.48 (95% CI 1.07-2.03, p = 0.001, I2 = 68.9%), while the risk among those with a history of UC did not reach the statistical significance (aHR: 1.47, 95% CI 0.95-2.82, p = 0.81, I2 = 89.9%). IBD males had an increased risk of dementia compared to women. IBD patients and in particular those with CD have an increased risk of dementia in the long-term period.",Zuin M; De Giorgio R; Capatti E; Boschetti E; Zuliani G,2022,Aging clinical and experimental research,34,7,1725-1728,10.1007/s40520-022-02076-1,"Zuin, M., De Giorgio, R., Capatti, E., Boschetti, E., & Zuliani, G.

39459580,New Role of the Serotonin as a Biomarker of Gut-Brain Interaction.,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT), a neurotransmitter that regulates mood in the brain and signaling in the gut, has receptors throughout the body that serve various functions, especially in the gut and brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat depression, but their efficacy is uncertain. Depression is often associated with early gastrointestinal symptoms. Gut disorders such as functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are linked to elevated serotonin levels. In this review, we would like to discuss the approach of using serotonin as a biomarker for gut-brain, and body-wide organ communication may lead to the development of preventive and innovative treatments for gut-brain disorders, offering improved visibility and therapeutic monitoring. It could also be used to gauge stress intensity for self-care and mental health improvement.",Liu HN; Nakamura M; Kawashima H,2024,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",14,10,,10.3390/life14101280,"Liu, H.

39545600,Vascular endothelial growth factor in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIM: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is linked to inflammation and angiogenesis, indicating a possible role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its main clinical manifestations, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated studies assessing circulating VEGF concentrations in IBD patients and healthy controls, considering the effect of IBD type, sample type and geographical location.
METHODS: A systematic search identified 18 studies (28 group comparators) investigating 1741 IBD patients and 1291 controls. Data were extracted and analysed using standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in IBD patients (SMD = .71, 95% CI .38 to 1.04; p < .001). UC patients showed higher VEGF concentrations than CD patients. Serum samples indicated significant VEGF elevations, unlike plasma samples. Significant VEGF increases were observed in studies conducted in Western Europe and Asia, but not in Eastern Europe. No significant differences were found between active and inactive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: VEGF concentrations are elevated in IBD patients, with variations by disease type, sample type and geography. However, VEGF is not a reliable marker of disease activity. Future research should standardize methods and explore regional influences to enhance VEGF's clinical utility as a biomarker of IBD.",Zoroddu S; Di Lorenzo B; Paliogiannis P; Mangoni AA; Carru C; Zinellu A,2025,European journal of clinical investigation,55,3,e14361,10.1111/eci.14361,"Zoroddu, S., Di Lorenzo, B., Paliogiannis, P., Mangoni, A.

40140901,Gut virome and its implications in the pathogenesis and therapeutics of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to chronic, recurrent inflammatory intestinal disorders, primarily including Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). Numerous studies have elucidated the importance of the gut microbiome in IBD. Recently, numerous studies have focused on the gut virome, an intriguing and enigmatic aspect of the gut microbiome. Alterations in the composition of phages, eukaryotic viruses, and human endogenous retroviruses that occur in IBD suggest potential involvement of the gut virome in IBD. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which it maintains intestinal homeostasis and interacts with diseases are only beginning to be understood. Here, we thoroughly reviewed the composition of the gut virome in both healthy individuals and IBD patients, emphasizing the key viruses implicated in the onset and progression of IBD. Furthermore, the complex connections between the gut virome and the intestinal barrier, immunity, and gut microbiome were dissected to advance the interpretation of IBD pathogenesis. The updated discussion of the evidence regarding the gut virome will advance our knowledge in gut virome and chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Targeting the gut virome is a promising avenue for IBD treatment in future.",Wu Y; Cheng R; Lin H; Li L; Jia Y; Philips A; Zuo T; Zhang H,2025,BMC medicine,23,1,183,10.1186/s12916-025-04016-y,"Wu, Y., Cheng, R., Lin, H., Li, L., Jia, Y., Philips, A., Zuo, T., & Zhang, H.

35145045,What Are the Different Phenotypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Asia?,"The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Asia has been increasing over the past decades. Although patients with IBD show heterogenous phenotypes depending on the individual characteristics, no significant differences have been established in the IBD phenotypes of Western and Asian populations. However, despite the much lower incidence of IBD in Asia than in Western countries, the incidence has been rapidly increasing in Asia while remaining stable in Western countries. The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) showed an earlier and a more marked increase than the incidence of Crohn disease (CD), but the UC-to-CD ratio has recently decreased because of a relative increase in the incidence of CD in Asia. While CD shows a significant male predominance, UC only shows a slight male predominance. A recent study reported that the incidence of IBD in Asia showed a bimodal age distribution with increasing IBD prevalence, similar to the findings of Western studies. CD in Asian patients, especially those in East Asia, is characterized by ileocolonic involvement and perianal fistula. The frequency of extraintestinal manifestations, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, appears to be lower in Asia, but this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the transient and nonspecific nature of these manifestations. Although familial aggregation is lower in East Asia, it may also be explained by the low prevalence of IBD in Asia. Thus, more studies should focus on the differences in phenotypes in Asian IBD patients versus Western patients.",Park SB; Yoon JY; Cha JM,2022,Gut and liver,16,5,676-685,10.5009/gnl210385,"Park, S.

32558695,microRNA in inflammatory bowel disease at a glance.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a chronic inflammation in colon and small intestine has two subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Genome studies have shown that UC and CD are related to microRNAs (miRNAs) expression in addition to environmental factors. This article reviews important researches that have recently been done on miRNAs roles in CD and UC disease. First, miRNA is introduced and its biogenesis and function are discussed. Afterward, roles of miRNAs in inflammatory processes involved in IBD are showed. Finally, this review proposes some circulating and tissue-specific miRNAs, which are useful for CD and UC fast diagnosis and grade prediction. As a conclusion, miRNAs are efficient diagnostic molecules especially in IBD subtypes discrimination and can be used by microarray and real time PCR methods for disease detection and classification.",Alamdari-Palangi V; Vahedi F; Shabaninejad Z; Dokeneheifard S; Movehedpour A; Taheri-Anganeh M; Savardashtaki A,2021,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,32,2,140-148,10.1097/MEG.0000000000001815,"Alamdari-Palangi, V., Vahedi, F., Shabaninejad, Z., Dokeneheifard, S., Movehedpour, A., Taheri-Anganeh, M., & Savardashtaki, A.

38895124,Role of long non-coding RNA in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of recurrent chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although IBD has been extensively studied for decades, its cause and pathogenesis remain unclear. Existing research suggests that IBD may be the result of an interaction between genetic factors, environmental factors and the gut microbiome. IBD is closely related to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). NcRNAs are composed of microRNA(miRNA), long non-coding RNA(lnc RNA) and circular RNA(circ RNA). Compared with miRNA, the role of lnc RNA in IBD has been little studied. Lnc RNA is an RNA molecule that regulates gene expression and regulates a variety of molecular pathways involved in the pathbiology of IBD. Targeting IBD-associated lnc RNAs may promote personalized treatment of IBD and have therapeutic value for IBD patients. Therefore, this review summarized the effects of lnc RNA on the intestinal epithelial barrier, inflammatory response and immune homeostasis in IBD, and summarized the potential of lnc RNA as a biomarker of IBD and as a predictor of therapeutic response to IBD in the future.",Hu Y; Lu Y; Fang Y; Zhang Q; Zheng Z; Zheng X; Ye X; Chen Y; Ding J; Yang J,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1406538,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1406538,"Hu, Y., Lu, Y., Fang, Y., Zhang, Q., Zheng, Z., Zheng, X., Ye, X., Chen, Y., Ding, J., & Yang, J.

33721889,Ethnic Differences in the Smoking-related Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between smoking and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] relies on old meta-analyses including exclusively non-Jewish White populations. Uncertainty persists regarding the role of smoking in other ethnicities.
METHODS: We systematically searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for studies examining tobacco smoking and the risk of developing IBD, ie, Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]. Two authors independently extracted study data and assessed each study's risk of bias. We examined heterogeneity and small-study effect, and calculated summary estimates using random-effects models. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were employed to study the association between study-level characteristics and effect estimates. The strength of epidemiological evidence was assessed through prespecified criteria.
RESULTS: We synthesised 57 studies examining the smoking-related risk of developing CD and UC. Non-Jewish White smokers were at increased risk of CD (29 studies; relative risk [RR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69‒2.24; moderate evidence). No association was observed in Asian, Jewish. and Latin-American populations [11 studies; RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.83-1.13], with no evidence of heterogeneity across these ethnicities. Smokers were at reduced risk of UC [51 studies; RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.48-0.64; weak evidence] irrespectively of ethnicity; however, cohort studies, large studies, and those recently published showed attenuated associations.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis did not identify any increased risk of CD in smokers in ethnicities other than non-Jewish Whites, and confirmed the protective effect of smoking on UC occurrence. Future research should characterise the genetic background of CD patients across different ethnicities to improve our understanding of the role of smoking in CD pathogenesis.",Piovani D; Pansieri C; Kotha SRR; Piazza AC; Comberg CL; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S; Bonovas S,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,10,1658-1678,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab047,"Piovani, D., Pansieri, C., Kotha, S.

33079779,Systematic review and meta-analysis: risks of postoperative complications with preoperative use of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha biologics in inflammatory bowel disease patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The preoperative use of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients undergoing surgery has been controversial due to concern for increased risks of postoperative complications. We aimed to determine the effect of preoperative anti-TNF therapy on postoperative complications in IBD patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
METHODS: A literature search of Google Scholar, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL was performed through October 2019. Studies reporting postoperative complication rates of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD-unspecified patients with preoperative anti-TNF treatment undergoing abdominal surgery compared to controls without preoperative anti-TNF treatment were included. The main outcomes measured were overall, infectious, and noninfectious postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Forty-one studies totaling 20 274 patients were included. There was a significant increase in overall complications in all patients treated with anti-TNF vs. controls [odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.25, P = 0.03, I2 = 6%] with an absolute risk increase (ARI) of 5.5% and a number needed to harm (NNH) of 18. There was also a significant increase in infectious complications in CD patients (OR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.02-2.03, P = 0.04, I2 = 49%, ARI = 5.5%, NNH = 20) only. Contrastingly, there was a significant increase in noninfectious complications in all patients (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.13-1.85, P = 0.003, I2 = 8%, ARI = 6.4%, NNH = 16) and UC patients (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.15-2.14, P = 0.005, I2 = 25%, ARI = 8.5%, NNH = 12) only.

38970234,The association between bilirubin concentrations and inflammatory bowel disease: Insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), poses a significant challenge to health care systems because of its chronic nature and increasing global prevalence. Effective management of IBD requires accurate diagnostic tools and biomarkers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between bilirubin concentrations and IBD activity and outcomes.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases identified 11 studies that included 2606 subjects with IBD and 3607 healthy controls.
RESULTS: Bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with IBD when compared to controls (SMD = -0.96, 95% CI -1.21 to -0.70; p < .001). Although substantial heterogeneity was observed, sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. Publication bias was detected, but subgroup analyses did not significantly alter the results. Meta-regression showed that age was a significant factor influencing the association between bilirubin concentrations and IBD. Subgroup analyses showed a more pronounced reduction in bilirubin concentrations in subjects with CD than those with UC.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the potential utility of bilirubin as a biomarker in IBD, emphasizing the need for further research to validate its clinical significance.",Zoroddu S; Di Lorenzo B; Paliogiannis P; Mangoni AA; Carru C; Zinellu A,2024,European journal of clinical investigation,54,11,e14281,10.1111/eci.14281,"Zoroddu, S., Di Lorenzo, B., Paliogiannis, P., Mangoni, A.

31504363,Global Prevalence and Bidirectional Association Between Psoriasis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease-A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemiological studies have established an association between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], i.e. ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD], but results are inconsistent. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the prevalences and association between IBD and psoriasis.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched from database inception through April 2018 for studies reporting data on psoriasis among patients with IBD and vice versa. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate, respectively, the prevalences and association between IBD and psoriasis. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guideline, and quality assessment was made using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The main outcomes were the proportion of psoriasis patients with IBD and vice versa, as well as the association (odds ratio [OR]) of IBD in psoriasis and psoriasis in IBD, respectively.
RESULTS: Based on quantitative analysis of 93 studies, the prevalence of psoriasis in CD and in UC was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1%-4.6%) and 2.8% [95% CI 2.0%-3.8%] respectively. The prevalence of CD and UC was 0.7% [95% CI 0.2%-1.3%] and 0.5% [95% CI 0.3%-0.8%], respectively, among patients with psoriasis. Presence of CD or UC was significantly associated with psoriasis, with OR 2.0 [95% CI 1.4-2.9] and OR 1.5 [95% CI 1.2-2.0], respectively. Presence of psoriasis was significantly associated with CD: OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.6-3.1] and with UC: OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.3-2.0].

32898579,Risk of Cancers in Patients with Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of the development of cancers in patients with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
STUDY DESIGN: A computerized literature search was performed. The primary outcome was the pooled incidence of cancer in studies reporting the risk as a standardized incidence ratio. The secondary outcomes were the pooled incidence rates of all cancers and site-specific cancers including colorectal cancer and hematologic cancers.
RESULTS: Sixty-six studies reporting outcomes in 38 092 patients were included. The pooled standardized incidence ratio for cancer was 2.39 (P < .0001, 95% CI 2.00-2.86) in IBD. The pooled incidence rates for cancer in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were 0.014 (95% CI 0.0087-0.021) and 0.031 (95% CI 0.018-0.052), respectively. The pooled incidence rate of colorectal cancer in CD and UC were 0.0075 (95% CI 0.0049-0.011) and 0.020 (95% CI 0.012-0.034), respectively. The pooled rates of hematologic cancers in CD and UC were 0.0061 (95% CI 0.0040-0.0090) and 0.0045 (95% CI 0.0026-0.0079), respectively.

36715839,Diagnostic delay in adult inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The extent of diagnostic delay in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is incompletely understood. We aimed to understand the extent of diagnostic delay of IBD in adults and identify associations between patient or healthcare characteristics and length of delay.
METHODS: Articles were sourced from EMBASE, Medline and CINAHL from inception to April 2021. Inclusion criteria were adult cohorts (18 ≥ years old) reporting median time periods between onset of symptoms for Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) or IBD (i.e. CD and UC together) and a final diagnosis (diagnostic delay). Narrative synthesis was used to examine the extent of diagnostic delay and characteristics associated with delay. Sensitivity analysis was applied by the removal of outliers.
RESULTS: Thirty-one articles reporting median diagnostic delay for IBD, CD or UC were included. After sensitivity analysis, the majority of IBD studies (7 of 8) reported a median delay of between 2 and 5.3 months. From the studies examining median delay in UC, three-quarters (12 of 16) reported a delay between 2 and 6 months. In contrast, three-quarters of the CD studies (17 of 23) reported a delay of between 2 and 12 months. No characteristic had been examined enough to understand their role in diagnostic delay in these populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides robust insight into the extent of diagnostic delay in IBD and suggests further intervention is needed to reduce delay in CD particularly. Furthermore, our findings provide a benchmark value range for diagnostic delay, which such future work can be measured against.",Cross E; Saunders B; Farmer AD; Prior JA,2023,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,42,1,40-52,10.1007/s12664-022-01303-x,"Cross, E., Saunders, B., Farmer, A.

Although dairy consumption has been linked to various chronic diseases, its relationship with IBD remains uncertain. Additionally, there is a lack of data on this topic from Arab countries. This study aimed to investigate the association between dairy consumption and IBD through a case-control study among Arab populations, followed by a meta-analysis of available studies.
METHOD: First, we used data from 158 UC patients, 244 CD patients, and 395 controls attending a polyclinic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All participants were aged ≥ 18 years. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of UC and CD for individuals who reported the highest versus the lowest frequencies of dairy consumption. Next, we conducted a meta-analysis, combining our results with those from other eligible studies after searching several databases. We used the I2 statistics to examine statistical heterogeneity across studies and the regression test for funnel plot asymmetry to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: The case-control study showed a negative association between frequent dairy consumption and UC (OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.41, 1.00)) but not CD (OR (95% CI) = 0.97 (0.65, 1.45)). In the meta-analysis, the highest frequencies of dairy consumption were negatively associated with both UC and CD: ORs (95% CIs) = 0.82 (0.68, 0.98) and 0.72 (0.59, 0.87), respectively. A moderate heterogeneity across studies was noticed in the UC meta-analysis (I2 = 59.58%) and the CD meta-analysis (I2 = 41.16%). No publication bias was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Frequent dairy consumption could protect against the development of UC and CD, suggesting potential dietary recommendations in the context of IBD prevention.",Almofarreh AM; Sheerah HA; Arafa A; Al Mubarak AS; Ali AM; Al-Otaibi NM; Alzahrani MA; Aljubayl AR; Aleid MA; Alhamed SS,2024,Nutrients,16,16,,10.3390/nu16162747,"Almofarreh, A.

35166398,Review article: emerging drug therapies in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: The landscape of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment is rapidly expanding with the development of new therapeutic options.
AIM: To review the mechanisms of action and the available clinical trial data on emerging drug therapies for IBD.
METHODS: Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases were queried up to July 2021 using keywords ""inflammatory bowel disease,"" ""IBD,"" ""Crohn's disease,"" ""ulcerative colitis"" and ""trial,"" ""phase"" and ""study."" In addition, we manually reviewed the grey literature including clinical trial registries and abstracts from major gastroenterology conferences in 2020 and 2021 to include pertinent information.
RESULTS: In ulcerative colitis (UC), phase 2b and/or phase 3 studies met primary endpoints for S1P receptor agonists (estrasimod, ozanimod), anti-IL-23 agent (mirikizumab), anti-lymphocyte trafficking agents (ontamalimab, subcutaneous vedolizumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, filgotinib) and TLR9 agonist (cobitolimod). In Crohn's disease (CD), anti-IL-23 agents (risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, filgotinib) and anti-lymphocyte trafficking agents (ontamalimab, etrolizumab) met primary endpoints in randomised controlled clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: Several new IBD drug therapies have positive efficacy and safety data in early clinical trials, and there are several drugs in the therapeutic pipeline. As more treatments for CD and UC are approved for clinical use, research to assess predictors of response to therapy and head-to-head trials is needed to inform providers on how to best position therapeutic options for patients with IBD.",Grossberg LB; Papamichael K; Cheifetz AS,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,7,789-804,10.1111/apt.16785,"Grossberg, L.

35160159,Surgical Management of Hemorrhoidal Disease in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review with Proportional Meta-Analysis.,"Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease (HD) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been considered to be potentially harmful, but the evidence for this is poor. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to reappraise the safety and effectiveness of surgical treatments in this special circumstance. A MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library search was performed to retrieve studies reporting the outcomes of surgical treatment of HD in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). From a total of 2072 citations, 10 retrospective studies including 222 (range, 2-70) patients were identified. Of these, 119 (54%) had CD and 103 (46%) UC. Mean age was between 41 and 49 years (range 14-77). Most studies lacked information on the interval between surgery and the onset of complications. Operative treatments included open or closed hemorrhoidectomy (n = 156 patients (70%)), rubber band ligation (n = 39 (18%)), excision or incision of thrombosed hemorrhoid (n = 14 (6%)), and doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DG-HAL, n = 13 (6%)). In total, 23 patients developed a complication (pooled prevalence, 9%; (95%CI, 3-16%)), with a more than two-fold higher rate in patients with CD compared to UC (11% (5-16%) vs. 5% (0-13%), respectively). Despite the low quality evidence, surgical management of HD in IBD and particularly in CD patients who have failed nonoperative therapy should still be performed with caution and limited to inactive disease. Further studies should determine whether advantages in terms of safety and effectiveness with the use of non-excisional techniques (e.g., DG-HAL) can be obtained in this patient population.",Grossi U; Gallo G; Di Tanna GL; Bracale U; Ballo M; Galasso E; Kazemi Nava A; Zucchella M; Cinetto F; Rattazzi M; Felice C; Zanus G,2022,Journal of clinical medicine,11,3,,10.3390/jcm11030709,"Grossi, U., Gallo, G., Di Tanna, G.

37206474,"Incidence of lymphomas in inflammatory bowel disease: report of an emblematic case, systematic review, and meta-analysis.","INTRODUCTION: Over the past 20 years, the increasing use of combined therapy with immunosuppressants and biologic agents has markedly reduced the use of steroids in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, medical therapy seems to promote, in the long run, carcinogenesis resulting in an increased risk of developing different types of malignancies, including lymphomas. The aim of this study was to systematically review the current incidence and prognosis of lymphoid neoplasms occurring in patients with IBD.
METHODS: Studies analyzing the incidence of lymphomas in subjects of age >18 years affected by IBD were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies focusing on pediatric populations, not reporting person-years of follow-up, or with a duration < 1 year were excluded. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central Register were searched from inception through January 2022. Publication bias within studies was assessed using Begg's and Egger's tests and random effects model. Quantitative results were synthesized using relative-risk meta-analysis. PRISMA guidelines were used to carry out this systematic review (PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42023398348).
RESULTS: A total of 345 studies published between 1985 and 2022, with a total of 6,17,386 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Substantial heterogeneity between studies prevented the pooling of estimates (I2 = 97.19%). Evidence of publication bias was overall low (p = 0.1941). Patients affected by Crohn's disease (CD) were 1,86,074 (30.13%), while 2,78,876 (46.17%) were diagnosed with UC. The remaining 23.7% of cases were diagnosed with indeterminate colitis. Immunomodulators and biologic therapy were used in 24,520 (5.27%), and 17,972 (3.86%) patients, respectively. Reported incidence rates for lymphoma in IBD ranged from 0.0/100,000 person/years (py) (95% CI 0.0-3.7/100,000) to 89/100,000 py (95% CI 36-160/100,000). Reported incidence rates of lymphoma in CD ranged from 0.0/100,000 py (95% CI 0.0-3.7/100,000) to 91/100,000 py (95% CI 18-164/100,000). For UC, the incidence rate ranged from 0.0/100,000 py (95% CI 0.0-3.7/100,000) to 95/100,000 py (95% CI 0-226/100,000). Male-to-female ratio was ~4:1. Therapy with immunomodulators was directly associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma (p < 0.0001). Evidence of publication bias was overall low (p = 0 .1941).
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence arising from this study highlights a correlation between the use of immunomodulators and subsequent lymphoma development. Combined multidisciplinary approach and long-term follow-up are warranted in order to decrease mortality deriving from the coexistence of both conditions.

31955167,The Bidirectional Association between Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have suggested a significant association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). Yet, outcomes published remain inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between IBD and AD by a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies published from March 1, 1968, to July 26, 2019, was performed in electronic databases as follows: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Methodological quality was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data analysis was conducted using R version 3.6.1 (meta package version 4.9-7).
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies were eligible for exploring the association between IBD and AD. Statistically significant differences were found on the risk of AD comorbidity among patients with IBD (risk ratio [RR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.39-2.40), Crohn's disease (CD; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.61-2.64), and ulcerative colitis (UC; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.23-2.24). Compared with non-AD subjects, patients with AD were 48% (p = 0.019), 44% (p = 0.002), and 38% (p = 0.000) more likely to exhibit IBD, CD as well as UC, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Our evidence supported a significant bidirectional association between IBD and AD.

35323020,Food as Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), namely, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lifelong and incurable chronic inflammatory diseases affecting 6.8 million people worldwide. By 2030, the prevalence of IBD is estimated to reach 1% of the population in Western countries, and thus there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies to reduce the burden of this disease. Microbiome dysbiosis is at the heart of the IBD pathophysiology, and current research and development efforts for IBD treatments have been focused on gut microbiome regulation. Diet can shape the intestinal microbiome. Diet is also preferred over medication, is safe, and has been proven to be an effective strategy for the management of IBD. Therefore, although often overlooked, dietary interventions targeting the microbiome represent ideal treatments for IBD. Here, I summarize the latest research on diet as a treatment for IBD from infancy to adulthood, compile evidence of the mechanisms of action behind diet as treatment, and, lastly, provide insights into future research focusing on culturally tailored diets for ethnic minority groups with increased incidence of IBD yet underrepresented in nutrition research.",Maldonado-Contreras A,2022,Infection and immunity,90,5,e0058321,10.1128/iai.00583-21,"Maldonado-Contreras, A.

31970610,Systematic Review: Non-medical Switching of Infliximab to CT-P13 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biosimilar approval, such as InflectraTM (CT-P13) for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), has reduced direct drug costs. Though clinicians are comfortable with biosimilar use in treatment-naïve patients, there are concerns in some jurisdictions that there are insufficient data from well-controlled trials to support non-medical switching. A systematic review, along with a critical assessment of the study design, was conducted to assess the potential impact of switching stable CD/UC patients from infliximab to CT-P13.
METHODS: A literature search using PubMed and abstracts/posters from 3 major gastroenterology conferences from 2014 to 2018 was completed. Two individual reviewers extracted data from each relevant report and compiled it into evidence tables to facilitate descriptive analyses. Key randomized trial and observational study designs were critically assessed to contextualize data relevance.
RESULTS: A total of 49 reports (3 randomized controlled trials, 40 observational trials, and 1 case series) were included. Most studies revealed no efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns with non-medical switch. Limitations of supporting data include a small number of randomized controlled trials; predominance of observational studies with varying outcome assessments and lack of appropriate controls; and scarcity of research on biosimilar switch long-term effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of studies suggested non-medical switch is safe. However, clinicians and regulatory bodies should be aware of differences and limitations in study designs when making inferences about the risks and benefits of switching stable IBD patients to biosimilars.",Bernard EJ; Fedorak RN; Jairath V,2020,Digestive diseases and sciences,65,8,2354-2372,10.1007/s10620-019-06036-0,"Bernard, E.

37830172,Differences in the prevalence of uveitis between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Uveitis is one of the ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is often overlooked and has been considered a sign of severe IBD. As typical subtypes of IBD, differences exist in the prevalence of uveitis between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Our study systematically assessed differences in the prevalence of uveitis between CD and UC.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. We performed a systematic review of published literature from PubMed and Embase on 30 March 2022. Two investigators independently selected studies, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. Either a fixed- or a random-effects model was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) depending on the heterogeneity of studies. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine the heterogeneity by removing article by article, while subgroup analysis was conducted in accordance with various regions.
RESULTS: Our study included data from 14 studies encompassing 115 854 participants. The prevalence of uveitis in IBD was estimated to be 2.38% (95% CI 1.60%-3.17%). The prevalence of uveitis in CD (3.27%, 95% CI 2.15%-4.39%) was significantly higher than in UC (1.60%, 95% CI 0.93%-2.27%; RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.22, p < 0.05). In subgroup analysis, a higher incidence of CD combined with uveitis was also observed in IBD patients residing in Europe (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.37-2.24).
CONCLUSIONS: Data from 115 854 IBD patients showed that CD patients were more likely to suffer from uveitis than UC patients. Ocular manifestations in IBD, particularly CD, warrant greater attention.",Lin H; Zhang J; Liang C; Wu D; Tan Y; Luo L; Liu Z,2024,Acta ophthalmologica,102,4,e485-e492,10.1111/aos.15793,"Lin, H., Zhang, J., Liang, C., Wu, D., Tan, Y., Luo, L., & Liu, Z.

35127797,Gut Microbiota Is a Potential Biomarker in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is characterized by relapse and remission alternately. It remains a great challenge to diagnose and assess disease activity during IBD due to the lack of specific markers. While traditional biomarkers from plasma and stool, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC), and S100A12, can be used to measure inflammation, they are not specific to IBD and difficult to determine an effective cut-off value. There is consensus that gut microbiota is crucial for intestinal dysbiosis is closely associated with IBD etiopathology and pathogenesis. Multiple studies have documented differences in the composition of gut microbiota between patients with IBD and healthy individuals, particularly regarding microbial diversity and relative abundance of specific bacteria. Patients with IBD have higher levels of Proteobacteria and lower amounts of Bacteroides, Eubacterium, and Faecalibacterium than healthy individuals. This review summarizes the pros and cons of using traditional and microbiota biomarkers to assess disease severity and treatment outcomes and addresses the possibility of using microbiota-focused interventions during IBD treatment. Understanding the role of microbial biomarkers in the assessment of disease activity and treatment outcomes has the potential to change clinical practice and lead to the development of more personalized therapies.",Guo X; Huang C; Xu J; Xu H; Liu L; Zhao H; Wang J; Huang W; Peng W; Chen Y; Nie Y; Zhou Y; Zhou Y,2021,Frontiers in nutrition,8,,818902,10.3389/fnut.2021.818902,"Guo, X., Huang, C., Xu, J., Xu, H., Liu, L., Zhao, H., Wang, J., Huang, W., Peng, W., Chen, Y., Nie, Y., Zhou, Y., & Zhou, Y.

38486190,Circulatory resistin levels in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic relapsing-remitting systemic disease of the gastrointestinal tract with rising incidence. Studies have shown that adipocytes play a crucial role in patients with IBD by actively participating in systemic immune responses. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation between the circulatory levels of resistin, as an adipokine, and active and remission phases of IBD in comparison with healthy controls.
METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and Scopus from inception until June 2023. Estimation of the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for comparison of plasma/serum resistin levels between IBD patients, patients in remission, and healthy controls were conducted through random-effect meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included, assessing 1836 cases. Meta-analysis indicated that generally, serum/plasma resistin levels were higher in IBD patients in comparison with healthy controls (SMD 1.33, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.08, p-value < 0.01). This was true for each of the UC and CD separate analyses, as well. Moreover, it was shown that higher serum/plasma resistin levels were detected in the active phase of IBD than in the remission phase (SMD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.42, p-value = 0.01). Finally, higher serum/plasma resistin levels were found in the remission phase compared to healthy controls (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.06, p-value < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion that circulating resistin levels are increased in IBD (both UC and CD). Also, higher resistin levels were recorded in the remission phase of IBD in comparison with healthy controls. This indicates that further studies may provide valuable insights into the role of resistin in the pathogenesis of IBD.",Behnoush AH; Maroufi SP; Reshadmanesh T; Mohtasham Kia Y; Norouzi M; Mohammadi SM; Klisic A; Khalaji A,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,107,10.1186/s12876-024-03199-7,"Behnoush, A.

38449867,Diet-derived circulating antioxidants and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a Mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the impact of circulating antioxidants on the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, our intent was to investigate the causal relationship between circulating antioxidants and IBD using Mendelian randomization (MR).
METHODS: Instrumental variables for absolute circulating antioxidants (ascorbate, retinol, lycopene, and β-carotene) and circulating antioxidant metabolites (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, ascorbate, and retinol) were screened from published studies. We obtained outcome data from two genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases, including the international inflammatory bowel disease genetics consortium (IIBDGC, 14,927 controls and 5,956 cases for Crohn's disease (CD), 20,464 controls and 6,968 cases for ulcerative colitis (UC), and 21,770 controls and 12,882 cases for IBD) and the FinnGen study (375,445 controls and 1,665 cases for CD, 371,530 controls and 5,034 cases for UC, and 369,652 controls and 7,625 cases for IBD). MR analysis was performed in each of the two databases and those results were pooled using meta-analysis to assess the overall effect of exposure on each phenotype. In order to confirm the strength of the findings, we additionally conducted a replication analysis using the UK Biobank.
RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of the IIBDGC and FinnGen, we found that each unit increase in absolute circulating level of retinol was associated with a 72% reduction in the risk of UC (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.78, P=0.015). The UC GWAS data from the UK Biobank also confirmed this causal relationship (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.00, P=0.016). In addition, there was suggestive evidence that absolute retinol level was negatively associated with IBD (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.92, P=0.031). No other causal relationship was found.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide strong evidence that the absolute circulating level of retinol is associated with a reduction in the risk of UC. Further MR studies with more instrumental variables on circulating antioxidants, especially absolute circulating antioxidants, are needed to confirm our results.",Zou M; Liang Q; Zhang W; Liang J; Zhu Y; Xu Y,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1334395,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1334395,"Zou, M., Liang, Q., Zhang, W., Liang, J., Zhu, Y., & Xu, Y.

35379216,Efficacy and safety of vedolizumab for pediatrics with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab use in pediatrics is still off-label and the data are limited. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for studies of vedolizumab in children and adolescents with IBD reporting clinical remission, response, corticosteroid-free (CS-free) remission, mucosal healing, or safety up to December 3rd 2021.
RESULTS: Ten studies, comprising 455 patients were included. For CD, the pooled clinical remission rates were 25% (19/75) at 6 weeks, 28% (25/85) at 14 weeks, 32% (17/53) at 22 weeks, and 46% (43/92) at 1 year. For UC/IBD-U, the pooled clinical remission rates were 36% (25/70) at 6 weeks, 48% (52/101) at 14 weeks, 53% (24/45) at 22 weeks, and 45% (50/112) at 1 year. Mucosal healing was found in 17%-39% of CD and 15%-34% of UC/IBD-U respectively. Six percent of patients reported serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: According to low-quality evidence based on case series, approximately one-third and one-half of patients for CD and UC/IBD-U respectively achieved remission within 22 weeks, and about half of patients achieved remission at 1 year with reasonable safety profile.

33138015,Growth and Puberty in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are gastrointestinal tract pathologies of unknown etiology; they have an alternating trend, with active and silent phases. IBD are classified in two main forms: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Both have chronic and recurrent course, gastrointestinal symptoms, and extraintestinal manifestations. The altered immune response role seems to be important both in UC and CD. In the majority of cases, CD begins with abdominal pain, diarrhea, decrease in appetite, and weight loss; there can be also perianal fistulas, rhagades, and perianal recurrent abscesses. In addition, retarded growth and delayed puberty can precede the development of the disease or can even be predominant at onset. Growth retardation is found in 40% of IBD patients, but the underlying mechanism of this and other extra-intestinal manifestations are partially known: the main hypotheses are represented by malnutrition and inflammatory response during the active phase of the disease. The increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines can influence growth, but also the onset of puberty and its progression. In addition, it could be essential to clarify the role and the possible effects of all the currently used treatments concerning growth failure and delayed puberty.",Amaro F; Chiarelli F,2020,Biomedicines,8,11,,10.3390/biomedicines8110458,"Amaro, F., & Chiarelli, F.

37247693,Terpenes: Modulating anti-inflammatory signaling in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are autoimmune diseases characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Considered a western disease, IBD incidence in newly developed countries is skyrocketing. Accordingly, global prevalence is steadily increasing. There are two major IBD phenotypes, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC manifests as uninterrupted inflammation localized in the colon and rectum. Meanwhile, CD presents as interrupted inflammation that can occur throughout the digestive tract. As a result, therapeutics have focused on anti-inflammatory approaches for its treatment. Unfortunately, only 50% of patients benefit from current Food and Drug Administration approved treatments, and all are associated with serious adverse effects. Thus, there is a need for safer and novel therapeutics to increase the efficacy in this population. One aspect that is critical in understanding IBD is how food and phytochemicals therein may be associated with modifying the pathogenesis of IBD. A variety of retrospective and prospective studies, and clinical trials have shown benefits of plant-rich diets on the prevention and symptomatic improvement of IBD. The Mediterranean diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and herbs; and characterized by the abundance of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals. An understudied phytochemical class enriched in this diet is terpenes; isoprene-based molecules are widely available in Mediterranean herbs and citrus fruits. Various terpenes have been evaluated in different IBD models. However, some present contradictory or inconclusive results. Therefore, in this review we evaluated preclinical studies of terpenes modulating basic inflammatory signaling related to IBD.",Rivera Rodríguez R; Johnson JJ,2023,Pharmacology & therapeutics,248,,108456,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2023.108456,"Rivera Rodríguez, R., & Johnson, J.

36497759,The Prevalence of Ocular Extra-Intestinal Manifestations in Adults Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a greater frequency of ocular extra-intestinal manifestations (O-EIMs) than the general population, while Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have inconsistent prevalence, according to previous studies. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of O-EIMs in CD and UC, respectively. We systemically reviewed O-EIMs and IBD across several online databases. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) observational studies examining the association between O-EIMs and IBD, such as cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies; (2) human and adult individuals; and (3) with case and control groups consisting of patients with and without O-EIMs, respectively. Patients under the age of 18 or any study on pediatric IBD will be excluded. The prevalence of uveitis in adults was determined by 21 studies comprising 190,941 individuals with IBD, including 62,874 CD and 128,067 UC. The pooled analysis revealed significantly increased odds of uveitis in patients with CD than with UC (pooled odd ratio (OR) 1.603, 95% confidence interval 1.254-2.049). The subgroup analysis revealed that European populations had significantly higher odds of developing uveitis and episcleritis in patients with CD than UC (pooled OR 1.683 and 2.401, respectively). Although O-EIMs may be the prodrome of IBD, no consistent finding was obtained as a result of the high heterogeneity from the two included studies. This meta-analysis indicates the significantly increased odds of uveitis in adults with CD than those with UC. In subgroup analysis, European with CD seemed to have higher odds of uveitis and episcleritis than those with UC. Nonetheless, the link between O-EIMs and IBD remained unclear.",Li JX; Chiang CC; Chen SN; Lin JM; Tsai YY,2022,International journal of environmental research and public health,19,23,,10.3390/ijerph192315683,"Li, J.

36913311,Effectiveness and Safety of Vedolizumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Comprehensive Meta-analysis of Observational Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many observational studies on the use of vedolizumab [VDZ] in patients with Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] have been published in the past few years. We aimed to comprehensively summarise its effectiveness and safety by pooling data only from observational studies.
METHODS: PubMed/Medline and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies on patients with CD and UC treated with VDZ through December 2021. The rates of clinical remission and overall adverse events were the primary outcomes. The rates of steroid-free clinical remission, clinical response, mucosal healing, C-reactive protein normalisation, loss of response, VDZ dose escalation, colectomy, serious adverse events, infections, and malignancies were considered as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: In all, 88 studies comprising 25 678 patients [13 663 with CD and 12 015 with UC] met the inclusion criteria. In patients with CD, the pooled estimate rates of clinical remission were 36% at induction and 39% at maintenance. In patients with UC, the pooled estimate rates of clinical remission were 40% at induction and 45% at maintenance. The pooled estimate of incidence rate of adverse events was 34.6 per 100 person-years. At multivariable meta-regression analysis, studies with increased male proportion were independently associated with higher rates of clinical remission and steroid-free clinical remission at both induction and maintenance, and clinical response at maintenance in patients with CD. Studies with increased disease duration were independently associated with higher mucosal healing rates at maintenance in patients with UC.

39308999,"Recent clinical evidence on nutrition, novel pharmacotherapy, and vaccination in inflammatory bowel diseases.","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which enclose Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic, relapsing inflammatory ailments. Their specific pathogenesis is not completely clarified, the worldwide incidence and prevalence of IBD has been steadily growing, and there is still not a definitive cure. The management of IBD has become more and more targeted, with specific immune mediators identified to be involved in its pathogenesis. Vedolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody binding specifically to the α4β7 integrin, is a gut-selective immunosuppressive biologic drug administered for both CD and UC. With the same indications as vedolizumab, ustekinumab is a fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody binding with specificity to the shared p40 protein subunit of human cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23. Several selective IL-23p19 monoclonal antibodies (risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab) have also revealed admirable efficacy and safety in IBD patients. Nutrition is a very important environmental factor associated with the onset and progression of IBD, and the Western diet is considered to contribute to the development of IBD.

36481399,The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with monoclonal antibodies in Asia.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic, systemic autoimmune diseases. As the incidence of IBD rapidly increases in Asia, increasing attention has been paid to developing additional treatment strategies. Presently, the end point of therapy is achieving clinical and endoscopic remission through the blockade of inflammatory cascades. Recent studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) use for precise molecular targeting of inflammatory pathways has a promising effect on IBD, especially moderate-to-severe CD and UC. Since the 1997 report on the use of infliximab (a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) in patients with CD, mAbs have expanded therapeutic options and have also complicated initial management options and subsequent treatment. This review comprehensively summarizes the clinical reports and studies related to the use of mAbs for the treatment of IBD in Asian countries and regions in recent years thus demonstrating the current status of mAbs use in Asia. In addition, the differences in the use of mAbs for the treatment of IBD between the Asia and the West are expounded. Ultimately, it is hoped that this review will provide new insights and a scientific basis for the clinical application of mAbs.",Chen Y; Zhang G; Yang Y; Zhang S; Jiang H; Tian K; Arenbaoligao; Chen D,2023,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,157,,114081,10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114081,"Chen, Y., Zhang, G., Yang, Y., Zhang, S., Jiang, H., Tian, K., Arenbaoligao,, & Chen, D.

33554939,Infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of all or part of the digestive tract and primarily includes Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). This review has as target to summarize the complicated correlation between IBD and infections, which can affect patients' quality of life and increase substantially morbidity and mortality rates.
RESULTS: Scientific evidence in recent years shows a growing recognition of the phenomenon although the association between these two aspects is not definitively clear. Despite the fact that our understanding of this linkage is still incomplete, it is easily deducible that infections can start whether it be the onset or the relapse of IBD. In addition to this, the course of the disease predisposes the patient to numerous infections caused by the drugs used to treat IBD and this also raises the risk of infection complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials have demonstrated that the combined use of immunomodulating agents may increase the risk of new infections. The infections might be intensified by an insufficient vaccination of adults with IBD. Physicians have to be aware of these risks and try to attenuate and treat them properly.

32250220,"Current, New and Future Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic relapsing conditions resulting from immune system activity in a genetically predisposed individual. IBD is based on progressive damage to the inflamed gut tissue. As its pathogenesis remains unknown, recent accumulating data have demonstrated that IBD is a complex and multi-factorial disorder correlated with host luminal factors, which lead to an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling. The growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for IBD has suggested a wide range of potential therapeutic targets to treat this condition. Some patients do not have a satisfactory response to current therapeutic medications such as antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, or their response decreases over time. As a result, IBD therapeutics have been changed recently, with several new agents being evaluated. The identification of various inflammatory cascades has led to forming the idea to have novel medications developed. Medications targeting Janus kinases (JAK), leukocyte trafficking Interleukin (IL) 12/23, and Sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) are among these newly developed medications and highlight the role of microbial-host interaction in inflammation as a safe promising strategy.

37781953,Vitamin D for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D possesses immunomodulatory properties and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal studies and emerging epidemiological evidence have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and worse disease activity. However, the role of vitamin D for the treatment of IBD is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for IBD.
SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was Jun 2023.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of all ages with active or inactive IBD comparing any dose of vitamin D with another dose of vitamin D, another intervention, placebo, or no intervention. We defined doses as: vitamin D (all doses), any-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 400 IU/day), high-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 1000 IU/day), low-treatment-dose vitamin D (400 IU/day to 1000 IU/day), and supplemental-dose vitamin D (less than 400 IU/day).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. clinical response for people with active disease, 2. clinical relapse for people in remission, 3. quality of life, and 4. withdrawals due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 5. disease activity at end of study, 6. normalisation of vitamin D levels at end of study, and 7. total serious adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 RCTs with 1874 participants. Study duration ranged from four to 52 weeks. Ten studies enroled people with Crohn's disease (CD), five enroled people with ulcerative colitis (UC), and seven enroled people with CD and people with UC. Seventeen studies included adults, three included children, and two included both. Four studies enroled people with active disease, six enroled people in remission, and 12 enroled both. We assessed each study for risk of bias across seven individual domains. Five studies were at low risk of bias across all seven domains. Ten studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain but with no areas of high risk of bias. Seven studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and assessors. Vitamin D (all doses) versus placebo or no treatment Thirteen studies compared vitamin D against placebo or no treatment. We could not draw any conclusions on clinical response for UC as the certainty of the evidence was very low (risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 10.57; 1 study, 60 participants). There were no data on CD. There may be fewer clinical relapses for IBD when using vitamin D compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96; 3 studies, 310 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on quality of life for IBD (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -3.10 to 2.83 (the SMD value indicates a negligent decrease in quality of life, and the corresponding CIs indicate that the effect can range from a large decrease to a large increase in quality of life); 2 studies, 243 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.27; 12 studies, 1251 participants; note 11 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 12). The certainty of the evidence was very low. High-treatment-dose vitamin D versus low-treatment-dose vitamin D Five studies compared high treatment vitamin D doses against low treatment vitamin D doses. There were no data on clinical response. There may be no difference in clinical relapse for CD (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01; 1 study, 34 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.08; 3 studies, 104 participants; note 2 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 3). The data on quality of life and disease activity could not be meta-analysed, were of very low certainty, and no conclusions could be drawn. Any-treatment-dose vitamin D versus supplemental-dose vitamin D Four studies compared treatment doses of vitamin D against supplemental doses. There were no data on clinical response and relapse. There were no data on quality of life that could be meta-analysed. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.17; 4 studies, 233 participants; note 3 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 4).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There may be fewer clinical relapses when comparing vitamin D with placebo, but we cannot draw any conclusions on differences in clinical response, quality of life, or withdrawals, due to very low-certainty evidence. When comparing high and low doses of vitamin D, there were no data for clinical response, but there may be no difference in relapse for CD. We cannot draw conclusions on the other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence. Finally, comparing vitamin D (all doses) to supplemental-dose vitamin D, there were no data on clinical relapse or response, and we could not draw conclusions on other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence or missing data. It is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research on the basis of the findings of this review. Future studies must be clear on the baseline populations, the purpose of vitamin D treatment, and, therefore, study an appropriate dosing strategy. Stakeholders in the field may wish to reach consensus on such issues prior to new studies.",Wallace C; Gordon M; Sinopoulou V; Limketkai BN,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10,10,CD011806,10.1002/14651858.CD011806.pub2,"Wallace, C., Gordon, M., Sinopoulou, V., & Limketkai, B.

33553075,Advanced Understanding of Monogenic Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic disorders that cause relapsing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and comprise three major subgroups of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD-unclassified (IBDU). Recent advances in genomic technologies have furthered our understanding of IBD pathogenesis. It includes differentiation rare monogenic disorders exhibiting IBD and IBD-like inflammation (monogenic IBD) from patients with the common polygenic form of IBD. Several novel genes responsible for monogenic IBD have been elucidated, and the number of reports has increased due to advancements in molecular functional analysis. Identification of these pathogenic genetic mutations has helped in elucidating the details of the immune response associated with gastrointestinal inflammation and in providing individualized treatments for patients with severe IBD that is often unresponsive to conventional therapy. The majority of monogenic IBD studies have focused on young children diagnosed <6 years of age (very early-onset IBD); however, a recent study revealed high prevalence of monogenic IBD in older children aged >6 years of age as well. Meanwhile, although patients with monogenic IBD generally show co-morbidities and/or extraintestinal manifestation at the time of diagnosis, cases of IBD developing as the initial symptom with unremarkable prodromal symptoms have been reported. It is crucial that the physicians properly match genetic analytical data with clinical diagnosis and/or differential diagnosis. In this review, we summarize the essential clues that may physicians make a correct diagnosis of monogenic disease, including classification, prevalence and clinical phenotype based on available literatures.",Nambu R; Muise AM,2020,Frontiers in pediatrics,8,,618918,10.3389/fped.2020.618918,"Nambu, R., & Muise, A.

35177326,Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes as regulators of colitis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the pathophysiology of IBD is multifaceted, ubiquitination, a post-translational modification, has been shown to have essential roles in its pathogenesis and development. Ubiquitin-modifying enzymes (UMEs) work in synergy to orchestrate the optimal ubiquitination of target proteins, thereby maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple UME genes as IBD susceptibility loci, implying the importance of UMEs in IBD. Furthermore, accumulative evidence demonstrates that UMEs affect intestinal inflammation by regulating various aspects, such as intestinal barrier functions and immune responses. Considering the significant functions of UMEs in IBD, targeting UMEs could become a favorable therapeutic approach for IBD.",Ruan J; Schlüter D; Naumann M; Waisman A; Wang X,2022,Trends in molecular medicine,28,4,304-318,10.1016/j.molmed.2022.01.006,"Ruan, J., Schlüter, D., Naumann, M., Waisman, A., & Wang, X.

39348571,Association Between Vedolizumab Treatment and Arthritis/Arthralgia in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vedolizumab is a humanized gut selective drug that targets α4β7 integrin and has been used successfully in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Pivotal studies have already demonstrated the drug's safety, but some real-life cohorts have shown an increase in arthralgia and arthritis in patients using vedolizumab. These findings raised the question of whether these joint symptoms are extraintestinal manifestations of IBD (since the drug acts only in the gut) or if they are associated with the use of vedolizumab. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the incidence of arthralgia/arthritis in patients receiving vedolizumab and to investigate whether these events are indeed drug related.
METHODS: Pubmed, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched for randomized clinical trials reporting the incidence of joint manifestations in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) who were treated with vedolizumab. The considered outcomes were arthritis and arthralgia. We used RevMan to calculate the pooled incidence of the reported outcomes and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 4,206 articles. After removal of duplicates and screening of results, 6 randomized studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 3,134 patients with moderately to severe IBD were included. Of those, 2,119 were randomized to receive vedolizumab and 1,015 to placebo. In the intervention group, 210 patients developed arthritis or arthralgia of any kind while 84 patients developed those symptoms in the placebo group (RR=1.09; 95%CI: 0.86-1.38; p=0.49, I2=0%), showing no significant association. Results also showed no significant association between exposure and the studied outcome after comparing CD (RR=1.02; 95%CI: 0.76-1.37, p=0.89, I2=0%) and UC (RR=1.24; 95%CI: 0.81-1.89, p=0.32, I2=43%) separately.
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed no association of these symptoms to the treatment with vedolizumab. Therefore, the new onset of worsening arthritis and arthralgia may be associated with the course of the disease itself, with the body's response to the drugs or with the exclusion of corticosteroids or anti-TNF from concomitant treatment with vedolizumab. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required, especially randomized clinical trials comparing anti-TNF, corticosteroid and immunomodulators to evaluate the incidence of joint manifestations in patients with IBD and even other rheumatological manifestations that may be associated as well.",Alves Halpern G; Gomes C; Thaytala Quintino Falcon B; Prigol Dalfovo M; De Carvalho Maia J; Brandão Oliveira D,2024,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,33,3,379-385,10.15403/jgld-5546,"Alves Halpern, G., Gomes, C., Thaytala Quintino Falcon, B., Prigol Dalfovo, M., De Carvalho Maia, J., & Brandão Oliveira, D.

Data were synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis as cumulative risk of events at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, and compared with data from patients with AO IBD in the same cohorts.
RESULTS: We identified 9 studies, comprising 14,765 patients with EO IBD. In patients with EO Crohn's disease (CD), the cumulative 5-year risk of surgery was 22.6% (95% CI, 18.7-27.2) and was similar to that of patients with AO CD (relative risk [RR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.80-1.34). Overall exposure to corticosteroids was comparable between patients with EO CD vs AO CD (5-year risk: 55.4%; 95% CI, 53.4-57.4; RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-1.00), but exposure to immunomodulators (31.5%; 95% CI, 29.7-33.4; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.77) or biologic agents (6.5%; 95% CI, 5.6-7.6; RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.52) was significantly lower for patients with EO CD than for patients with AO CD. Similarly, in patients with EO ulcerative colitis (UC), the cumulative 5-year risk of surgery was 7.8% (95% CI, 5.0-12.0), similar to the risk for patients with AO UC (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79-2.11). Overall exposure to corticosteroids was comparable between patients with EO UC vs AO UC (5-year risk: 57.2%; 95% CI, 55.6-58.7; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06), but exposure to immunomodulators (16.1%; 95% CI, 15.0-17.2; RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.54-0.62) or biologic agents (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.6-2.5; RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.52) was significantly lower for patients with EO UC than for patients with AO UC. Patients with EO IBD appeared to have increased mortality, but not malignancy, compared with the general population. There were few data on comorbidities or adverse effects of medications.
CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that patients with EO IBD have a similar risk of surgery as patients with AO IBD. However, patients with EO IBD are less likely to receive treatment with immunomodulators or biologic agents.",Rozich JJ; Dulai PS; Fumery M; Sandborn WJ; Singh S,2020,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,18,11,2437-2447.e6,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.02.048,"Rozich, J.

32585338,Targeting T cells in inflammatory bowel disease.,"T cells play a pivotal role in the immune response underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. On this basis, over the past 25 years several drugs have assessed to target T cells in IBD patients. Amongst anti-CD3 antibodies, visilizumab and foralumab did not show clinical efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients, respectively, whereas otelixizumab has been tested in vitro only. The anti-CD4 BF-5 and cM-T412, and the anti-CD25 basiliximab and daclizumab were not effective in CD and UC patients, respectively. The anti-NKG2D antibody NNC0142-0002 showed clinical benefit in CD patients, in particular in biologic naïve ones, in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The anti-CD40L M90 and the GSK1349571A blocking calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are involved in the T cell activation and proliferation, were tested only in ex vivo/in vitro experiments. Apart from ustekinumab, all the other drugs targeting T cell-derived cytokines failed. The reinduction of lamina propria T cell apoptosis is a mechanism to modulate T cell survival exploited by cyclosporin A, azathioprine and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents, such as infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab. In this article, we review the drugs targeting T cells via surface receptors, via T cell-derived cytokines, via CRAC channels or by inducing apoptosis.",Giuffrida P; Di Sabatino A,2020,Pharmacological research,159,,105040,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105040,"Giuffrida, P., & Di Sabatino, A.

37724090,Cytomegalovirus Pneumonia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Literature Review and Clinical Recommendations.,"AIM: The objective was to elucidate the correlation between CMVP and immunosuppressive therapy in IBD patients, we hope this review could expand on the significance of CMV as an opportunistic pathogen and the potential impact on morbidity and mortality in IBD patients.
METHODS: Records and clinical trajectories linked to CMVP in IBD patients were extracted from the PubMed database, irrespective of language barriers. The reference lists incorporated in these studies were manually inspected. Conclusions were generated using straightforward descriptive analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 18 IBD patients, including Crohn's disease (CD, 67%) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC, 33%), affected by CMVP were identified from 17 published articles. A minority of these patients (17%) exhibited active disease, whereas the majority (83%) presented with quiescent disease. Fever (100%) and dyspnea (44%) emerged as the most prevalent clinical symptoms. All the patients had undergone immunosuppressive therapy. A significant proportion, up to 89%, had received thiopurine treatment prior to the CMVP diagnosis. Interestingly, none of the patients were subjected to biological therapy. Half of the patients manifested with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Almost all patients (94%) were administered antiviral treatment and a substantial 83% experienced full recovery. Immunosuppressive agents were either tapered or discontinued altogether. A subset of patients, 17%, suffered fatal outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the need for heightened suspicion of CMVP in IBD patients who exhibit symptoms such as fever and dyspnea. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CMVP should be considered a potential differential diagnosis. It was observed that CMVP primarily transpires during CD remission. Azathioprine emerged as the predominant immunosuppressant linked to CMV reactivation. The prompt application of effective antiviral therapy can substantially enhance patient outcomes. CMV vaccine might serve as a viable prevention strategy.",Ren K; Yong C; Wang Y; Wei H; Zhao K; He B; Cui M; Chen Y; Wang J,2023,Infection and drug resistance,16,,6195-6208,10.2147/IDR.S420244,"Ren, K., Yong, C., Wang, Y., Wei, H., Zhao, K., He, B., Cui, M., Chen, Y., & Wang, J.

34575326,Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Sarcopenia: Its Mechanism and Clinical Importance.,"Malnutrition is a major contributor to muscle loss and muscle dysfunction, known as sarcopenia. Malnutrition is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The number of patients with IBD has recently been increasing. More severe malnutrition is often seen in CD compared to UC, probably due to CD affecting the main site of nutrient absorption, extensive mucosal lesions, fistulas, short bowel syndrome after resection, or obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. A recent meta-analysis showed the high prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with IBD, and thus sarcopenia is a very important problem for IBD. Although IBD is more common in younger patients, sarcopenia can develop through a variety of mechanisms, including malnutrition, chronic inflammation, increased inflammatory status in adipose tissue, vitamin deficiency, and imbalance of the muscle-gut axis. In addition, sarcopenia has a negative impact on postoperative complications and hospital stay in patients with IBD. Appropriate intervention for sarcopenia may be important, in addition to clinical remission and endoscopic mucosal healing in patients with IBD. Much more attention will thus be paid to sarcopenia in patients with IBD. In this review, we outline IBD and sarcopenia, based on the current evidence.",Nishikawa H; Nakamura S; Miyazaki T; Kakimoto K; Fukunishi S; Asai A; Nishiguchi S; Higuchi K,2021,Journal of clinical medicine,10,18,,10.3390/jcm10184214,"Nishikawa, H., Nakamura, S., Miyazaki, T., Kakimoto, K., Fukunishi, S., Asai, A., Nishiguchi, S., & Higuchi, K.

36043901,Proteomic and lipidomic biomarkers in the diagnosis and progression of inflammatory bowel disease - a review.,"PURPOSE: There is an increasing prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to date, no effective treatment has been developed and the exact etiology of this disease remains unknown. Nevertheless, a growing number of proteomic and lipidomic studies have identified certain proteins and lipids which can be used successfully in patients to improve diagnoses and monitoring of treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have focused on the applications of proteins and lipids for IBD diagnostics, including differentiation of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), treatment monitoring, monitoring of clinical state, likelihood of relapse, and their potential for novel targeted treatments.
RESULTS: Analysis of protein and lipid profiles can: improve the availability and use of diagnostic markers; improve understanding of the pathomechanisms of IBD, for example, several studies have implicated platelet dysfunction (PF4), autoimmune responses (granzyme B, perforin), and abnormal metabolism (arachidonic acid pathways); aid in monitoring patient health; and improve therapeutics (experimental phosphatidylcholine therapy has been shown to result in an improvement in intestinal condition).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the enormous progress of proteomics and lipidomics in recent years and the development of new technologies, further research is needed to select some of the most sensitive and specific markers applicable in diagnosing and treating IBD.",Cecerska-Heryć E; Ronkowski B; Heryć R; Serwin N; Grygorcewicz B; Roszak M; Galant K; Dołęgowska B,2023,Proteomics.

36150392,The diagnostic yield of pan-enteric capsule endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic modality enabling real time video imaging of the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa. Pan-enteric capsule endoscopy (PCE) is now able to thoroughly assess the entire GI tract, including for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PCEs in IBD.
METHODS: We comprehensively searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of PCE with endoscopic evaluation, intestinal ultrasound or magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). Data were analyzed by calculating forest plots and the use of the I2 statistic for heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified, with seven studies evaluating PCE diagnostic yield in Crohn's disease (CD) and seven studies in ulcerative colitis (UC). In CD, there was a trend to superiority of PCE over MRE and colonoscopy with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.85-1.86%) for the detection of CD. This translates to an increased diagnostic yield of 5% and 7% for PCE compared with MRE and colonoscopy, respectively. PCEs had a diagnostic sensitivity for the detection of UC of 93.8% (95% CI, 87.6-97.0%) and a specificity of 69.8% (95% CI, 38.2-89.6%).
CONCLUSION: PCEs have a comparable diagnostic yield to colonoscopy and MRE in Crohn's disease. The major difficulty remains standardization of PCE scoring systems and the lack of transmural assessment. In UC, PCE has an excellent diagnostic sensitivity and positive predictive value, but there are limitations to its use including the lack of histologic assessment and poor specificity.",Tamilarasan AG; Tran Y; Paramsothy S; Leong R,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,12,2207-2216,10.1111/jgh.16007,"Tamilarasan, A.

32541691,Which long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs contribute to inflammatory bowel disease?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic relapsing gastrointestinal inflammatory disease, mainly comprises ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Although the mechanisms and pathways of IBD have been widely examined in recent decades, its exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Studies have focused on the discovery of new therapeutic targets and application of precision medicine. Recently, a strong connection between IBD and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) has been reported. ncRNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). The contributions of lncRNAs and circRNAs in IBD are less well-studied compared with those of miRNAs. However, lncRNAs and circRNAs are likely to drive personalized therapy for IBD. They will enable accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic responses and promote IBD therapy. Herein, we briefly describe the molecular functions of lncRNAs and circRNAs and provide an overview of the current knowledge of the altered expression profiles of lncRNAs and circRNAs in patients with IBD. Further, we discuss how these RNAs are involved in the nosogenesis of IBD and are emerging as biomarkers.",Lin L; Zhou G; Chen P; Wang Y; Han J; Chen M; He Y; Zhang S,2020,Cell death & disease,11,6,456,10.1038/s41419-020-2657-z,"Lin, L., Zhou, G., Chen, P., Wang, Y., Han, J., Chen, M., He, Y., & Zhang, S.

33330572,Gut Microbiota and Metabolic Specificity in Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease.,"Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents multifactorial chronic inflammatory conditions in the gastrointestinal tract and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite similarities in pathobiology and disease symptoms, UC and CD represent distinct diseases and exhibit diverse therapeutic responses. While studies have now confirmed that IBD is associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, specific changes in the gut microbiome and associated metabolic effects on the host due to CD and UC are less well-understood. Methods: To address this knowledge gap, we performed an extensive unbiased meta-analysis of the gut microbiome data from five different IBD patient cohorts from five different countries using QIIME2, DIAMOND, and STAMP bioinformatics platforms. In-silico profiling of the metabolic pathways and community metabolic modeling were carried out to identify disease-specific association of the metabolic fluxes and signaling pathways. Results: Our results demonstrated a highly conserved gut microbiota community between healthy individuals and IBD patients at higher phylogenetic levels. However, at or below the order level in the taxonomic rank, we found significant disease-specific alterations. Similarly, we identified differential enrichment of the metabolic pathways in CD and UC, which included enriched pathways related to amino acid and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, in addition to other metabolic pathways. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study highlights the prospects of harnessing the gut microbiota to improve understanding of the etiology of CD and UC and to develop novel prognostic, and therapeutic approaches.",Sankarasubramanian J; Ahmad R; Avuthu N; Singh AB; Guda C,2020,Frontiers in medicine,7,,606298,10.3389/fmed.2020.606298,"Sankarasubramanian, J., Ahmad, R., Avuthu, N., Singh, A.

39521601,BRD4 as an emerging epigenetic therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, mainly comprising two subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). IBD, featured by recurrent symptoms and significant morbidity, poses a significant threat to global health and has an adverse impact on quality of life. Currently, there is no curative therapy for IBD, and the available medications are only for managing the disease condition, likely owing to the insufficient understanding of the underlying pathophysiology processes involved in IBD, and the lack of safe and effective medicines. Thus, novel targeted therapies for IBD are urgently needed for better efficacy with an improved adverse event profile. As the most extensively studied member of bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family proteins, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is emerging as a promising epigenetic therapeutic target for IBD. Pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 with selective small molecule inhibitors shows potent anti-inflammatory effects in both in vitro and different IBD mouse models. Herein, we summarize current knowledge in understanding the role of BRD4 in the pathogenesis and development of IBD, and the clinical landscape of developing BET/BRD4 inhibitors and emerging BRD4-targeted degraders as promising therapeutical alternatives. Challenges and opportunities, as well as future directions in drug discovery by targeting BRD4 are also briefly discussed.",Ma Z; Bolinger AA; Pinchuk IV; Tian B; Zhou J,2024,"Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",101,,203-236,10.1016/bs.apha.2024.10.008,"Ma, Z., Bolinger, A.

36446558,Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pregnancy: Is It a Marker for Adverse Outcomes?,"OBJECTIVE: To assess obstetric/puerperal/neonatal outcomes in an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population and to analyze disease characteristics that may be associated to adverse outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective descriptive analysis including 47 pregnant women with IBD (28 with Crohn's disease - CD and 19 with ulcerative colitis - UC) who delivered between March 2012 and July 2018 in a tertiary hospital. We reviewed clinical records to extract demographic information, previous medical history, disease subtype, activity, severity, treatment, and obstetric, puerperal, and neonatal outcome measures.
RESULTS: Obstetric and neonatal complications (composite outcomes) occurred in 55.3% and 14.6% of the IBD population, respectively, and were more frequent in UC patients. Preterm birth (PTB), preeclampsia, anemia, low birth weight (LBW), and neonatal death were also more frequent in UC patients. The rate of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was 14.9%, and it was higher in CD patients. Women with active IBD had more obstetric/neonatal adverse outcomes (fetal growth restriction and LBW in particular) and cesarean sections. Patients with medicated IBD had less obstetric/neonatal complications (PTB and LBW in specific) and cesarean sections but more PPH.
CONCLUSION: Women with IBD may have an increased risk of obstetric/puerperal/neonatal adverse outcomes. Ulcerative colitis patients had more obstetric and neonatal complications, whereas PPH was more frequent if CD patients. Other disease characteristics were considered, which allowed a better understanding of their possible influence.

40000943,Risk of stroke in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Current studies suggest a potential link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke. This study aimed to assess the risk of stroke in IBD patients compared to general population.
METHODS: Systematic search was done in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and CINAHL databases for studies published till September 2023. Using a random-effects model, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stroke occurrence were calculated. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate pooled HR with 95%CI for CD, UC, and overall IBD cases separately. Publication bias assessment was done by Begg's and Egger's tests.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 2,802,955 participants were included. IBD patients in general had significantly higher risk of stroke, with HR of 1.30 [95% CI 1.21-1.39]. Subgroup analysis demonstrated an HR of 1.35 [95% CI 1.22-1.49] for CD and 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.22] for UC. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across studies, with no substantial publication bias. Sensitivity analyses affirmed the stability of findings.
CONCLUSION: IBD in general, and Crohn's disease in particular are associated with significantly higher risk of stroke. Our findings further emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and management strategies in IBD care.

32994694,Systematic review of the prevalence and development of osteoporosis or low bone mineral density and its risk factors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic, immune-mediated disorders of the digestive tract. IBD is considered to be a risk factor for developing osteoporosis; however current literature on this matter is inconsistent.
AIM: To assess prevalence and development of osteoporosis and low bone mineral density (BMD), and its risk factors, in IBD patients.
METHODS: Systematic review of population-based studies. Studies were identified by electronic (January 2018) and manual searches (May 2018). Databases searched included EMBASE and PubMed and abstracts from 2014-2018 presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation congress, and Digestive Disease Week were screened. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated either the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia and/or risk factors for osteoporosis or low BMD in IBD patients. Studies on children under the age of 18 were excluded. Only population-based studies were included. All risk factors for osteoporosis and low BMD investigated in any included article were considered. Study quality and the possibility of bias were analysed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Twelve studies including 3661 IBD patients and 12789 healthy controls were included. Prevalence of osteoporosis varied between 4%-9% in studies including both CD and UC patients; 2%-9% in studies including UC patients, and 7%-15% in studies including CD patients. Among healthy controls, prevalence of osteoporosis was 3% and 10% in two studies. CD diagnosis, lower body mass index (BMI), and lower body weight were risk factors associated with osteoporosis or low BMD. Findings regarding gender showed inconsistent results. CD patients had an increased risk for osteoporosis or low BMD over time, while UC patients did not. Increased age was associated with decreased BMD, and there was a positive association between weight and BMI and BMD over time. Great heterogeneity was found in the included studies in terms of study methodologies, definitions and the assessment of osteoporosis, and only a small number of population-based studies was available.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review found a possible increase of prevalence of osteoporosis in CD cohorts when compared to UC and cohorts including both disease types. Lower weight and lower BMI were predictors of osteoporosis or low BMD in IBD patients. The results varied considerably between studies.",Kärnsund S; Lo B; Bendtsen F; Holm J; Burisch J,2020,World journal of gastroenterology,26,35,5362-5374,10.3748/wjg.v26.i35.5362,"Kärnsund, S., Lo, B., Bendtsen, F., Holm, J., & Burisch, J.

39448963,Risk of Clostridioides difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients undergoing vedolizumab treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing condition wherein biologics have improved disease prognosis but introduced elevated infection susceptibility. Vedolizumab (VDZ) demonstrates unique safety advantages; however, a comprehensive systematic comparison regarding the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) between vedolizumab and alternative medications remains absent.
METHOD: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov registry were comprehensively searched. Pooled estimates of CDI proportion, incidence, pooled risk ratio between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), vedolizumab and other medications were calculated. Data synthesis was completed in R using the package ""meta"".
RESULTS: Of the 338 studies initially identified, 30 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. For CDI risk, the pooled proportion was 0.013 (95% CI 0.010-0.017), as well as the pooled proportion of serious CDI was 0.004 (95% CI 0.002-0.008). The comparative pooled risk ratios revealed: UC versus CD at 2.25 (95% CI 1.73-2.92), vedolizumab versus anti-TNF agents at 0.15 (95% CI 0.04-0.63) for UC and 1.29 (95% CI 0.41-4.04) for CD.
CONCLUSION: The overall CDI risk in IBD patients exposed to vedolizumab was estimated to be 0.013. An increased risk of CDI was noted in UC patients receiving vedolizumab compared to those with CD. Vedolizumab potentially offers an advantage over anti-TNF agents for UC regarding CDI risk, but not for CD.

32552882,The risk of rheumatoid arthritis among patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the available data on this association are inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between IBD and the risk of RA.
METHODS: Observational studies investigating the RA risk among patients with IBD (Crohn disease (CD) and/or ulcerative colitis (UC)) were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from the date of inception to December 2019. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CIs) were pooled with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics while publication bias was determined using Begg's and Egger's tests. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: A total of three cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two case-control studies were included in the meta-analyses. Compared to the non-IBD control or general population, there was a significantly higher risk of RA among patients with IBD (RR = 2.59; 95% CI: 1.93-3.48). Moreover, both CD (RR = 3.14; 95% CI: 2.46-4.01) and UC (RR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.76-2.97) were associated with a significantly increased risk of RA. However, heterogeneity was substantial across studies and the subgroup analyses failed to identify the potential source of heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD have a greater risk of developing RA. Rheumatologists should be consulted when patients with IBD present with undifferentiated joint complaints. However, more prospective cohort studies are needed to validate these results.",Chen Y; Chen L; Xing C; Deng G; Zeng F; Xie T; Gu L; Yang H,2020,BMC gastroenterology,20,1,192,10.1186/s12876-020-01339-3,"Chen, Y., Chen, L., Xing, C., Deng, G., Zeng, F., Xie, T., Gu, L., & Yang, H.

33814999,Training for Minimally Invasive Surgery for IBD: A Current Need.,"Surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) management has passed through an important evolution over the last decades, with innovative strategies and new technologies, especially in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches. MIS procedures for IBD include multiport laparoscopy, single-port surgery, robotics, and the use of transanal platforms. These approaches can be used in the surgical management of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There are significant peculiarities in the surgical field in CD and UC, and their perfect understanding are directly related to better outcomes in IBD patients, as a consequence of improvement in knowledge by IBD surgeons. Different strategies to train colorectal surgeons were developed worldwide, for better application of MIS, usually for malignant or non-IBD benign diseases. There is a significant lack of evidence in specific training strategies for MIS in the IBD field. In this review, the authors outline the importance of adequate surgical training in IBD MIS, by discussing the current evidence on different approaches and emphasizing the need for better training protocols included in multidisciplinary teams in IBD centers throughout the globe.",Kotze PG; Holubar SD; Lipman JM; Spinelli A,2021,Clinics in colon and rectal surgery,34,3,172-180,10.1055/s-0040-1718685,"Kotze, P.

37682136,The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and inflammatory bowel disease in children: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Available literature has reported the association of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults. However, only a few studies have addressed the disease in children.
AIM: To ascertain the correlation of H pylori infection with IBD among children.
METHODS: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. We searched databases including Cochrane, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science to select relevant studies. Ultimately, based on predetermined inclusion criteria, we included 6 studies that met the requirements. Review Manager and Stata software were used to extract and analyze the data from the relevant studies. In the methods, we employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches for comprehensive analysis. Qualitative analysis involved describing study designs, sample characteristics, and results, while quantitative analysis involved statistical tests such as calculating pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the association between H pylori infection and IBD in children. Lastly, by combining the results of the individual studies, our objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between H pylori infection and IBD in children.
RESULTS: In totality, we involved 2236 participants that were recruited in 6 studies. We detected no significant difference in H pylori prevalence (9.8% vs 12.7%, P = .12) by comparing the children IBD group to controls. Among the IBD children, we estimated odds ratio (OR) of H pylori infection to 0.62 [(95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.34-1.12)]. In children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), the H pylori infection rates were higher than in those with IBD-unclassified (IBDU).When analyzed stratified by disease of study design, In CD group [OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.72-2.80)] (I2 = 0%, P = .64). but no significant difference in CD group.

36648528,Dietary advice for patients with bowel-related conditions and malabsorption.,"PURPOSE: To explain the pathophysiology of kidney stone formation and appropriate dietary recommendations in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and after bariatric surgery, focusing on the current literature.
METHODS: A narrative review methodology was performed. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Studies on the relationship between IBD or bariatric surgery and the risk of kidney stone formation were included.
RESULTS: Dietary composition has a critical role in urinary stone formation. Nutritional factors such as fluid intake, dietary protein, carbohydrates, oxalate, and calcium contribute to the risk of stone formation. Bowel-related malabsorptive conditions (IBD, after bariatric surgery, etc.) are associated with an increased risk of kidney stone formation due to metabolic and physiological changes such as hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and decreased fluid intake or absorption. While the risk is lower in restrictive bariatric surgeries, the risk of kidney stone formation increases, especially after malabsorptive procedures. Dietary recommendations for these patients could profit alleviate urinary changes and reduce the risk of kidney stones.
CONCLUSION: Bowel-related malabsorptive conditions such as IBD and bariatric surgery are associated with an increased risk of kidney stones. Appropriate dietary recommendations can improve urinary metabolic changes and reduce kidney stone formation and the possibility of stone-related surgery.",İbis MA; Oktar A; Gokce MI,2023,World journal of urology,41,5,1235-1242,10.1007/s00345-023-04281-7,"İbis, M.

38021365,Therapeutic advancement in inflammatory bowel disease by incorporating plant-based diet.,"Identification and recognition of the ubiquitous environmental factor are prerequisite for treatment and prevention of the disease. The biggest problem with current practice in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor for the disease. The incidence of IBD is associated with dietary transition from a traditional diet to the current (westernized) diet. Prospective cohort studies and case-control studies indicate that the current diet is a risk factor for IBD. The current diet tends to cause gut microbial dysbiosis resulting in a pro-inflammatory state. Therefore, we regard our current diet as this factor. Even nutritionally balanced meals are unable to suppress relapse, particularly in Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore, we developed a plant-based diet (PBD) (lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet) to counter the current diet. By incorporating the PBD into practice, we achieved far better outcomes in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD in both the induction and quiescent phases compared to the current standard therapy. All patients were treated on an inpatient basis and provided with a PBD. CD is far more untenable than UC and is destined to follow a disabling course. Therefore, infliximab was indicated in all patients with CD, but only in severe cases with UC. This infliximab and PBD as first-line (IPF) therapy broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics (around 30%): the remission rate was 96% (44/46) in CD and 76% (13/17) in severe UC. A PBD can induce remission without medication in approximately one-third of mild cases of UC. All patients were advised to adhere PBD after discharge. In CD, a relapse-free outcome was achieved in nearly a half of patients (52%) at 10-year follow-up without biologics or immunosuppressants. Cumulative relapse rates for 51 initial episode cases of UC (18 mild, 30 moderate, 3 severe) at 1 and 5 years were 14% and 27%, respectively. We believe our assertion that the current diet is the ubiquitous environmental factor underlying IBD is correct and a PBD is right diet for the disease.",Chiba M; Tsuji T; Komatsu M,2023,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,8,,38,10.21037/tgh-23-6,"Chiba, M., Tsuji, T., & Komatsu, M.

39927188,Do Antibiotics Cause Inflammatory Bowel Disease? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), exhibits a multifactorial pathogenesis influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Antibiotic usage has been implicated in modifying the gut microbiome, potentially leading to dysbiosis and contributing to IBD risk. Despite existing literature, the relationship remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between prior antibiotic use and the onset of IBD.
METHODS: A systematic literature search in PubMed was conducted to identify studies exploring the link between antibiotic use and subsequent IBD diagnosis. Studies reporting CD, UC, or both as primary outcomes were included. The meta-analysis, performed according to PRISMA guidelines, summarized risk estimates, represented as odds ratios (ORs), and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses involved the categorization of antibiotics and the determination of the minimum number of antibiotic therapy courses administered.
RESULTS: Out of 722 publications, 31 studies comprising 102,103 individuals met eligibility criteria. The pooled OR for IBD in those with prior antibiotic exposure was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.25-1.56). Antibiotic use was associated with an increased risk of IBD (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19-1.94). Notably, this association was confined to CD (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.27-1.77), while no significant association was observed with UC (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.00-1.47). Risk augmentation for IBD correlated positively with the number of antibiotic courses (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.12).
CONCLUSION: Previous antibiotic use is associated with the later development of CD. A positive dose-response effect was also observed. Against this background, antibiotics should be used rationally.",Scharf E; Schlattmann P; Stallhofer J; Stallmach A,2025,Visceral medicine,41,1,32-47,10.1159/000541601,"Scharf, E., Schlattmann, P., Stallhofer, J., & Stallmach, A.

36295058,Genetic Aspects of Micronutrients Important for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex diseases whose etiology is associated with genetic and environmental risk factors, among which are diet and gut microbiota. To date, IBD is an incurable disease and the main goal of its treatment is to reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and improve nutritional status and the quality of life. Patients with IBD usually suffer from nutritional deficiency with imbalances of specific micronutrient levels that contribute to the further deterioration of the disease. Therefore, along with medications usually used for IBD treatment, therapeutic strategies also include the supplementation of micronutrients such as vitamin D, folic acid, iron, and zinc. Micronutrient supplementation tailored according to individual needs could help patients to maintain overall health, avoid the triggering of symptoms, and support remission. The identification of individuals' genotypes associated with the absorption, transport and metabolism of micronutrients can modify future clinical practice in IBD and enable individualized treatment. This review discusses the personalized approach with respect to genetics related to micronutrients commonly used in inflammatory bowel disease treatment.",Dragasevic S; Stankovic B; Kotur N; Milutinovic AS; Milovanovic T; Stojkovic Lalosevic M; Stojanovic M; Pavlovic S; Popovic D,2022,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",12,10,,10.3390/life12101623,"Dragasevic, S., Stankovic, B., Kotur, N., Milutinovic, A.

33666710,Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease and its Relationship with the Microbiome.,"Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract, comprising of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and, where classification is undetermined, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU). Paediatric IBD incidence is increasing globally, with prevalence highest in the developed world. Though no specific causative agent has been identified for paediatric IBD, it is believed that a number of factors may contribute to the development of the disease, including genetics and the environment. Another potential component in the development of IBD is the microbiota in the digestive tract, particularly the gut. While the exact role that the microbiome plays in IBD is unclear, many studies acknowledge the complex relationship between the gut bacteria and pathogenesis of IBD. In this review, we look at the increasing number of studies investigating the role the microbiome and other biomes play in paediatric patients with IBD, particularly changes associated with IBD, varying disease states, and therapeutics. The paediatric IBD microbiome is significantly different to that of healthy children, with decreased diversity and differences in bacterial composition (such as a decrease in Firmicutes). Changes in the microbiome relating to various treatments of IBD and disease severity have also been observed in multiple studies. Changes in diversity and composition may also extend to other biomes in paediatric IBD, such as the virome and the mycobiome. Research into biome differences in IBD paediatric patients may help progress our understanding of the aetiology of the disease.",Fitzgerald RS; Sanderson IR; Claesson MJ,2021,Microbial ecology,82,4,833-844,10.1007/s00248-021-01697-9,"Fitzgerald, R.

31252191,Progression of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is increasing in Latin America. We performed a systematic review to identify clinical and epidemiologic features of IBD in Latin America (including Mexico, Central America, and South America) and the Caribbean.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SciELO databases for clinical or epidemiologic studies of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) from Latin American and Caribbean countries and territories that reported incidence, prevalence, ratio of UC:CD, IBD phenotype, and treatment, through September 12, 2018. Data were extracted from 61 articles for analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence and prevalence of IBD have been steadily increasing in Latin America and the Caribbean. The incidence of CD in Brazil increased from 0.08 per 100,000 person-years in 1988 to 0.68 per 100,000 person-years in 1991-1995 to 5.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2015. The highest reported prevalence of IBD was in Argentina, in 2007, at 15 and 82 per 100,000 person-years for CD and UC, respectively. The ratio of UC:CD exceeded 1 in all regions throughout Latin America and the Caribbean with the exception of Brazil. Treatment with tumor necrosis factor antagonists increased steadily for patients with CD (43.4% of all patients in Brazil were treated in 2014) but less so for patients with UC (4.5% of all patients were treated in 2014). Surgery for IBD decreased with time. In Chile, surgeries were performed on 57.0% of patients with CD and 18.0% of patients with UC during the period of 1990-2002; these values decreased to 38.0% and 5.0%, respectively, during the period of 2012-2015. In Peru, 6.9% of patients with UC received colectomies in the period of 2001-2003 and 6.2% in 2004-2014.
CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review, we found the incidence of IBD to be increasing throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Population-based epidemiology studies are needed to evaluate the increase in IBD in these regions, which differ from other global regions in climate, culture, demographics, diet, healthcare delivery and infrastructure, and socioeconomic status.",Kotze PG; Underwood FE; Damião AOMC; Ferraz JGP; Saad-Hossne R; Toro M; Iade B; Bosques-Padilla F; Teixeira FV; Juliao-Banos F; Simian D; Ghosh S; Panaccione R; Ng SC; Kaplan GG,2020,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,18,2,304-312,10.1016/j.cgh.2019.06.030,"Kotze, P.

35581968,Risk of venous thromboembolism in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A two- to three-fold increased risk of venous thrombotic events (VTE) has been demonstrated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to the general population, but less is known about the risk of VTE in child- and pediatric-onset IBD. In recent years, several studies have reported the rising incidence rate of VTE in juvenile patients with IBD, and the related risk factors have been explored.
AIM: To evaluate the risk of VTE in children and adolescents with IBD.
METHODS: Articles published up to April 2021 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SinoMed, CNKI, and WANFANG. Data from observational studies and clinical work were extracted. The outcome was the occurrence of VTE according to the type of IBD. The available odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted to compare the outcomes. Effect size (P), odds ratio (OR), and 95%CI were used to assess the association between VTE risk and IBD disease. Subgroup analyses stratified by subtypes of VTE and IBD were performed.
RESULTS: Twelve studies (7450272 IBD patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Child and adolescent IBD patients showed increased VTE risk (P = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.01-0.03). Subgroup analyses stratified by IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC): P = 0.05, 95%CI: 0.03-0.06; Crohn's disease (CD): P = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.00-0.04) and VTE subtypes (portal vein thrombosis: P = 0.04, 95%CI: 0.02-0.06; deep vein thrombosis: P = 0.03, 95%CI: 0.01-0.05; central venous catheter-related thrombosis: P = 0.23, 95%CI: 0.00-0.46; thromboembolic events: P = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.01-0.03) revealed a significant correlation between VTE risk and IBD. Patients with IBD were more susceptible to VTE risk than those without IBD (OR = 2.99, 95%CI: 1.45-6.18). The funnel plot was asymmetric, suggesting the presence of significant publication bias. Pediatric and adolescent IBD patients have an increased VTE risk. UC and CD patients exhibited a high risk of VTE. The risk of VTE subtypes was increased in IBD patients.
CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis showed that the incidence and risk of VTE are significantly increased in pediatric and adolescent IBD patients. Thus, IBD might be a risk factor for VTE in children and young adults. High-quality prospective cohort studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",Zhang XY; Dong HC; Wang WF; Zhang Y,2022,World journal of gastroenterology,28,16,1705-1717,10.3748/wjg.v28.i16.1705,"Zhang, X.

38584861,Microbiota Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: In both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) the immune reaction is - at least partially - directed against components of the luminal microbiota of the gut. These immune responses as well as other factors contribute to a phenomenon frequently described as ""dysbiosis"" meaning an alteration of the composition of the colonic microbiota. To improve the dysbiosis and to restore the normal composition of the colonic microbiota, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been tested as a therapeutic option to induce and maintain remission in IBD patients.
SUMMARY: This review will first discuss changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota found in IBD patients and second the therapeutic potential of microbiological interventions for the treatment of these patients. FMT has been studied in several clinical trials in both, CD and UC. Reported results and subsequent meta-analyses indicate that FMT may be effective to induce remission in UC. However, the optimal route of FMT, the necessary number of administrations and the question whether life bacteria of freshly prepared stool is more effective than frozen are still unclear. Concepts associated with an optimization of FMT such as the ""super donor concept"" or the ""consortia-approach"" will be discussed to illustrate open questions and difficulties associated with microbiota therapy in IBD.
KEY MESSAGES: The microbiota composition in IBD patients shows significant alterations compared to healthy individuals termed as ""dysbiosis"". FMT and other therapeutic approaches to modify the microbiota composition have been studied in clinical trials in recent years. Efficacy has been shown in UC; however, many questions with respect to the optimization of microbiota therapy remain to be answered.",Biedermann L; Kreienbühl A; Rogler G,2024,Visceral medicine,40,2,92-101,10.1159/000536254,"Biedermann, L., Kreienbühl, A., & Rogler, G.

40229330,The impact of inflammatory bowel disease on dementia risk: a current systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Emerging evidence indicates that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and dementia may share underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors. However, the association between a prior IBD diagnosis and the subsequent risk of dementia remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to February 4, 2025, without language restrictions. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated methodological quality and risk of bias. Observational studies comparing dementia risk in IBD and non-IBD populations were included. Pooled effect estimates for odds ratios (OR) were calculated using random-effects models. A total of 10 population-based studies, involving 7,895,339 participants (269,387 with IBD), were included. Meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant association between IBD and dementia risk (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.27, P = 0.0001). However, IBD was not associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.98-1.36, P = 0.09). Stratified analysis by IBD type revealed a positive association between both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and dementia risk (UC: OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.25, P = 0.002, I2 = 81%; CD: OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11-1.43, P = 0.0003, I2 = 53%). This study identifies a significant correlation between IBD and dementia, suggesting that IBD patients have an elevated risk of developing dementia. However, current evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. Further research should explore whether effective IBD treatments can mitigate this risk and elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these conditions.",Peng TR; Lin HH; Yang LJ; Huang YY; Wu TW; Chao YC,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,12852,10.1038/s41598-025-96331-w,"Peng, T.

34335253,Natural Anti-Inflammatory Compounds as Drug Candidates for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents chronic recurrent intestinal inflammation resulting from various factors. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been identified as the two major types of IBD. Currently, most of the drugs for IBD used commonly in the clinic have adverse reactions, and only a few drugs present long-lasting treatment effects. Moreover, issues of drug resistance and disease recurrence are frequent and difficult to resolve. Together, these issues cause difficulties in treating patients with IBD. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of IBD is of significance. In this context, research on natural compounds exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity could be a novel approach to developing effective therapeutic strategies for IBD. Phytochemicals such as astragalus polysaccharide (APS), quercetin, limonin, ginsenoside Rd, luteolin, kaempferol, and icariin are reported to be effective in IBD treatment. In brief, natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activities are considered important candidate drugs for IBD treatment. The present review discusses the potential of certain natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives in the prevention and treatment of IBD.",Duan L; Cheng S; Li L; Liu Y; Wang D; Liu G,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,684486,10.3389/fphar.2021.684486,"Duan, L., Cheng, S., Li, L., Liu, Y., Wang, D., & Liu, G.

39474330,Intestinal Ultrasonography Diagnostic Performance and Feasibility in IBD during Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis.,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are associated to poor maternal and foetal outcomes during pregnancy, requiring a strict monitoring of the disease activity, preferably with non-invasive modalities. There are numerous data confirming intestinal ultrasonography (IUS) accuracy and efficacy for the detection of IBD disease activity and complications, but data in pregnant IBD patients are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and feasibility of IUS to monitor IBD activity throughout pregnancy.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies on the use of ultrasound modality in pregnant inflammatory bowel disease women from the date of inception until April 2024 using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases, with keywords including (1) ultrasound/ultrasonography, (2) pregnancy, and (3) IBD (CD and UC). Additional relevant studies were identified from cross-referencing and hand-searches of references of the retrieved articles. We included fully published observational studies and abstracts.
RESULTS: Overall, five studies have been selected from 264 citations. All studies were highly heterogeneous in the definition of disease activity as reference standard, IUS protocols, and outcomes. Two of them used a cut-off value of faecal calprotectin (FCP) >100 μg/g. In one of them, clinical scores were used when the FCP value was ≥100-249 μg/g and FCP ≥250 μg/g was considered as an active disease independently of clinical scores. Only one study used a single reference standard with a Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) >4. Across these 3 studies, results suggest a relatively good specificity (range 83-98%) but low sensitivity (range 33-84%) to detect disease's activity. Only 1 study analysed IUS performance in detecting remission with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 92% compared to the reference standard. The size of the uterus limits the visualization of the terminal ileum and the sigmoid from the second trimester and the third trimester, respectively. The evaluation of the rectum remains limited.
CONCLUSION: IUS appears to offer a practical, readily available and non-invasive means of monitoring disease activity in IBD pregnant women. However, existing literature on IUS accuracy is limited and further studies with standardized reference comparator are needed.",Pillet J; Voirol-Perrin J; Martel M; Kherad O; Restellini S,2024,Inflammatory intestinal diseases,9,1,229-240,10.1159/000541017,"Pillet, J., Voirol-Perrin, J., Martel, M., Kherad, O., & Restellini, S.

32929762,Prevalence of the pathobiont adherent-invasive Escherichia coli and inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Escherichia coli pathobionts and particularly the adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) may play a putative role in initiating and maintaining the inflammatory process in the intestinal tissues of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, by providing stimulatory factors that trigger gut immune system activation. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of AIEC among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to February 2020 for relevant publications reporting the prevalence of AIEC in IBD patients. The prevalence rate of AIEC among CD and UC patients, the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated compared to non-IBD controls.
RESULTS: The final dataset included 12 studies, all investigating AIEC isolates from ileal/colonic specimens. The OR for prevalence of AIEC in CD patients was 3.27 (95% CI 1.79-5.9) compared with non-IBD controls. The overall pooled prevalence of AIEC among CD patients was 29% (95% CI 0.17-0.45), whereas this prevalence was calculated to be 9% (95% CI 0.03-0.19) in controls. Moreover, the prevalence of AIEC in UC subjects was calculated 12% (95% CI 0.01-0.34), while AIEC showed a prevalence of 5% (95% CI 0.0-0.17) among the controls. The OR for prevalence of AIEC in UC patients was 2.82 (95% CI 1.11-7.14) compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial increase in the prevalence of AIEC in IBD patients compared with controls. This review supports the growing evidence that AIEC could be involved in both CD and UC pathogenesis.",Nadalian B; Yadegar A; Houri H; Olfatifar M; Shahrokh S; Asadzadeh Aghdaei H; Suzuki H; Zali MR,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,4,852-863,10.1111/jgh.15260,"Nadalian, B., Yadegar, A., Houri, H., Olfatifar, M., Shahrokh, S., Asadzadeh Aghdaei, H., Suzuki, H., & Zali, M.

35288834,Diagnostic Delay in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Delays in diagnosing pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are common, but the extent of this delay remains unclear due to variations in reported time-periods between studies. The objectives of this systematic review were to examine the extent of diagnostic delay in pediatric IBD and examine any association between specific characteristics and length of diagnostic delay.
METHODS: We identified studies from several medical bibliographical databases (EMBASE, Medline and CINAHL) from their inception to April 2021. Studies examining pediatric cohorts (< 18 years old) defined as having a diagnosis of Crohn's Disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), or by the more general definition of IBD, and reporting a median time-period between the onset of symptoms and a final diagnosis (diagnostic delay) were included. Two reviewers selected each study, extracted data, and assessed their quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Narrative synthesis was then used to examine the extent of overall diagnostic delay and delay associated with specific sample characteristics.
RESULTS: Of the 10,119 studies initially identified, 24 were included in the review. The overall median diagnostic delay range was 2-10.4 months for IBD, 2.0-18.0 months for UC and 4.0-24.0 months for CD. However, for approximately two thirds of UC (68.8%) and CD (66.7%) studies, delay ranged from 2.0-3.0 and 4.0-6.3 months, respectively. A longer delay was significantly associated with several sample characteristics; however, these were too infrequently examined to draw robust conclusion on their role.
CONCLUSION: Children continue to wait several months for a final diagnosis of IBD, and those with CD experience longer delay than those with UC. The role of specific characteristics on delay needs further exploration.",Ajbar A; Cross E; Matoi S; Hay CA; Baines LM; Saunders B; Farmer AD; Prior JA,2022,Digestive diseases and sciences,67,12,5444-5454,10.1007/s10620-022-07452-5,"Ajbar, A., Cross, E., Matoi, S., Hay, C.

33436549,The role of the Hippo pathway in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disorder that primarily comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Owing to its increasing prevalence in Eastern countries and the intractable challenges faced during IBD treatment, extensive research on IBD has been carried out over the last few years. Although the precise aetiology of IBD is undefined, the currently accepted hypothesis for IBD pathogenesis considers it to be a combination of environment, genetic predisposition, gut microbiota, and abnormal immunity. A recently emerged signalling pathway, the Hippo pathway, acts as a key regulator of cell growth, tissue homoeostasis, organ size, and has been implicated in several human cancers. In the past few years, studies have revealed the importance of the Hippo pathway in gastrointestinal tract physiology and gastrointestinal diseases, such as colorectal cancer and IBD. However, the role of the Hippo pathway and its exact impact in IBD remains to be elucidated. This review summarises the latest scientific literature on the involvement of this pathway in IBD from the following perspectives that account for the IBD pathogenesis: intestinal epithelial cell regeneration, immune regulation, gut microbiota, and angiogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of the specific role of the Hippo pathway in IBD will provide novel insights into future research directions and clinical implications of the Hippo pathway.",Xie Z; Wang Y; Yang G; Han J; Zhu L; Li L; Zhang S,2021,Cell death & disease,12,1,79,10.1038/s41419-021-03395-3,"Xie, Z., Wang, Y., Yang, G., Han, J., Zhu, L., Li, L., & Zhang, S.

34876831,Indeterminate Colitis - Update on Treatment Options.,"Indeterminate colitis (IC) is described in approximately 5-15% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It usually reflects a difficulty or lack of clarity in distinguishing between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) on biopsy or colectomy specimens. The diagnostic difficulty may explain the variability in the reported prevalence and incidence of IC. Clinically, most IC patients tend to evolve over time to a definite diagnosis of either UC or CD. IC has also been interchangeably described as inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU). This review offers an overview of the available limited literature on the conventional medical and surgical treatments for IC. In contrast to the numerous studies on the medical management of UC and CD, there are very few data from dedicated controlled trials on the treatment of IC. The natural evolution of IC more closely mimics UC. Regarding medical options for treatment, most patients diagnosed with IC are treated similarly to UC, and treatment choices are based on disease severity. Others are managed similarly to CD if there are features suggestive of CD, including fissures, skin tags, or rectal sparing. In medically refractory IC, surgical treatment options are limited and include total proctocolectomy (TPC) and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), with its associated risk factors and complications. Post-surgical complications and pouch failure rates were historically thought to be more common in IC patients, but recent meta-analyses reveal similar rates between UC and IC patients. Future therapies in IBD are focused on known mechanisms in the disease pathways of UC and CD. Owing to the lack of IC-specific studies, clinicians have traditionally and historically extrapolated the data to IC patients based on their symptomatology, clinical course, and endoscopic findings.",Venkateswaran N; Weismiller S; Clarke K,2021,Journal of inflammation research,14,,6383-6395,10.2147/JIR.S268262,"Venkateswaran, N., Weismiller, S., & Clarke, K.

36425101,Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a higher chance of developing periodontitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis affects up to one billion people worldwide, and has been proven to be associated with several systemic inflammatory conditions. This study investigates the specific relationship between two multifactorial diseases: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and periodontitis. To thoroughly explore this issue, we investigated separately whether IBD patients have a higher chance of developing periodontitis, and equally, whether patients with periodontitis have a higher chance of developing IBD.
METHODS: The systematic search was performed in three databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Trials, and Embase, up to 26 October 2021. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. All eligible studies investigating the association between IBD and periodontitis from either direction were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. As a primary outcome, we investigated the prevalence of IBD and periodontitis, and calculated the odds ratio (OR). Our secondary outcomes involved comparing the clinical periodontal outcomes of IBD patients to those of IBD-free patients.
RESULTS: The systematic search resulted in 1,715 records, 14 of which were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 8 for quantitative synthesis. On the basis of the results of the primary outcome, IBD diagnosis was associated with significantly higher odds of periodontitis: OR = 2.65 (CI: 2.09-3.36, I 2 = 0 (CI: 0-0.75)). For subgroup analysis, we investigated separately the odds in Crohn's disease (CD) patients: OR = 2.22 (CI: 1.49-3.31, I 2 = 0.05 (CI: 0-0.76)) and in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients: OR = 3.52 (CI: 2.56 to 4.83, I 2 = 0 (CI: 0-0.75)); the odds were significantly higher in all cases. Two studies investigated whether patients with periodontitis were more susceptible to IBD, and both found that periodontitis was significantly associated with the risk of subsequent UC, but not with subsequent CD. However, more studies are needed to prove an association.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis confirmed that IBD patients have a higher chance of developing periodontitis, and are a higher risk population in dentistry. Both dentists and gastroenterologists should be aware of this relationship and should emphasize the importance of prevention even more than in the healthy population.

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical significance of peripheral blood NLR in IBD patients.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases from inception to May 10, 2021. We used the standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the pooled effect and subgroup analysis to investigate heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies including 2185 IBD patients and 993 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. The peripheral blood NLR values were significantly higher in 1,092 IBD patients than in 933 HCs (SMD = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05-2.02, P < 0.001) and in 1,269 patients with active IBD than in 1,056 patients with remissive IBD (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.06-2.05, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of the major subtypes of IBD revealed significantly elevated peripheral blood NLR values in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) compared to HCs (SMD = 2.04), remissive UC than HCs (SMD = 0.63), and active UC than in those with remissive UC (SMD = 1.32) (P < 0.05). Both Crohn's disease (CD) patients and active CD patients had significantly elevated peripheral blood NLR values than HCs with the SMD of 0.52 and 3.53 (P < 0.001).

Much less has been investigated and is known in gastrointestinal diseases beyond irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), especially in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). For the purpose of this review, we screened the Journal of Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies (JIPS) database with approximately 4,500 genuine placebo research articles and identified nine meta-analyses covering more than 135 randomized and placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 10,000 patients with Crohn ́s disease (CD) and another five meta-analyses with 150 RCTs and more than 10,000 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Only three discussed nocebo effects, especially in the context of clinical use of biosimilars to treat inflammation. The articles were critically analyzed with respect to the size of the placebo response in CD and UC, its effects on clinical improvement versus maintenance of remission, and mediators and moderators of the response identified. Finally, we discussed and compared the differences and similarities of the placebo responses in IBD and IBS and the nocebo effect in switching from biologics to biosimilars in IBD management.",Enck P; Klosterhalfen S,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,641436,10.3389/fphar.2021.641436,"Enck, P., & Klosterhalfen, S.

38792911,Exploring Electrical Neuromodulation as an Alternative Therapeutic Approach in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Background and Objectives: This review systematically evaluates the potential of electrical neuromodulation techniques-vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), and tibial nerve stimulation (TNS)-as alternative treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). It aims to synthesize current evidence on the efficacy and safety of these modalities, addressing the significant burden of IBD on patient quality of life and the limitations of existing pharmacological therapies. Materials and Methods: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of studies from PubMed, focusing on research published between 1978 and 2024. The review included animal models and clinical trials investigating the mechanisms, effectiveness, and safety of VNS, SNS, and TNS in IBD management. Special attention was given to the modulation of inflammatory responses and its impact on gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders associated with IBD. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that VNS, SNS, and TNS can significantly reduce inflammatory markers and improve symptoms in IBD patients. These techniques also show potential in treating related gastrointestinal disorders during IBD remission phases. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these benefits remain to be fully elucidated, and there is considerable variability in treatment parameters. Conclusions: Electrical neuromodulation holds promise as a novel therapeutic avenue for IBD, offering an alternative to patients who do not respond to traditional treatments or experience adverse effects. The review highlights the need for further rigorous studies to optimize stimulation parameters, understand long-term outcomes, and integrate neuromodulation effectively into IBD treatment protocols.",Dilixiati S; Yan J; Qingzhuoga D; Song G; Tu L,2024,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",60,5,,10.3390/medicina60050729,"Dilixiati, S., Yan, J., Qingzhuoga, D., Song, G., & Tu, L.

37543401,When and Where Should Surgery Be Positioned in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease?,"Surgery for children and adolescents with IBD is often thought of as a combination of a failure of medical management and the only option for the severe complications of the disease such as uncontrolled GI bleeding, perforation, fistulae, sepsis, and bowel obstruction. However, in CD, surgery can sometimes be an appropriate option to control disease progression, improve symptoms, allow children to get back on the growth curve, and avoid the toxicities of prolonged use of steroids. In UC, the decision to operate is theoretically curative but the long-term options mandate either intestinal continuity with an ileal pouch or a lifelong ileostomy, both of which can have significant impacts in patients' quality of life.",Lipskar AM,2023,Gastroenterology clinics of North America,52,3,579-587,10.1016/j.gtc.2023.06.001,"Lipskar, A.

38585636,Probiotics for inflammatory bowel disease: Is there sufficient evidence?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to chronic inflammatory disorders of the gut. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are two subtypes of IBD. Evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBD, so probiotics have garnered a lot of interest as a potential treatment or prevention for IBD. However, clinical evidence of the efficacy of probiotics is still debatable. We performed a literature review. An advanced search considered clinical studies on probiotic for IBD from inception to 2023 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. In the treatment of UC with probiotics, only Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 for maintenance treatment of UC in remission, and Bifidobacterium and VSL#3 for induction of remission in patients with mild to moderately active UC have shown strong evidence. Currently, there are no definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of probiotics in CD. The mechanism of probiotic treatment for IBD may be related to reducing oxidative stress, repairing the intestinal barrier, regulating intestinal flora balance, and modulating intestinal immune response. Differences in the benefits of probiotics between CD and UC may be attributable to the different lesion extent and immune-mediated pathophysiology. More robust randomized clinical trials are required to validate the efficacy and safety of diverse probiotic strains in IBD.",Ma Y; Yang D; Huang J; Liu K; Liu H; Wu H; Bao C,2024,Open life sciences,19,1,20220821,10.1515/biol-2022-0821,"Ma, Y., Yang, D., Huang, J., Liu, K., Liu, H., Wu, H., & Bao, C.

32959603,Extraintestinal Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Middle Eastern Patients.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), are gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders with many Extraintestinal Manifestations (EIMs). Previously reported incidences of EIMs in IBD patients have ranged from 10% to 50%. The large variation in occurrence of EIMs has been linked to genetic predisposition. Correlations between individual EIMs are unclear. Therefore, we aim to estimate the incidence of EIMs in a Middle Eastern cohort of patients with IBD and examine possible relationships with EIMs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving all patients included in the King Abdulaziz University IBD information system registry between 2013 and 2018. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, and EIMs were extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics: the standard Student's t-test and chi-squared test. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations using STATA software version 11.2 (StataCorp, TX, USA).
RESULTS: We reviewed the electronic medical files of 284 patients with confirmed IBD, of which 158 (55.6%) were females, the mean age was 27.8 (±15) years; 146 (51.4%) patients had CD and 138 (48.6%) UC. The overall incidence risk of EIMs was 138 (52.3%) over a mean duration of follow up of 7.3 (±3.9) years. The most common EIM was arthritis (33%), followed by aphthous ulcers (16%). Pyoderma gangrenosum occurred in 8% of patients and appeared to be specific for CD patients (p = 0.002), whereas Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) was more specific for UC (p = 0.001). Certain EIMs appeared to occur together such as arthritis with PSC (p = 0.001). Regression analysis identified disease type (in favor of UC; odds ratio = 0.50, p = 0.03) and age at the time of diagnosis (odds ratio = 1.04, p = 0.001) as the only significant predictors of EIMs.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that more than half of IBD patients have at least one EIM. Contrary to what has often been reported, we found that EIMs occur more commonly in UC than CD. A multidisciplinary assessment is recommended as part of IBD management to improve overall health outcomes.",Adam H; Alqassas M; Saadah OI; Mosli M,2020,Journal of epidemiology and global health,10,4,298-303,10.2991/jegh.k.200330.001,"Adam, H., Alqassas, M., Saadah, O.

32335670,Relapse From Deep Remission After Therapeutic De-escalation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the relapse rate after therapeutic de-escalation in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients who achieved deep remission [DR].
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and major gastroenterology conferences up to July 2019 for studies reporting relapse in adult patients with DR who subsequently underwent therapeutic de-escalation. Eligible studies defined DR as at least a combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing/endoscopic remission. The primary outcome was cumulative 1-year and 2-year relapse rates after therapeutic de-escalation. Secondary outcomes were relapse rates in ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD], relapse after anti-tumour necrosis factor-α [anti-TNFα] de-escalation, and the rate of disease response recapture following re-escalation.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies encompassing 837 patients were identified. The cumulative relapse rate after therapeutic de-escalation was 28.7% within 1 year [12 studies], and 38.4% within 2 years [eight studies]. Relapse rates within 1 year and 2 years were comparable between UC [five studies; 25.4% and 37.4%] and CD [seven studies; 34.1% and 39.9%]. Ten studies reported de-escalation of anti-TNFα, of which 29.8% patients relapsed within 1 year and 41.4% within 2 years. Response recapture following re-escalation [eight studies] was 75.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite achieving deep remission, therapeutic de-escalation in this patient population is associated with significant relapse risk within 1 year and 2 years. This risk is more pronounced in patients requiring anti-TNFα for management, likely because of more severe disease. Similar rates of relapse were reported among UC and CD within these time periods. These findings suggest that combined clinical and endoscopic remission should not be an impetus to consider therapeutic de-escalation.",Zhang B; Gulati A; Alipour O; Shao L,2020,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,14,10,1413-1423,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa087,"Zhang, B., Gulati, A., Alipour, O., & Shao, L.

38597690,Physical Activity is Associated with a Decreased Risk of Developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Modifiable risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], such as physical activity, may be used as prevention strategies. However, the findings of previous studies on the association between physical activity and IBD risk have been inconsistent. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of physical activity on IBD risk.
METHODS: A search was conducted for relevant studies published before April 2023 that assessed the effect of pre-IBD diagnosis levels of physical activity on IBD incidence. Individual summary statistics [relative risks; RR], and confidence intervals [CI] were extracted with forest plots generated. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] approach to assess the quality of evidence.
RESULTS: Ten observational studies were included. For cohort studies, there were 1182 Crohn's disease [CD] and 2361 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients, with 860 992 participants without IBD. For case-control studies, there were 781 CD to 2636 controls, and 1127 UC to 3752 controls. Compared with individuals with low physical activity levels, the RRs of CD in individuals with high physical activity levels for cohort and case-control studies were 0.78 [95% CI 0.68-0.88, p = 0.0001] and 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.95, p = 0.003], respectively. For UC, the RRs were 0.62 [95% CI 0.43-0.88, p = 0.008] and 0.74 [95% CI 0.51-1.07, p = 0.11].
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that physical activity is inversely associated with the risk of developing IBD, more so in CD than in UC.",Tiong HT; Fan D; Frampton C; Ananthakrishnan AN; Gearry RB,2024,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,18,9,1476-1485,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjae053,"Tiong, H.

36232412,The Gut-Immune-Brain Axis: An Important Route for Neuropsychiatric Morbidity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety and depression. Both conditions strongly worsen IBD disease burden. In the present review, we summarize the current understanding of the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety in IBD. We present a stepwise cascade along a gut-immune-brain axis initiated by evasion of chronic intestinal inflammation to pass the epithelial and vascular barrier in the gut and cause systemic inflammation. We then summarize different anatomical transmission routes of gut-derived peripheral inflammation into the central nervous system (CNS) and highlight the current knowledge on neuroinflammatory changes in the CNS of preclinical IBD mouse models with a focus on microglia, the brain-resident macrophages. Subsequently, we discuss how neuroinflammation in IBD can alter neuronal circuitry to trigger symptoms like depression and anxiety. Finally, the role of intestinal microbiota in the gut-immune-brain axis in IBD will be reviewed. A more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system and the CNS accounting for the similarities and differences between UC and CD will pave the path for improved prediction and treatment of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in IBD and other inflammatory diseases.",Masanetz RK; Winkler J; Winner B; Günther C; Süß P,2022,International journal of molecular sciences,23,19,,10.3390/ijms231911111,"Masanetz, R.

33155879,Effects of the Use of Curcumin on Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term used to describe chronic inflammatory disorders related to a substantial reduction in the quality of life of patients. Some patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are refractory to conventional therapies, and Curcuma longa derivatives have been considered as adjuvants. Owing to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, some clinical trials used this plant in the therapeutic approach of IBD, and some meta-analyses evaluated the outcomes found in these studies. Owing to controversial findings, our systematic review aimed to evaluate these studies to show whether C. longa compounds can still be considered in the therapeutic approach of patients with CD and UC. MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane were searched, and Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed. The results of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed promising results with the use of curcumin in the therapeutic approach of both UC and CD patients. Some meta-analyses show controversial results, possibly due to the presence of bias in the included studies. The actions of curcumin are achieved by several mechanisms, such as reducing the expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, it reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anions and malondialdehyde. The results of using curcumin in CD and UC patients are challenging to be evaluated because RCTs are variable in the dose and the formulations of curcumin, in the time of treatment, and the route of administration. The number of patients in the samples is also usually small.",Goulart RA; Barbalho SM; Lima VM; Souza GA; Matias JN; Araújo AC; Rubira CJ; Buchaim RL; Buchaim DV; Carvalho ACA; Guiguer ÉL,2021,Journal of medicinal food,24,7,675-685,10.1089/jmf.2020.0129,"Goulart, R.

35050153,A Novel Pathway of Flavonoids Protecting against Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Modulating Enteroendocrine System.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a comprehensive term for chronic or relapsing inflammatory diseases occurring in the intestinal tract, generally including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Presently, the pathogenesis of IBD is unknown, yet multiple factors have been reported to be related with the development of IBD. Flavonoids are phytochemicals with biological activity, which are ubiquitously distributed in edible plants, such as fruits and vegetables. Recent studies have demonstrated impressively that flavonoids have anti-IBD effects through multiple mechanisms. These include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions; the preservation of the epithelial barrier integrity, the intestinal immunomodulatory property, and the shaping microbiota composition and function. In addition, a few studies have shown the impact of flavonoids on enterohormones release; nonetheless, there is hardly any work showing the link between flavonoids, enterohormones release and IBD. So far, the interaction between flavonoids, enterohormones and IBD is elucidated for the first time in this review. Furthermore, the inference can be drawn that flavonoids may protect against IBD through modulating enterohormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), GLP-2, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors), ghrelin and cholecystokinin (CCK). In conclusion, this manuscript explores a possible mechanism of flavonoids protecting against IBD.",Li M; Weigmann B,2022,Metabolites,12,1,,10.3390/metabo12010031,"Li, M., & Weigmann, B. (2022).

36158031,Apheresis: A cell-based therapeutic tool for the inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a hallmark of leukocyte infiltration, followed by the release of cytokines and interleukins. Disease progression to Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD) remained largely incurable. The genetic and environmental factors disrupt enteral bacteria in the gut, which hampers the intestinal repairing capability of damaged mucosa. Commonly practiced pharmacological therapies include 5-aminosalicylic acid with corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. New interventions such as CDP571 and TNF-blocking RDP58 report the loss of patient response. This review discusses the non-pharmacologic selective granulocyte-monocyte-apheresis (GMA) and leukocytapheresis (LCAP) that have been proposed as treatment modalities that reduce mortality. GMA, an extracorporeal vein-to-vein technique, presents a strong safety profile case for its use as a viable therapeutic option compared to GMA's conventional medication safety profile. GMA reported minimal to no side effects in the pediatric population and pregnant women. Numerous studies report the efficacious nature of GMA in UC patients, whereas data on CD patients is insufficient. Its benefits outweigh the risks and are emerging as a favored non-pharmacological treatment option. On the contrary, LCAP uses a general extracorporeal treatment that entraps leukocytes and suppresses cytokine release. It has been deemed more efficacious than conventional drug treatments, the former causing better disease remission, and maintenance. Patients with UC/CD secondary to complications have responded well to the treatment. Side effects of the procedure have remained mild to moderate, and there is little evidence of any severe adverse event occurring in most age groups. LCAP decreases the dependence on steroids and immunosuppressive therapies for IBD. The review will discuss the role of GMA and LCAP.",Yasmin F; Najeeb H; Naeem U; Moeed A; Koritala T; Surani S,2022,World journal of clinical cases,10,21,7195-7208,10.12998/wjcc.v10.i21.7195,"Yasmin, F., Najeeb, H., Naeem, U., Moeed, A., Koritala, T., & Surani, S.

35662873,The Role of Vitamin D in Immune System and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a nonspecific inflammatory disease that includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis of IBD is not fully understood but is most reported associated with immune dysregulation, dysbacteriosis, genetic susceptibility, and environmental risk factors. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the human body, and it not only regulates bone metabolism but also the immune system, the intestinal microbiota and barrier. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in IBD patients, and the abnormal low levels of vitamin D are highly correlated with disease activity, treatment response, and risk of relapse of IBD. Accumulating evidence supports the protective role of vitamin D in IBD through regulating the adaptive and innate immunity, maintaining the intestinal barrier and balancing the gut microbiota. This report aims to provide a broad overview of the role vitamin D in the immune system, especially in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD, and its possible role in predicting relapse.",Wu Z; Liu D; Deng F,2022,Journal of inflammation research,15,,3167-3185,10.2147/JIR.S363840,"Wu, Z., Liu, D., & Deng, F.

32452591,Review article: withdrawal of 5-aminosalicylates in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) are widely used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but emerging evidence suggests that they may be safely withdrawn in significant subsets of patients. This is important to address: 5-ASA therapy accounts for up to 25% of total healthcare costs in ulcerative colitis (UC), while almost a third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) receive long-term 5-ASA despite no clear evidence of benefit. Further, rationalising medication burden may improve overall adherence and outcome.
AIMS: To summarise the rationale for 5-ASA withdrawal, review the current evidence in both UC and CD and consider the data surrounding colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention, guiding an evidence-based withdrawal strategy.
METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies. Only papers published in English were reviewed, with priority given to randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses.
RESULTS: For patients with UC, consideration of 5-ASA withdrawal should be made on a case-by-case basis, but it appears safest for those in deep remission without any of the following risk factors: younger age (<40 years), remission for less than 2 years, a history of multiple flares, extensive disease. 5-ASA withdrawal should also be considered in patients with UC escalated to biologic therapy who have achieved remission and in all patients with CD. Although 5-ASA therapy may have chemopreventive benefits for CRC, the cost-benefit ratio appears significant, and this indication is not justified by evidence in those who have achieved remission and are continuing therapy with other agents, or in those in sustained remission without a history of extensive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of patients with IBD receive 5-ASA during their disease course, safe withdrawal appears possible in many, with important implications for both health economics and patient experience. A number of unanswered questions, however, remain.",Chapman TP; Frias Gomes C; Louis E; Colombel JF; Satsangi J,2020,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,52,1,73-84,10.1111/apt.15771,"Chapman, T.

34199428,"Probiotics, Prebiotics and Synbiotics in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract with periods of remission and relapses. The etiopathogenesis of IBD is multifactorial and has not been fully understood. Hence, only symptomatic treatment of these diseases is possible. The current pharmacological treatment has variable efficacy and is associated with the risk of significant side effects. Therefore, there is a constant need to search for new types of therapies with a high safety profile. Considering that the qualitative and quantitative profile of the gastrointestinal microbiome is often different in patients with IBD than in healthy individuals, there is a need for looking for therapies aimed at restoring intestinal microbiome homeostasis. Thus, the use of strictly defined probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics may become an alternative form of IBD therapy. There is evidence that treatment with certain probiotic strains, e.g., VSL#3 and Escherischia coli Nissle 1917, is an effective form of therapy to induce remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. So far, the effectiveness of the use of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in inducing or maintaining remission in patients with CD has not been confirmed. There are also reports of possible beneficial effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the course of IBD, especially UC. Further, well-planned studies on a large group of patients are needed to determine the role of specific probiotic strains, prebiotics, synbiotics and FMT in the treatment of IBD in adults and in children.",Akutko K; Stawarski A,2021,Journal of clinical medicine,10,11,,10.3390/jcm10112466,"Akutko, K., & Stawarski, A.

34203609,Highlighting the Relevance of Gut Microbiota Manipulation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Two different conditions are included in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), being distinguished by chronic recurrence of gut inflammation in persons that are genetically predisposed and subjected to environmental causative factors. The normal structure of the gut microbiome and its alterations in IBD were defined in several microbial studies. An important factor in the prolonged inflammatory process in IBD is the impaired microbiome or ""dysbiosis"". Thus, gut microbiome management is likely to be an objective in IBD treatment. In this review, we analyzed the existing data regarding the pathophysiological/therapeutic implications of intestinal microflora in the development and evolution of IBD. Furthermore, the main effects generated by the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation, and phytochemicals supplementation were analyzed regarding their potential roles in improving the clinical and biochemical status of patients suffering from Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and are depicted in the sections/subsections of the present paper. Data from the literature give evidence in support of probiotic and prebiotic therapy, showing effects such as improving remission rate, improving macroscopic and microscopic aspects of IBD, reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins, and improving the disease activity index. Therefore, the additional benefits of these therapies should not be ignored as adjuvants to medical therapy.",Pavel FM; Vesa CM; Gheorghe G; Diaconu CC; Stoicescu M; Munteanu MA; Babes EE; Tit DM; Toma MM; Bungau S,2021,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",11,6,,10.3390/diagnostics11061090,"Pavel, F.

33114313,MicroRNA Biomarkers in IBD-Differential Diagnosis and Prediction of Colitis-Associated Cancer.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These are chronic autoimmune diseases of unknown etiology affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The IBD population includes a heterogeneous group of patients with varying disease courses requiring personalized treatment protocols. The complexity of the disease often delays the diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate treatments. In a subset of patients, IBD leads to colitis-associated cancer (CAC). MicroRNAs are single-stranded regulatory noncoding RNAs of 18 to 22 nucleotides with putative roles in the pathogenesis of IBD and colorectal cancer. They have been explored as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Both tissue-derived and circulating microRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers in the differential diagnosis and in the prognosis of disease severity of IBD as well as predictive biomarkers in drug resistance. In addition, knowledge of the cellular localization of differentially expressed microRNAs is a prerequisite for deciphering the biological role of these important epigenetic regulators and the cellular localization may even contribute to an alternative repertoire of biomarkers. In this review, we discuss findings based on RT-qPCR, microarray profiling, next generation sequencing and in situ hybridization of microRNA biomarkers identified in the circulation and in tissue biopsies.",James JP; Riis LB; Malham M; Høgdall E; Langholz E; Nielsen BS,2020,International journal of molecular sciences,21,21,,10.3390/ijms21217893,"James, J.

39095249,Small molecules for inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of infection and malignancy: A systematic review and meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to ascertain whether small molecule drugs increase the risk of infection or malignancy in adult IBD patients.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of eight databases was conducted from their inception to November 2023. The risk of infections or malignancies in adult IBD patients treated with JAK inhibitors and S1P receptor modulators was compared. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were performed, and relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: 27 RCTs from 14 studies were included (n = 10,623). The evidence indicates that small molecule drugs increase the risk of any infections (RR: 1.23, 95 %CI: 1.05-1.44) and herpes zoster (RR: 2.23, 95 %CI: 1.39-3.57). Specifically, UC patients on Filgotinib and Tofacitinib, and CD patients on Upadacitinib, showed elevated risks of any infections (RR: 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.56; RR: 1.42, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.75; RR: 1.57, 95 % CI: 1.11-2.22). CD patients on Upadacitinib also had a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster (RR: 2.64, 95 %CI: 1.16-5.99). No infections were associated with S1P receptor modulators, and similarly, no malignancies were linked to small molecule drugs.

34307315,Artificial Intelligence Enhances Studies on Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is an idiopathic condition related to a dysregulated immune response to commensal intestinal microflora in a genetically susceptible host. As a global disease, the morbidity of IBD reached a rate of 84.3 per 100,000 persons and reflected a continued gradual upward trajectory. The medical cost of IBD is also notably extremely high. For example, in Europe, it has €3,500 in CD and €2,000 in UC per patient per year, respectively. In addition, taking into account the work productivity loss and the reduced quality of life, the indirect costs are incalculable. In modern times, the diagnosis of IBD is still a subjective judgment based on laboratory tests and medical images. Its early diagnosis and intervention is therefore a challenging goal and also the key to control its progression. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis and prognosis prediction has proven effective in many fields including gastroenterology. In this study, support vector machines were utilized to distinguish the significant features in IBD. As a result, the reliability of IBD diagnosis due to its impressive performance in classifying and addressing region problems was improved. Convolutional neural networks are advanced image processing algorithms that are currently in existence. Digestive endoscopic images can therefore be better understood by automatically detecting and classifying lesions. This study aims to summarize AI application in the area of IBD, objectively evaluate the performance of these methods, and ultimately understand the algorithm-dataset combination in the studies.",Chen G; Shen J,2021,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,9,,635764,10.3389/fbioe.2021.635764,"Chen, G., & Shen, J.

36768556,miRNA Molecules-Late Breaking Treatment for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in regulating epigenetic mechanisms in inflammation-related diseases. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which primarily include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are characterized by chronic recurrent inflammation of intestinal tissues. Due to the multifactorial etiology of these diseases, the development of innovative treatment strategies that can effectively maintain remission and alleviate disease symptoms is a major challenge. In recent years, evidence for the regulatory role of miRNAs in the pathogenetic mechanisms of various diseases, including IBD, has been accumulating. In light of these findings, miRNAs represent potential innovative candidates for therapeutic application in IBD. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the role of miRNAs in regulating inflammatory responses, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, and developing fibrosis in clinical and experimental IBD. The focus is on the existing literature, indicating potential therapeutic application of miRNAs in both preclinical experimental IBD models and translational data in the context of clinical IBD. To date, a large and diverse data set, which is growing rapidly, supports the potential use of miRNA-based therapies in clinical practice, although many questions remain unanswered.",Aggeletopoulou I; Mouzaki A; Thomopoulos K; Triantos C,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,3,,10.3390/ijms24032233,"Aggeletopoulou, I., Mouzaki, A., Thomopoulos, K., & Triantos, C.

32181078,Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Two-way Association?,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is an umbrella term that covers both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal system. Airway diseases are one of the most commonly studied manifestations of IBD. It is observed that populations with pre-existing obstructive pulmonary conditions are at higher risk of new-onset IBD. This newly documented evidence of increased incidence of IBD among patients with pulmonary diseases and the higher than the estimated prevalence of pulmonary diseases among IBD sufferers support the hypothesis of a two-way association. This review article focuses on summarizing the current knowledge and available evidence regarding the association between IBD and obstructive pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, bronchiectasis, and asthma. We utilized PubMed as the primary search source and database and included the free full-text articles available on it, published over the past five years. We reviewed literature from multiple regions of the world, such as the US, UK, China, and Canada and compiled this traditional review article utilizing the information collected from 4,966,459 patients. Specifications such as age and gender were not mentioned in all articles. This review will serve to strengthen the existing research database concerning the relationship between IBD and obstructive pulmonary diseases. It will help to highlight the significance of the two-way association between IBD and obstructive pulmonary disease and the importance of treating these two conditions simultaneously. It will also raise awareness about the importance of timely detection of IBD and associated airway complications, leading to decreased disease burden and the treatment cost.",Zergham AS; Sekhon AK; Mebasher A; Tserenpil G; Malik BH,2020,Cureus,12,1,e6836,10.7759/cureus.6836,"Zergham, A.

33010406,Treat to Target: The Role of Histologic Healing in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Endoscopic remission is a recognized therapeutic endpoint in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)). The impact of persistent histologic activity on long-term outcomes is less clear and limited by small studies.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed and Embase to identify eligible studies examining the association between histologic activity and relapse in patients with CD or UC in endoscopic remission. Studies were pooled together using random effects meta-analysis per the DerSimonian and Laird inverse variance method. The impact of different histologic scales, cut-offs, and individual features were examined.
FINDINGS: Our meta-analysis included 28 studies contributing 2,806 patients (2677 UC; 129 CD). In UC, histologically active disease was associated with an overall increased risk of relapse (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.91-3.04), with a similar effect noted in the subgroup with endoscopic Mayo endoscopic score of 0 vs 0 or 1. More rigorous Geboes cut-offs demonstrated numerically stronger impact on relapse rates-Geboes <3.1 (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.57-3.65), Geboes <2.1 (OR, 3.91; 95% CI, 2.21-6.91) and Geboes 0 (OR, 7.40; 95% CI, 2.00-18.27). Among individual histologic features, basal plasmacytosis (OR, 1.94), neutrophilic infiltrations (OR, 2.30), mucin depletion (OR, 2.05), and crypt architectural irregularities (OR, 2.22) predicted relapse. There was no association between histologic activity and relapse in CD.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with UC in endoscopic remission, persistent histologic activity is associated with higher rates of relapse. Greater degree of normalization may have a stronger impact.",Gupta A; Yu A; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Ananthakrishnan AN,2021,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,19,9,1800-1813.e4,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.09.046,"Gupta, A., Yu, A., Peyrin-Biroulet, L., & Ananthakrishnan, A.

33098703,"The effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics on the reduction of IBD complications, a periodic review during 2009-2020.","AIMS: To perform a systematic review on randomized controlled trials to examine the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in the treatment of IBD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, Web of science, Scopus and Google Scholar were systematically searched from January 2009 to January 2020 using the following keywords: 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Probiotics' and 'Clinical trial'. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 24.0. A total of 1832 articles were found during the initial search and 21 clinical trials were eligible. Studies comparing the effects of probiotics and placebo among patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) showed a significant difference in clinical outcomes. Moreover, probiotics improved the overall induction of remission rates among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics significantly decreased the IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-8 levels. Also, the need for systemic steroids, hospitalization, surgery, as well as histological score and disease activity index significantly decreased in patients who used probiotic or pro-/synbiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of probiotics, as food supplements, can induce anti-inflammatory reactions, balance the intestinal homeostasis and induce remission in IBD. The efficacy of probiotics on remission induction is more reported in UC rather than CD. Larger well-designed clinical trials are needed to further determine whether probiotics are of clear benefits for remission in IBD.",Darb Emamie A; Rajabpour M; Ghanavati R; Asadolahi P; Farzi S; Sobouti B; Darbandi A,2021,Journal of applied microbiology,130,6,1823-1838,10.1111/jam.14907,"Darb Emamie, A., Rajabpour, M., Ghanavati, R., Asadolahi, P., Farzi, S., Sobouti, B., & Darbandi, A.

32331305,Cannabis and Canabidinoids on the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Going Beyond Misuse.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by a chronic and recurrent gastrointestinal condition, including mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Cannabis sativa (CS) is widely used for medicinal, recreational, and religious purposes. The most studied compound of CS is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Besides many relevant therapeutic roles such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, there is still much controversy about the consumption of this plant since the misuse can lead to serious health problems. Because of these reasons, the aim of this review is to investigate the effects of CS on the treatment of UC and CD. The literature search was performed in PubMed/Medline, PMC, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The use of CS leads to the improvement of UC and CD scores and quality of life. The medical use of CS is on the rise. Although the literature shows relevant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could improve UC and CD scores, it is still not possible to establish a treatment criterion since the studies have no standardization regarding the variety and part of the plant that is used, route of administration and doses. Therefore, we suggest caution in the use of CS in the therapeutic approach of IBD until clinical trials with standardization and a relevant number of patients are performed.",Carvalho ACA; Souza GA; Marqui SV; Guiguer ÉL; Araújo AC; Rubira CJ; Goulart RA; Flato UAP; Bueno PCDS; Buchaim RL; Barbalho SM,2020,International journal of molecular sciences,21,8,,10.3390/ijms21082940,"Carvalho, A.

It is now widely used in food processing, cosmetics, dyes, etc. Current researching indicates that curcumin has high medical value, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrosis, immune regulation and other effects, and can be used to treat a variety of diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a nonspecific inflammatory disease of the intestine including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The drug treatment effect is often limited and accompanied by side effects.

33451106,Enteric Viruses and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a multifactorial disease in which dietary, genetic, immunological, and microbial factors are at play. The role of enteric viruses in IBD remains only partially explored. To date, epidemiological studies have not fully described the role of enteric viruses in inflammatory flare-ups, especially that of human noroviruses and rotaviruses, which are the main causative agents of viral gastroenteritis. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated the association between IBD, polymorphisms of the FUT2 and FUT3 genes (which drive the synthesis of histo-blood group antigens), and ligands for norovirus and rotavirus in the intestine. The role of autophagy in defensin-deficient Paneth cells and the perturbations of cytokine secretion in T-helper 1 and T-helper 17 inflammatory pathways following enteric virus infections have been demonstrated as well. Enteric virus interactions with commensal bacteria could play a significant role in the modulation of enteric virus infections in IBD. Based on the currently incomplete knowledge of the complex phenomena underlying IBD pathogenesis, future studies using multi-sampling and data integration combined with new techniques such as human intestinal enteroids could help to decipher the role of enteric viruses in IBD.",Tarris G; de Rougemont A; Charkaoui M; Michiels C; Martin L; Belliot G,2021,Viruses,13,1,,10.3390/v13010104,"Tarris, G., de Rougemont, A., Charkaoui, M., Michiels, C., Martin, L., & Belliot, G.

36799518,Mucosal immune systems of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: A review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in chronic or recurrent remission phase and is classified as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is a multifactorial disease that results from genetic and environmental factors, immunological disorders, and gut microbiota dysregulation called dysbiosis. Recently, the number of patients with IBD in Japan has been increasing. This review describes studies of T cells, such as type 1 helper T (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1) cells, and cytokines, such as IL-17 and IL-21, as representatives of mucosal immunity in IBD. Th1 cells and Tc1 cells are involved in Peyer's patches of CD. IL-12 significantly reduced the production of IL-17 but significantly increased in that of IFN-γ, and IL-21 reduced IL-17 production. It also describes genetic analysis studies on the cause of very early-onset IBD (VEO-IBD). Furthermore, 11.6% of patients with VEO-IBD presented with monogenic IBD in Japan. Genetic analysis for patients with VEO-IBD and suspected monogenic IBD was investigated. XIAP and heterozygous SLCO2A1 were detected owing to the result of functional confirmation, and several candidate genes were detected. Cytokine analysis and genetic analysis studies have revealed several pathophysiologies of IBD. Clinical and basic studies on mucosal immunity as well as immunological and genetic analyses are currently ongoing and are anticipated to provide an elaborate understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD.",Kudo T; Shimizu T,2023,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,65,1,e15511,10.1111/ped.15511,"Kudo, T., & Shimizu, T.

38137450,A Narrative Review of Cytokine Networks: Pathophysiological and Therapeutic Implications for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Pathogenesis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a lifelong inflammatory immune mediated disorder, encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); however, the cause and specific pathogenesis of IBD is yet incompletely understood. Multiple cytokines produced by different immune cell types results in complex functional networks that constitute a highly regulated messaging network of signaling pathways. Applying biological mechanisms underlying IBD at the single omic level, technologies and genetic engineering enable the quantification of the pattern of released cytokines and new insights into the cytokine landscape of IBD. We focus on the existing literature dealing with the biology of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and interactions that facilitate cell-based modulation of the immune system for IBD inflammation. We summarize the main roles of substantial cytokines in IBD related to homeostatic tissue functions and the remodeling of cytokine networks in IBD, which may be specifically valuable for successful cytokine-targeted therapies via marketed products. Cytokines and their receptors are validated targets for multiple therapeutic areas, we review the current strategies for therapeutic intervention and developing cytokine-targeted therapies. New biologics have shown efficacy in the last few decades for the management of IBD; unfortunately, many patients are nonresponsive or develop therapy resistance over time, creating a need for novel therapeutics. Thus, the treatment options for IBD beyond the immune-modifying anti-TNF agents or combination therapies are expanding rapidly. Further studies are needed to fully understand the immune response, networks of cytokines, and the direct pathogenetic relevance regarding individually tailored, safe and efficient targeted-biotherapeutics.",Vebr M; Pomahačová R; Sýkora J; Schwarz J,2023,Biomedicines,11,12,,10.3390/biomedicines11123229,"Vebr, M., Pomahačová, R., Sýkora, J., & Schwarz, J.

AIMS: To perform a meta-analysis regarding vedolizumab as first line of biological therapy for UC or CD.
METHODS: A systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases per December 2020 was undertaken. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models.
RESULTS: This systematic review identified 79 eligible studies with 4,520 and 3,494 bio-naïve patients with UC and CD, respectively, and 8,105 and 11,140 bio-exposed patients. Among bio-naïve patients with UC, a total of 40.0% (95%CI 27.0-54.0, I2=86%) and 63.9% (95%CI 47.0-79.2, I2=36%) achieved clinical remission at weeks 14 and 52, respectively. The corresponding rates in CD were 54.0% (95%CI 42.0-66.0, I2=23%), and 61.7% (95%CI 55.2-68.1, I2=0%). Bio-naïvety was associated with a higher probability of clinical remission at week 52 in UC (relative risk (RR)=1.32 (95%CI 1.14-1.53)), while this was only apparent until week 26 in CD (RR=1.60 (95%CI 1.30-1.95)). Finally, bio-naïve UC patients had a lower risk of serious adverse events (RR=0.29 (95%CI 0.09-0.95)).

33538671,Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Migrant Populations: Should we Look Even Further Back?,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to rise worldwide. Despite the advances in pharmacotherapy, the etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) remains underexplained. The migratory waves are a challenging setting to analyze the evolution of IBD prevalence and to infer its triggering factors.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to overview the literature regarding IBD prevalence and phenotype in first- and second-generation migrants Also, we aimed to summarize the migration history and to draw a possible correlation with IBD distribution.
METHODS: A non-systematic review was performed following electronic (PubMed and Web of Science) and manual searches on relevant topics.
RESULTS: Overall, first-generation migrants tend to maintain the IBD risk of the native country. On the following generation, the risk tends to converge to that of the destination country. Earlier age at migration modulates IBD risk, suggesting that the degree of exposure to environmental and socio-economic factors can be decisive for disease progression. In general, CD needs more time to reach a disease burden similar to that of the host country, indicating that UC may be more affected by nongenetic factors and genetic-nongenetic interactions.
CONCLUSION: IBD phenotypes and natural history vary in migrants and according to ethnicity; however, the trends are not consensual among cohorts. Further studies are warranted to analyze the effect of genetic background and environmental risk factors in different ethnic groups, providing evidence to move towards the identification of at-risk individuals, prevention, and earlier diagnosis of IBD.",Fiorino G; Estevinho MM; Lopes DJM; Chersi F; Allocca M; Souto MT; Danese S; Magro F,2021,Current drug targets,22,15,1706-1715,10.2174/1389450122666210203193817,"Fiorino, G., Estevinho, M.

32200523,Mode of Delivery Does Not Affect the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that exposures in early life that are known to influence microbiome development may affect the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cesarean section has been associated with altered colonization of commensal gut flora and is thought to predispose to immune-mediated diseases later in life.
AIMS: To evaluate the risk of IBD, Crohn's Disease (CD), and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) according to mode of delivery (C-section vs vaginal delivery).
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase. The primary outcome was the risk of IBD in individuals delivered vaginally compared to those born by C-section. Secondary outcomes were UC and CD risk according to mode of delivery and IBD risk in individuals born by emergent compared to elective C-section. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots and Egger's test. Study's quality was characterized using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which seven were population-based. No publication bias was detected. Overall, 14.164 IBD patients and 4.206.763 controls were included. Being born by C-section was not associated with increased risk of IBD [OR 1.01, 95% CI (0.81-1.27), p = 0.92], CD [OR 1.15, 95% CI (0.94-1.42), p = 0.18] or UC [OR 0.94, 95% CI (0.61-1.45), p = 0.79]. No differences were found between emergent and elective C-section in IBD [OR 1.05, 95% CI (0.59-1,87), p = 0.87].

The mean age at diagnosis ranged from 24.13 to 43.6 years in adult cases and from 4.5 to 16 years in pediatric cases. In most of the included studies, the majority of patients were male. The quantitative analysis revealed a pooled incidence rate of 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.4) per 100,000 persons per year for UC in the Arab world. Likewise, the pooled incidence rate for CD in the Arab world was 1.46 (95% CI 1.03-1.89) per 100,000 persons per year.
CONCLUSION: There is a growing incidence of IBD in the Arab world, while IBD patients from Arab countries may present with some different characteristics, compared to their counterparts in Europe.",Mosli M; Alawadhi S; Hasan F; Abou Rached A; Sanai F; Danese S,2021,Inflammatory intestinal diseases,6,3,123-131,10.1159/000518003,"Mosli, M., Alawadhi, S., Hasan, F., Abou Rached, A., Sanai, F., & Danese, S.

37773196,The role of Lactobacillus in inflammatory bowel disease: from actualities to prospects.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory disease, is comprised of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). IBD is closely related to a systemic inflammatory reaction and affects the progression of many intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. As one of the representative bacteria for probiotic-assisted therapy in IBD, multiple strains of Lactobacillus have been proven to alleviate intestinal damage and strengthen the intestinal immunological barrier, epithelial cell barrier, and mucus barrier. Lactobacillus also spares no effort in the alleviation of IBD-related diseases such as Colitis-associated Colorectal cancer (CAC), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Depression, Anxiety, Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH), and so on via gut-brain axis and gut-liver axis. This article aims to discuss the role of Lactobacillus in IBD and IBD-related diseases, including its underlying mechanisms and related curative strategies from the present to the future.",Li C; Peng K; Xiao S; Long Y; Yu Q,2023,Cell death discovery,9,1,361,10.1038/s41420-023-01666-w,"Li, C., Peng, K., Xiao, S., Long, Y., & Yu, Q.

36863421,Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of atherothrombotic disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are known to be at increased risk for venous thrombosis, while their risk for arterial ischemic events is debated. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the published literature on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in IBD patients and to identify any potential risk factors.
METHODS: The present study was performed according to PRISMA, with a systematic search on PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. Risk of MI was the primary end point, while all causes of death and stroke were secondary endpoints. Both univariate and multivariate pooled analysis were performed.
RESULTS: An overall population of 515,455 controls and 77,140 persons with IBD (26,852, 34.8% Crohn's disease, CD and 50,288, 65.2% ulcerative colitis, UC) was included. Mean age was similar across controls and IBD. Persons with CD and UC had lower rates of hypertension (14.5% vs. 14.6% vs. 25%), diabetes (2.9% vs. 5.2% vs. 9.2%) and dyslipidaemia (3.3% vs. 6.5% vs. 16.1%) compared to controls. Smoking did not significantly differ (17% vs. 17.5% vs. 10.6%). Pooled results of multivariate adjustment showed that, after a 5 years-follow-up, both CD and UC were at increased risk of MI (respectively HR 1.36 [1.12-1.64] and HR 1.24 [1.05-1.46]), of death (HR 1.55 [1.27-1.90] and HR 1.29 [1.01-1.64]), and of other CV disease as stroke (HR 1.22 [1.01-1.49] and HR 1.09 [1.03-1.15], all 95% CI).
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with IBD are at increased risk of MI, despite a lower prevalence of the classic risk factors for MI (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia).",D'Ascenzo F; Bruno F; Iannaccone M; Testa G; De Filippo O; Giannino G; Caviglia GP; Bernstein CN; De Ferrari GM; Bugianesi E; Armandi A; Ribaldone DG,2023,International journal of cardiology,378,,96-104,10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.02.042,"D'Ascenzo, F., Bruno, F., Iannaccone, M., Testa, G., De Filippo, O., Giannino, G., Caviglia, G.

36029078,Nutraceuticals in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: How the Panorama has Changed in the Last Decade?,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), mainly Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are recurrent idiopathic non-infectious chronic diseases widely diffused worldwide and characterized by moderate to severe mucosal damage.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the literature of the last 10 years to photograph preclinical and clinical data on the use of nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment, combined with the conventional drugs, of IBD.
METHOD: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were used to search for the most recent publications on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence on IBD and nutraceuticals, which were then assessed based on the originality and scientific rigor of the studies.
RESULTS: In the last decade, the interest in new healthy or therapeutic complementary or alternative approaches to conventional drugs in IBD has grown inexorably, as well as the incidence of these pathologies and the knowledge of their etiopathogenesis. In this context, a growing development of new nutraceutical products with a consequent increase in pre-clinical studies has been observed. However, this panorama does not yet translate into adequate clinical studies that can effectively endorse what was observed in pre-clinical studies; many of them are mostly aimed at resolving diseases related to IBD rather than IBD itself.
CONCLUSION: Despite the promising pre-clinical data about nutraceuticals and IBD, we are still very far from being able to postulate an adequate nutraceutical treatment of these pathologies and further studies are necessary to support this hypothesis.",Smeriglio A; Marcoccia D; Denaro M; Trombetta D,2023,Current medicinal chemistry,30,19,2165-2190,10.2174/0929867329666220428110427,"Smeriglio, A., Marcoccia, D., Denaro, M., & Trombetta, D.

40237230,Global prevalence of biologic drugs use in inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Biologics are increasingly essential in managing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) worldwide, as they can modify disease progression and improve patients' quality of life. This study aimed to analyze the global prevalence of and geographic variations in the use of biological drugs for IBD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published up to 21 July 2024, were identified from the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, IBECS, WPRIM, BRISA/RedETSA and LILACS databases. Population-based studies (cohort, case-control and cross-sectional) and studies using administrative databases with data on the prevalence of biological medicine use in patients with IBD were included. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, whereas heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and I2.
RESULTS: Of the 8239 titles, 68 (n = 3,482,385 patients) were included. An increase in the number of studies on the subject has been reported since 2017, and these studies have been mostly concentrated in high-income countries. A 15.06% (95% CI 11.84-18.28%) prevalence of biologic use in IBD worldwide was reported, predominantly concentrated in the use of anti-TNF agents 15.01% (95% CI 10.35-19.67%). Furthermore, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) had a greater prevalence of biologic use (21.41%; 95% CI 16.31-26.50%) than ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (9.70%; 95% CI 6.20-13.18%).
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies using population-based and administrative data and stratifying their analyses by disease type are required to confirm our findings.

36694316,Impact of Vitamin D on the Occurrence and Development of Intestinal Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"AIM: To determine the impact of vitamin D on the occurrence and progression of intestinal disorders, the authors of this study have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
BACKGROUND: Vitamin D regulates inflammation and immunity in association with reducing the disease symptoms of several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the exact role of vitamin D in the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases is unclear so far.
METHODOLOGY: The relevant studies were searched in PubMed and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of full-text studies was assessed using National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH) scale. The study was conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. The overall estimate was calculated in terms of risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval. The publication bias was assessed qualitatively using a funnel plot, and heterogeneity among studies was calculated using I2 statistics. All analyses were done using RevMan 5.0.
RESULTS: The overall risk ratio using random effect model was found to be 0.89 (0.70, 1.12), which indicates the non-significant role of vitamin D in the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases as compared to the non-vitamin D group. However, after exclusion of studies with low and high sample sizes, a significant reduction in intestinal diseases was observed in the vitamin D group as compared to the non-vitamin D group. Further, no heterogeneity among the studies was observed.
CONCLUSION: Based on available evidence, vitamin D might play a significant role in the reduction of intestinal diseases; however, more studies with high sample sizes are required to draw a valid conclusion.",Liu J; Wang Y; Zou Y; Li C,2023,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,26,12,2247-2258,10.2174/1386207326666230123151617,"Liu, J., Wang, Y., Zou, Y., & Li, C.

33850767,Inflammatory bowel disease and risk of urinary cancers: a systematic review and pooled analysis of population-based studies.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to elucidate the risk of urologic cancers in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science, and manual retrieval were conducted from inception to June 2020. Two reviewers independently searched the above databases and selected the studies using prespecified standardized criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies, and this meta-analysis was completed by STATA version 14.2.
RESULTS: A total of 12 cohort studies and 4 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were at significantly increased risk of renal cancer (RCa) [standardized incidence ratio (SIR): 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25-1.80; I2=42.4%], but not at increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa), bladder cancer (BCa) and male genital cancer. In the subgroup analysis, CD patients had a significantly higher RCa risk (SIR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.45-2.44; I2=39.9%). Besides, CD patients seemed to be at borderline significantly increased risks of PCa (SIR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.93-1.20; I2=15.1%) and BCa (SIR:1.19; 95% CI: 0.94-1.44; I2=0%), and UC patients seemed to be at borderline significantly increased risks of RCa (SIR:1.31; 95% CI: 0.94-1.67; I2=48.0%) and PCa (SIR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.93-1.33; I2=73.5%). Notably, we observed that IBD patients in Eastern countries have significantly increased PCa risk (SIR: 2.66; 95% CI: 1.52-3.81; I2=13.6%), especially for UC patients (SIR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.75-4.27; I2=0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that IBD patients with special reference to CD patients increase the risk of RCa. Besides, IBD patients in Asian countries have significantly increased risk of PCa, especially for UC patients. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the potential mechanism of RCa associated with IBD and the differences of the risk of urinary cancers between Eastern and Western countries.",Feng D; Yang Y; Wang Z; Wei W; Li L,2021,Translational andrology and urology,10,3,1332-1341,10.21037/tau-20-1358,"Feng, D., Yang, Y., Wang, Z., Wei, W., & Li, L.

37577790,Risk and incidence of colorectal stricture progressing to colorectal neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study aims to assess the risk of colorectal stricture progressing to colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The literature from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was searched from the date of databases' creation to 5 November 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Stata 15 software and R 4.04 software. Two case-control studies and 12 cohort studies were eventually included. Colorectal stricture in patients with IBD increased the risk of progressing to CRN [odds ratio (OR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.29, P = 0.042], but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to ACRN (OR: 3.56, 95% CI 0.56-22.70, P = 0.180). The risk of CRN were further distinguished in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) Our findings showed that colorectal stricture may increase the risk of progressing to CRN in patients with UC (OR = 3.53, 95%CI 1.62-7.68, P = 0.001), but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to CRN in patients with CD (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.54-2.21, P = 0.811). In conclusion, colorectal stricture in patients with IBD can be used as a risk factor for predicting CRN but cannot be used as a risk factor for predicting ACRN. Stricture is a risk factor for CRN in patients with UC but not in patients with CD. More prospective, multi-center studies with large samples are expected to confirm our findings.",Zhan Y; Cheng X; Mei P; Wu J; Ou Y; Cui Y,2023,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,35,10,1075-1087,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002614,"Zhan, Y., Cheng, X., Mei, P., Wu, J., Ou, Y., & Cui, Y.

39060735,Probiotics in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, incurable inflammatory condition of the gut. They comprise Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease (CD) may affect any tract of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is a transmural inflammatory condition; ulcerative colitis (UC), on the other hand, is limited to the mucosal layer of the rectum and colon. Treatment options available for both IBD are notoriously loaded with potentially serious side effects and risks. Although the pathogenesis of IBD involves a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, microbial and immunological factors, there is evidence that the interplay between the microbiota and the GI mucosa has a preponderant role. It is therefore no surprise that in recent years, a growing interest for effective and safer alternatives has focused on the potential role of prebiotics and-especially-probiotics.The mechanisms of action underlying the potential benefits of probiotics in IBD have been largely and quite extensively investigated in vitro and in vivo experiments. In terms of clinical evidence, the results of trials in the induction of remission of active CD or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics have been so far largely disappointing, to the point that their use in this disease cannot be at present recommended.On the contrary, for the treatment as well as for maintenance therapy of UC, there is clinical evidence of efficacy for some specific strains or multi-strain preparations.It is evident that this is a rapidly evolving and promising field; more data are very likely to yield a better understanding on what strains and in what doses should be used in different specific clinical settings, as we expect new and exciting developments of precision and even personalized therapy by the fast-growing field of probiogenomics.",Guandalini S,2024,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,1449,,135-142,10.1007/978-3-031-58572-2_8,"Guandalini, S.

38837416,Bidirectional associations between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review of longitudinal studies with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.,"The bidirectional associations between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with temporal directionality remain inconclusive. This study aims to evaluate the bidirectional associations between periodontitis and IBD through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched from inception to 27 February 2024. Two independent reviewers performed a review of the retrieved studies. Longitudinal studies, including cohort and nested case-control studies, were considered eligible for the study design. The pooled risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) derived from the meta-analysis were used to assess whether periodontitis (or IBD) was a risk factor for IBD (or periodontitis). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to evaluate the reliability of the results. Four studies (n = 10 270 912) on the risk of IBD in patients with periodontitis and two (n = 33 420) on the risk of periodontitis in patients with IBD were included. The result suggested that periodontitis did not increase the risk of IBD (pooled RR = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.09; p = .164; I-squared statistic [I2] = 27%). For subtypes of IBD, periodontitis was associated with the occurrence of ulcerative colitis (UC) (pooled RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21; p = .003; I2 = 38%), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92-1.04; p = .475; I2 = 0%). Specifically, the risk of UC was higher among men (pooled HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.22; p = .025; I2 = 0%) and smokers (pooled HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.42; p = .004; I2 = 0%) with periodontitis than their counterparts without periodontitis. Patients with IBD may have a higher risk of developing periodontitis (pooled HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26-1.49; p < .001; I2 = 18%); however, whether IBD subtypes increased the occurrence of periodontitis remained uncertain. The TSA results confirmed the reliability of the primary findings. Based on limited longitudinal evidence, patients with periodontitis do not exhibit an increased risk of developing IBD overall, but they are at increased risk of UC (not CD). On the contrary, patients with IBD have a higher risk of developing periodontitis over time. More high-quality longitudinal studies are needed to determine the effect of specific subtypes of IBD on periodontitis.",Wang Q; Chen S; Zhou J; Zhao L,2024,Journal of periodontal research,59,6,1083-1094,10.1111/jre.13291,"Wang, Q., Chen, S., Zhou, J., & Zhao, L.

35510325,Efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the outcomes of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
METHODS: electronic databases were searched for studies reporting on the efficacy and/or safety of FMT therapy for recurrent CDI in IBD. The meta-prop command of the meta package in R was used to assess efficacy and safety. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity regarding all outcomes.
RESULTS: eleven trials were included in the study. A pooled analysis showed that the initial cure rate of recurrent CDI among IBD patients was 80 % (95 % CI, 0.76, 0.84), and the overall cure rate after two or more FMT procedures was 90 % (95 % CI, 0.84, 0.94). The recurrence rate post-FMT therapy was 25 % (95 % CI: 0.20, 0.32). Sub-analyses suggested that the initial cure rate of CDI in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was higher than in Crohn's disease (CD) patients (85 % vs. 79 %), with no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). No serious adverse events were noted in any of the patients post-FMT.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT is an effective and safe treatment for recurrent CDI in patients with IBD. FMT should be considered early in cases of recurrent or refractory CDI. Multiple FMT procedures can improve the cure rate of CDI.",Cheng F; Huang Z; Li Z; Wei W,2022,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas,114,9,543-549,10.17235/reed.2022.8814/2022,"Cheng, F., Huang, Z., Li, Z., & Wei, W.

32105396,Epidemiology of fibrostenosing inflammatory bowel disease.,"Fibrostenosis occurs in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Up to 21% of patients with CD present with strictures at diagnosis, while the rate of stenosis varies from 1% to 11% in UC. Despite the increasing use of immunomodulators and biologics in treatment, there has been no decrease in the rate of progression from inflammatory to complicated disease phenotypes (either stricturing or penetrating). The presence of stenosis is an independent risk factor for surgery in patients with CD, who are at a risk of postoperative recurrence at a rate of up to 55% at 10 years after surgery. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) strictures are at risk of malignant transformation. Thus, surveillance colonoscopy should be offered to this group of patients. Several risk factors for the development of stricture have been identified. In CD, patients aged less than 40-years old, with perianal disease at diagnosis, who need steroids at the first flare up or have ileal disease are at the risk of developing strictures; while in UC, patients with extensive colitis and long-standing disease are at risk. Recently, microbiota signatures have also been identified as markers for stricture development. The presence of Ruminococcus spp. is associated with the development of stricture in pediatric patients with CD. In this review, we highlight the epidemiology, risk factors and natural history of fibrostenosing IBD.",Mak JWY; Ng SC,2020,Journal of digestive diseases,21,6,332-335,10.1111/1751-2980.12853,"Mak, J.

39825748,Systematic review on definitions of intestinal ultrasound treatment response and remission in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is emerging as a valuable tool to assess treatment response in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinical trials. This study details how IUS defines response and remission to evaluate treatment efficacy in IBD patients.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of studies from 1984 to March 31, 2024, focusing on IUS use in assessing treatment efficacy in IBD.
RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were included: 31 on Crohn's disease (CD), 12 on ulcerative colitis (UC) and 8 on IBD. Ileocolonoscopy was used as a reference standard in 53% of studies. IUS-defined response was reported in 47% of studies, with the majority (71%) using changes in bowel wall thickness (BWT) and color Doppler signals (CDS) as key indicators. IUS-defined remission was reported in 53% of studies, primarily using normalization of BWT to <3 mm and CDS to grades 0 or 1 as criteria. Ultrasonographic activity scores were used in 16% of studies, including the Bowel Ultrasound Score (BUSS) in two CD studies, the International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS) in one CD study, and the Milan Ultrasound Criteria (MUC) in one UC study The remaining four studies used unvalidated scores without clear definitions of response or remission. Assessment times varied, most commonly at weeks 8-16, and at 6, 12, and 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review reveals significant variability in IUS definitions of response and remission in IBD, highlighting the need to standardize eligibility criteria and outcome measures for IUS in IBD clinical trials.",Allocca M; D'Amico F; Fiorino G; Jairath V; Kucharzik T; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S,2025,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,19,2,,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaf011,"Allocca, M., D'Amico, F., Fiorino, G., Jairath, V., Kucharzik, T., Peyrin-Biroulet, L., & Danese, S.

32086718,Inflammatory bowel disease: between genetics and microbiota.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease that can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It includes two main disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). CD and UC often share a similar clinical presentation; however, they affect distinct parts of the GI Tract with a different gut wall inflammatory extent. Ultimately, IBD seems to emanate from an uncontrollably continuous inflammatory process arising against the intestinal microbiome in a genetically susceptible individual. It is a multifactorial disease stemming from the impact of both environmental and genetic components on the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, IBD genetics has gained a lot of attention. Around 200 loci were identified as imparting an increased risk for IBD. Few of them were heavily investigated and determined as highly linked to IBD. These genes, as discussed below, include NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, LRRK2, PTPN2, IL23R, Il10, Il10RA, Il10RB, CDH1 and HNF4α among others. Consequently, the incorporation of a genetic panel covering these key genes would markedly enhance the diagnosis and evaluation of IBD.",Younis N; Zarif R; Mahfouz R,2020,Molecular biology reports,47,4,3053-3063,10.1007/s11033-020-05318-5,"Younis, N., Zarif, R., & Mahfouz, R.

32801010,The Risk of Extraintestinal Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Population-based Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of developing intestinal cancer. However, less is known about the risk of extraintestinal cancers (EICs). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohorts assessing the risk of EICs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
METHODS: Only population-based studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence of EICs were included. In total, 884 studies were screened and those included were assessed for quality. Eligible studies were pooled for length of follow-up evaluation, events in the IBD population, and events or expected events in a control population for the meta-analyses.
RESULTS: In total, 40 studies were included in the systematic review and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall risk of EICs was found to be increased in both CD (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.43 [CI, 1.26, 1.63]) and UC (IRR: 1.15 [1.02, 1.31]) patients. Both CD and UC patients presented with an increased risk of skin (IRR: CD, 2.22 [1.41-3.48]; UC, 1.38 [1.12-1.71]) and hepatobiliary (IRR: CD, 2.31 [1.25-4.28]; UC, 2.05 [1.52-2.76]) malignancies. Furthermore, CD patients showed an increased risk of hematologic (IRR, 2.40 [1.81-3.18]) and lung (IRR, 1.53 [1.23-1.91]) cancers. These increased risks were present despite treatment with immunosuppressives.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that both CD and UC patients are at an increased risk of developing EICs, both overall and at specific sites. However, additional studies with longer follow-up evaluation are needed to assess the true risk of EICs posed by IBD.",Lo B; Zhao M; Vind I; Burisch J,2021,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,19,6,1117-1138.e19,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.08.015,"Lo, B., Zhao, M., Vind, I., & Burisch, J.

34872306,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in the induction and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease remission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to their special conditioning effects on the intestinal flora, but their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission is still controversial. In the present study, we analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of probiotics in IBD to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission of IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, and Weipu databases were searched for RCTs on the treatment of probiotics in IBD induction and/or maintenance of remission. Two researchers independently extracted literature data and cross-checked the extracted data. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool and the Jadad score were used to evaluate the quality of the literature. RevMan 5.20 software was used for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of ten RCTs were included, which included 777 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the clinical recurrence rate of probiotics in the CD remission phase and the control group [relative risk (RR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.06, P=0.12]. The clinical recurrence rate of UC in remission phase, the efficacy of probiotics compared with control group were not significantly different (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.80-1.42, P=0.65). The induction remission rate of UC during the active phase, the efficacy of probiotics is better than that of the control group (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09-1.98, P=0.01).
DISCUSSION: In the present study, a systematic analysis of the efficacy of probiotics in CD and UC found that probiotics can induce remission during the active period of UC, but have no obvious therapeutic advantage in maintaining CD and UC remission.",Chen M; Feng Y; Liu W,2021,Annals of palliative medicine,10,11,11821-11829,10.21037/apm-21-2996,"Chen, M., Feng, Y., & Liu, W.

36984772,Incorporation of Plant-Based Diet Surpasses Current Standards in Therapeutic Outcomes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"There has been no study of the therapeutic effect of a plant-based diet (PBD) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) except for our studies in Japan. In this review, we describe the rationale for the requirement of PBD in IBD and the outcomes of our modality incorporating PBD together with a literature review. The biggest problem in current therapy for IBD is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor in IBD. Therefore, a radical strategy against IBD has not been established. Japanese data showed an increased incidence of IBD in association with dietary westernization. Current global consumption consists of an excess of unhealthy foods and a shortage of healthy foods recognized as pro-inflammatory. Patients with IBD are no exception. One of the recommended healthy reference diets is PBD recognized as anti-inflammatory. We assert that IBD occurs in susceptible individuals mainly as a result of our omnivorous (westernized) diet. Therefore, we developed and began to provide a PBD, a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for IBD patients in 2003. Infliximab and PBD as first-line (IPF) therapy was administered for all patients with newly developed Crohn's disease (CD) and for severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Our modality broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics, with a remission rate of 96% in CD, and created a new relapse-free course in slightly over half of the patients (52%) with CD. Based on the rationale derived from available evidence and the clinical outcomes, PBD is highly recommended for IBD.",Chiba M; Morita N,2023,Metabolites,13,3,,10.3390/metabo13030332,"Chiba, M., & Morita, N.

39685485,Optimal Management of Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic and often debilitating condition requiring complex and individualized management. Over the past few decades, advancements in understanding IBD pathophysiology have led to a transformative shift in therapeutic approaches. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of IBD treatments, from early symptom-focused therapies to modern biologics, small molecule agents, and emerging treatment strategies. We discuss therapeutic goals centered on achieving clinical remission, endoscopic/mucosal healing, and enhancing patient quality of life. Additionally, we explore the rationale for the early and personalized use of biologic therapies in moderate-to-severe cases, review the current FDA-approved agents as of 2024, and highlight the advantages and limitations of these treatments. Special attention is given to the evolving role of novel oral therapies, including Janus kinase inhibitors and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and future new directions.

39345902,Artificial intelligence: A new tool in the pathologist's armamentarium for the diagnosis of IBD.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are classified into two entities, namely Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which differ in disease trajectories, genetics, epidemiological, clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological aspects. As no single golden standard modality for diagnosing IBD exists, the differential diagnosis among UC, CD, and non-IBD involves a multidisciplinary approach, considering professional groups that include gastroenterologists, endoscopists, radiologists, and pathologists. In this context, histological examination of endoscopic or surgical specimens plays a fundamental role. Nevertheless, in differentiating IBD from non-IBD colitis, the histopathological evaluation of the morphological lesions is limited by sampling and subjective human judgment, leading to potential diagnostic discrepancies. To overcome these limitations, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are emerging to enable automated analysis of medical images with advantages in accuracy, precision, and speed of investigation, increasing interest in the histological analysis of gastrointestinal inflammation. This review aims to provide an overview of the most recent knowledge and advances in AI methods, summarizing its applications in the histopathological analysis of endoscopic biopsies from IBD patients, and discussing its strengths and limitations in daily clinical practice.",Cannarozzi AL; Massimino L; Latiano A; Parigi TL; Giuliani F; Bossa F; Di Brina AL; Ungaro F; Biscaglia G; Danese S; Perri F; Palmieri O,2024,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,23,,3407-3417,10.1016/j.csbj.2024.09.003,"Cannarozzi, A.

32545154,Incidence of Prostate Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Background and objectives: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as some extra-intestinal tumors, but there are still limited data about the risk of prostate cancer (PC). To analyze if there is an increased risk of PC in patients affected by IBD, we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis. Materials and Methods: A Pubmed search of all studies comparing standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risks (RR) of PC between IBD and non IBD groups, published until March 2020 was conducted. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO. Twelve studies, mostly population studies, were included. The quality score of these studies, evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, was 7. The heterogeneity was high among the studies in which ulcerative colitis (UC) was considered separate from Crohn's disease (CD) and in the studies that considered UC and CD together (""IBD-studies""), while it was low in the studies which considered CD separate from UC. Results: The relative risk of developing PC was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.51, p = 0.007) in IBD, 1.10 (95%CI 0.98-1.25, p = 0.116) in CD, and 1.22 (95%CI 0.98-1.51, p = 0.07) in UC.

38453206,Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may experience comorbidities involving metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, this association remains controversial. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of MetS in patients with IBD and assess whether MetS is more strongly associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD).
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from their inception to July 2022.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Observational studies reporting data regarding the rate of comorbid MetS among patients with IBD and published in English.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed. Pooled prevalence, ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects models. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist were used. Heterogeneity, sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed using R (V.4.2.1).
RESULTS: 11 eligible studies involving 2501 patients were included. Of these studies, four reported MetS prevalence separately by IBD phenotype, and only one contained a non-IBD comparison group. Overall, the methodological quality of the included studies was moderate. The pooled prevalence of MetS in IBD was 19.4% (95% CI 15.1% to 23.8%), with a moderate heterogeneity (I2=51.8%, Cochrane Q statistic=12.4, p=0.053). Stratified analyses demonstrated that the aggregate estimate of comorbid MetS was significantly higher in UC than in CD (38.2% vs 13.6%, χ2=4.88, p=0.03). We found a positive association between MetS and UC compared with CD (OR=2.11, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.74, p=0.01). Additionally, four studies identified that higher age was a risk factor associated with the development of MetS.
CONCLUSIONS: MetS is not rare in IBD, especially in UC. However, longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify the relationship between IBD and MetS.

37632227,The association of ultra-processed food consumption with adult inflammatory bowel disease risk: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 4 035 694 participants.,"CONTEXT: There is an inconsistency between the results obtained from observational studies regarding intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
OBJECTIVES: A dose-response meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between UPF intake and the risk of IBD.
DATA SOURCES: Searches were performed in the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to November 2, 2022.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were available from 24 studies including a total of 4 035 694 participants from 20 countries.
DATA ANALYSIS: Risk ratios for IBD were analyzed by a random-effects model. Outcomes indicated that UPF intake was linked to an increased risk of IBD (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95%CI, 1.06-1.21; P = 0.001; I2 = 73.2%; n = 59; N = 4 035 694). This association was significant, especially for the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (RR, 1.19; 95%CI, 1.00-1.41; I2 = 78.2%; P = 0.046; n = 23; N = 2 167 160), unlike the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR = 1.11; 95%CI, 0.99-1.26; P = 0.085; I2 = 60.3%; n = 27; N = 2 167 918). Also, results revealed that each 10% enhancement in daily UPF intake was not related to the risk of IBD (RR, 1.05; 95%CI, 0.98-1.14; P = 0.168; I2 = 31.9%; n = 4) or the risk of UC (RR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.92-1.11; P = 0.876; I2 = 34.7%; n = 2) in adults. However, results suggested that for every 10% increase in daily UPF intake, there was a 19% increase in the risk of CD (RR, 1.19; 95%CI, 1.01-1.32; P = 0.021; I2 = 0.0%; n = 2) among adults. In addition, the results showed a positive linear relation between UPF intake with CD risk (Pnonlinearity = 0.431; Pdose response = 0.049) but not risk of IBD or UC.
CONCLUSION: High intake of UPFs was linked with an enhanced IBD risk, a specific risk of CD. However, conducting more observational studies among several ethnicities and using specific tools that accurately assess the amount of UPF consumption, components of UPFs, and food additives may be necessary.

38999840,Importance of Gut Microbiota in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic diseases of the digestive system with a multifactorial and not fully understood etiology. There is research suggesting that they may be initiated by genetic, immunological, and lifestyle factors. In turn, all of these factors play an important role in the modulation of intestinal microflora, and a significant proportion of IBD patients struggle with intestinal dysbiosis, which leads to the conclusion that intestinal microflora disorders may significantly increase the risk of developing IBD. Additionally, in IBD patients, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) produced by intestinal epithelial cells and dendritic cells treat intestinal bacterial antigens as pathogens, which causes a disruption of the immune response, resulting in the development of an inflammatory process. This may result in the occurrence of intestinal dysbiosis, which IBD patients are significantly vulnerable to. In this study, we reviewed scientific studies (in particular, systematic reviews with meta-analyses, being studies with the highest level of evidence) regarding the microflora of patients with IBD vs. the microflora in healthy people, and the use of various strains in IBD therapy.",Ekstedt N; Jamioł-Milc D; Pieczyńska J,2024,Nutrients,16,13,,10.3390/nu16132092,"Ekstedt, N., Jamioł-Milc, D., & Pieczyńska, J.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis about the incidence, the clinical characteristics and serological characteristics of ATIL secondary to anti-TNF agents in IBD patients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Primary outcomes were the pooled ATIL incidence rates in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. Secondary outcomes were the pooled clinical symptoms incidence rates, autoantibodies incidence rates and clinical resolution rates in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 2.5%. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in UC and CD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in IBD patients treated with IFX and ADA was 4.5% and 0.2%, respectively. The pooled arthritis, mucocutaneous symptom, myalgia and fatigue incidence rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 87.2%, 29.4%, 23.9% and 41.8%, respectively. The pooled ANA rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 97.3%. The pooled anti-dsDNA antibody rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 73.9%.
CONCLUSION: ATIL has a low prevalence in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. ATIL occurs more frequently in CD patients than in UC patients. Arthritis, fatigue and mucocutaneous lesions were found to be common symptoms of ATIL. Patients with ATIL were more likely to develop ANA and anti-dsDNA.",Dai C; Wang YN; Tian WN; Huang YH; Jiang M,2022,International immunopharmacology,112,,109269,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109269,"Dai, C., Wang, Y.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of AF in the IBD population.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases for relevant studies published up to February 2024. We used the random-effects model to pool the prevalence and incidence rates of AF among IBD patients. The subgroup analyses were performed according to the IBD type.
RESULTS: A total of twenty-five studies were included. The pooled prevalence of AF among IBD patients was 6.23 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 4.99 %-7.47 %). The incidence rate of AF among IBD patients was 3.53 % (95 % CI: 0.57 %-6.48 %). The risk of developing AF in IBD patients was 1.45 times higher than that in the general population (risk ratio [RR]: 1.45, 95 % CI: 1.21-1.73). When comparing specific IBD types to the general population, the RR was 1.35 (95 % CI: 1.11-1.64) for CD and 1.17 (95 % CI: 1.11-1.23) for UC.

36435058,Metabolomics window into the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in recent 5 years.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a kind of chronic inflammation that occurs in gastrointestinal tract, including Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Although UC and CD are associated with intestinal inflammation and epithelial damage, they are quite different. The etiology of IBD has not been fully determined, but there is extensive evidence that its pathogenesis involves environmental, genetic, immune and microbial factors. The diagnosis and treatment of IBD is challenging due to its recurrent episodes and complex evolution. Metabolomics, as a new developing technology, can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively study small metabolic molecules in samples of patients, which include stool, urine, serum, plasma and tissues, and is increasingly valued in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD. This article sums up the recent progress of metabolomics in helping to diagnose and treat IBD diseases, hoping to provide biomarkers and new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD. In addition, we present the limitations of the current study of metabolomics and highlight some solutions.",Wang J; Sun Q; Gao Y; Xiang H; Zhang C; Ding P; Wu T; Ji G,2022,International immunopharmacology,113,Pt B,109472,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109472,"Wang, J., Sun, Q., Gao, Y., Xiang, H., Zhang, C., Ding, P., Wu, T., & Ji, G.

34178115,Artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal endoscopy for inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and new horizons.,"INTRODUCTION: Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical studies, luminal gastrointestinal endoscopy has made great progress, especially in the detection and characterization of neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions. Several studies have recently shown the potential of AI-driven endoscopy for the investigation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This systematic review provides an overview of the current position and future potential of AI in IBD endoscopy.
METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed and Scopus up to 2 December 2020 using the following search terms: artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer-aided, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD). All studies on human digestive endoscopy were included. A qualitative analysis and a narrative description were performed for each selected record according to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodologies and the PRISMA statement.
RESULTS: Of 398 identified records, 18 were ultimately included. Two-thirds of these (12/18) were published in 2020 and most were cross-sectional studies (15/18). No relevant bias at the study level was reported, although the risk of publication bias across studies cannot be ruled out at this early stage. Eleven records dealt with UC, five with CD and two with both. Most of the AI systems involved convolutional neural network, random forest and deep neural network architecture. Most studies focused on capsule endoscopy readings in CD (n = 5) and on the AI-assisted assessment of mucosal activity in UC (n = 10) for automated endoscopic scoring or real-time prediction of histological disease.
DISCUSSION: AI-assisted endoscopy in IBD is a rapidly evolving research field with promising technical results and additional benefits when tested in an experimental clinical scenario. External validation studies being conducted in large and prospective cohorts in real-life clinical scenarios will help confirm the added value of AI in assessing UC mucosal activity and in CD capsule reading.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Artificial intelligence for inflammatory bowel disease endoscopy Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising technology in many areas of medicine. In recent years, AI-assisted endoscopy has been introduced into several research fields, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) endoscopy, with promising applications that have the potential to revolutionize clinical practice and gastrointestinal endoscopy.We have performed the first systematic review of AI and its application in the field of IBD and endoscopy.A formal process of paper selection and analysis resulted in the assessment of 18 records. Most of these (12/18) were published in 2020 and were cross-sectional studies (15/18). No relevant biases were reported. All studies showed positive results concerning the novel technology evaluated, so the risk of publication bias cannot be ruled out at this early stage.Eleven records dealt with UC, five with CD and two with both. Most studies focused on capsule endoscopy reading in CD patients (n = 5) and on AI-assisted assessment of mucosal activity in UC patients (n = 10) for automated endoscopic scoring and real-time prediction of histological disease.We found that AI-assisted endoscopy in IBD is a rapidly growing research field. All studies indicated promising technical results. When tested in an experimental clinical scenario, AI-assisted endoscopy showed it could potentially improve the management of patients with IBD.Confirmatory evidence from real-life clinical scenarios should be obtained to verify the added value of AI-assisted IBD endoscopy in assessing UC mucosal activity and in CD capsule reading.",Tontini GE; Rimondi A; Vernero M; Neumann H; Vecchi M; Bezzio C; Cavallaro F,2021,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,14,,17562848211017730,10.1177/17562848211017730,"Tontini, G.

37634654,Coronary artery calcium scoring for cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with higher incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Data investigating the role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in identifying subclinical atherosclerotic disease in IBD patients is scarce.
METHODS: Using data obtained from the CLARIFY registry, a prospective study of no-charge coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing at University Hospitals, we reviewed patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who underwent CAC scoring from 2014 to 2020. We investigated the concordance between CAC risk and 10-year estimated ASCVD risk by AHA/ACC pooled cohort equation using pre-established thresholds for statin prescription (CAC≥100, 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%). We additionally investigated the association between CAC, preventive therapy initiation and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).
RESULTS: A total of 369 patients with IBD were included (174 UC, 195 CD), with median age of 60 years. The median CAC score was 14.9 with no significant difference between UC and CD (P = .76). Overall, 151 (41%) had CAC of 0, 108 (29%) had CAC 1-99, 61 (17%) had CAC 100 to 399, and 49 (13%) had CAC ≥400 with no difference in CAC distribution between CD and UC (P = .17). There was no difference in median CAC between IBD or age/sex-matched controls (P = .34). Approximately half of the patients (52%) with IBD had 10-year estimated ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. Among patients with ASCVD risk <7.5% (n = 163), 29 (18%) had CAC≥100 and among patients with ASCVD risk ≥7.5% (n = 178), 102 (57%) had CAC <100. There was no difference between CAC<100 vs CAC≥100 with respect to CRP, use of immunosuppressive or amino-salicylate therapy, IBD severity or complications. CAC score (AUROC 0.67 [0.56-0.78]), but not PCE ASCVD risk (AUROC 0.60 [0.48-0.73]), was predictive of MACE. The best cut-off for CAC score was 76 (sensitivity = 60%, specificity = 69%), and was associated with 4-fold increase in MACE (Hazard Ratio 4.0 [2.0-8.1], P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Subclinical atherosclerosis, as evaluated by CAC scoring, is prevalent in patients with IBD, and is associated with cardiovascular events. Further studies are needed to understand underlying biological processes of increased atherosclerotic disease risk among adults with IBD.",Naami R; Tashtish N; Neeland IJ; Katz J; Sinh P; Nasir K; Chittajallu V; Mansoor E; Rajagopalan S; Al-Kindi S,2023,American heart journal,266,,120-127,10.1016/j.ahj.2023.08.011,"Naami, R., Tashtish, N., Neeland, I.

38764499,Origin and Function of Monocytes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic disease resulting from the interaction of various factors such as social elements, autoimmunity, genetics, and gut microbiota. Alarmingly, recent epidemiological data points to a surging incidence of IBD, underscoring an urgent imperative: to delineate the intricate mechanisms driving its onset. Such insights are paramount, not only for enhancing our comprehension of IBD pathogenesis but also for refining diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms. Monocytes, significant immune cells derived from the bone marrow, serve as precursors to macrophages (Mφs) and dendritic cells (DCs) in the inflammatory response of IBD. Within the IBD milieu, their role is twofold. On the one hand, monocytes are instrumental in precipitating the disease's progression. On the other hand, their differentiated offsprings, namely moMφs and moDCs, are conspicuously mobilized at inflammatory foci, manifesting either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory actions. The phenotypic spectrum of these effector cells, intriguingly, is modulated by variables such as host genetics and the subtleties of the prevailing inflammatory microenvironment. Notwithstanding their significance, a palpable dearth exists in the literature concerning the roles and mechanisms of monocytes in IBD pathogenesis. This review endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap. It offers an exhaustive exploration of monocytes' origin, their developmental trajectory, and their differentiation dynamics during IBD. Furthermore, it delves into the functional ramifications of monocytes and their differentiated progenies throughout IBD's course. Through this lens, we aspire to furnish novel perspectives into IBD's etiology and potential therapeutic strategies.",Liao X; Liu J; Guo X; Meng R; Zhang W; Zhou J; Xie X; Zhou H,2024,Journal of inflammation research,17,,2897-2914,10.2147/JIR.S450801,"Liao, X., Liu, J., Guo, X., Meng, R., Zhang, W., Zhou, J., Xie, X., & Zhou, H.

35403222,Use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The effect of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) use causing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has been reported in few isolated observational studies; however, pooled estimation of IBD risk has not been done. The present study was conducted to estimate the risk of IBD [Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and microscopic colitis (MC)], among H2RAs users.
METHODS: Databases such as MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to January 2021. A bibliographic search of selected articles, random search in Google Scholar and ResearchGate were also performed for any additional studies. The observational studies which assessed the incidence or risk of IBD in H2RA users published in the English language were considered. Modified Downs and Black Checklist was used for quality assessment. Two independent reviewers were involved in study selection, data extraction and quality assessment; any discrepancies were settled through consensus or by consulting a third reviewer.
RESULTS: Four studies out of 2,658 articles were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of 4 studies with 8939 participants revealed a significantly higher risk of IBD (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.70-3.02; p < 0.0001) in H2RA users compared to non-users. Similar significant relationships were observed in the subgroup analysis of adults (p < 0.0001) and paediatrics (p = 0.04). The quality of included studies was observed to be fair to good.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a significantly higher IBD risk among those who used H2RA compared to non-users both in adults and in paediatrics. Further observational studies involving large populations are required to strengthen these results and to generalize these findings.",D'sa FF; Fernandes EZ; Kesarkar SV; Swaminathan L; Kunhikatta V; Rashid M; Thunga G; Chandran VP; Nair S,2022,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,47,8,1103-1111,10.1111/jcpt.13662,"D'sa, F.

39367753,Defining mucosal healing in randomized controlled trials of inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and future perspective.,"BACKGROUND: Mucosal healing (MH) is an established treatment goal in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, various definitions of MH exist. We aimed to identify how MH is defined in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library from inception to December 2023 for phase 2 and 3 RCTs of advanced therapies in IBD.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-four studies were included, 72 in UC and 72 in CD, published between 1997 and 2023. In UC, 64% (46/72) RCTs reported MH as an endpoint. 12 definitions of MH were found, from endoscopic assessment alone (35/46; 76%) to the more recent combination of histology and endoscopy (10/46; 22%). 96% (44/46) of studies used the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore. In CD, reporting of MH lagged behind UC, with only 12% (9/72) of trials specifically defining MH as an endpoint, 7 as ""absence of ulceration,"" 2 as Simplified Endoscopic Score for CD score ≤2 or 0. Histological assessment was performed in 3 RCTs of CD. Centralized reading of endoscopy was used in 48% (35/72) of RCTs of UC and 22% (16/72) of CD. Only 1 RCT included transmural healing as an endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS: A standard definition of MH in IBD is lacking. Definitions have evolved particularly in UC, which now includes the addition of histological evaluation. Transmural healing holds promise as a future target in CD. We support a greater standardization of definitions as we expect endpoints to become increasingly stringent and multimodal with computers automating the assessment.",Parigi TL; Solitano V; Armuzzi A; Barreiro de Acosta M; Begun J; Ben-Horin S; Biedermann L; Colombel JF; Dignass A; Fumery M; Ghosh S; Kobayashi T; Louis E; Magro F; Panaccione R; Rausch A; Reinisch W; Selinger C; Jairath V; Danese S; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2024,United European gastroenterology journal,12,9,1266-1279,10.1002/ueg2.12671,"Parigi, T.

32658620,Talk about micromanaging! Role of microRNAs in intestinal barrier function.,"Defective intestinal tight-junction (TJ) barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and other inflammatory conditions of the gut. The role of microRNAs (miRNA's or miR's) has also been demonstrated in the last two decades in the pathogenesis of IBD and in the regulation of intestinal TJ barrier function. MiRNAs are noncoding regulators of gene expression at the posttranscription level that have an essential role in targeting transcripts encoding proteins of intestinal TJs and their regulators. Many miRNAs have been reported to regulate or deregulate the TJ proteins responsible for the intestinal barrier integrity and intestinal permeability. Many of those miRNAs have been reported to have essential roles in the pathogenesis of IBD. In this mini-review, we summarize the results of studies in the last three years that implicate miRNAs in the defective TJ barrier in relation to IBD. The therapeutic potential of using specific miRNAs to target the intestinal TJ barrier might be of great insight for IBD therapy.",Al-Sadi R; Engers J; Abdulqadir R,2020,American journal of physiology.

35111772,Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Portal Venous System Thrombosis in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be at risk of developing portal venous system thrombosis (PVST) with worse outcomes. This study aims to explore the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of PVST among patients with IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. All the eligible studies were divided according to the history of colorectal surgery. Only the prevalence of PVST in patients with IBD was pooled if the history of colorectal surgery was unclear. The incidence of PVST in patients with IBD after colorectal surgery was pooled if the history of colorectal surgery was clear. Prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of PVST were pooled by only a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients undergoing imaging examinations. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 36 studies with 143,659 patients with IBD were included. Among the studies where the history of colorectal surgery was unclear, the prevalence of PVST was 0.99, 1.45, and 0.40% in ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and unclassified IBD, respectively. Among the studies where all the patients underwent colorectal surgery, the incidence of PVST was 6.95, 2.55, and 3.95% in UC, CD, and unclassified IBD after colorectal surgery, respectively. Both the prevalence and incidence of PVST became higher in patients with IBD undergoing imaging examinations. Preoperative corticosteroids therapy (OR = 3.112, 95% CI: 1.017-9.525; p = 0.047) and urgent surgery (OR = 1.799, 95% CI: 1.079-2.998; p = 0.024) are significant risk factors of PVST in patients with IBD after colorectal surgery. The mortality of patients with IBD with PVST after colorectal surgery was 4.31% (34/789).
CONCLUSION: PVST is not rare, but potentially lethal in patients with IBD after colorectal surgery. More severe IBD, indicated by preoperative corticosteroids and urgent surgery, is associated with a higher risk of PVST after colorectal surgery. Therefore, screening for PVST by imaging examinations and antithrombotic prophylaxis in high-risk patients should be actively considered.

40712382,Tryptophan metabolism and the intestinal microbiota: Implications for inflammatory bowel disease.,"Tryptophan metabolism exerts a pivotal influence on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involving intestinal microbiota. Tryptophan (Trp) undergoes several metabolic processes that result in the formation of several bioactive compounds, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), kynurenine (KYN), and indole analogs, and these metabolites have significant roles in maintaining intestinal health and modulating immune function. The components and ability of the intestinal microbiota affect the metabolic balance of tryptophan, and dysbiosis may lead to disorders of tryptophan metabolism, which may exacerbate the condition of IBD. In this paper, we went over how the intestinal microbiota and tryptophan metabolism interact and the mechanism of tryptophan metabolism and its products in IBD, explored the regulatory roles of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway, immune cells, and immune factors in this regard, and proposed a strategy for the treatment of IBD based on tryptophan metabolism. We also mentioned that tryptophan metabolites exhibit distinct functions between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and vary across different stages of the disease. Looking forward to the future, in-depth study of the interaction between tryptophan metabolism and intestinal microbiota can give new ideas to the clinical management of IBD.",Hua X; Chen Y; Ding S; Fang J,2025,Microbiological research,300,,128280,10.1016/j.micres.2025.128280,"Hua, X., Chen, Y., Ding, S., & Fang, J.

36173720,Prevalence of aphthous stomatitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease after the treatment with monoclonal antibodies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, the most frequently employed therapies in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), i.e., Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or unclassified IBD (IBD-U) are monoclonal anti-TNFs and anti-integrin therapies, such as vedolizumab (VDZ). Forty-seven per cent of these patients present extra-intestinal manifestations, the second most prevalent being aphthous stomatitis (AS). The present study aims to investigate which of the two therapies is associated with a lower prevalence of AS after treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search of the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, SCOPUS, LILACS and OpenGrey databases was carried out. The criteria used were those described by the PRISMA Statement. The search was not temporarily restricted and was updated to January 2022. The quality assessment was analyzed using the JBI Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool.
RESULTS: After searching, 7 studies were included that met the established criteria. Of these, 6 analysed the prevalence of AS in CD patients and 4 in UC. A total of 1,744 patients were analysed (CD=1,477 patients; 84.69%; UC=267; 15.31%). The greatest reduction in AS prevalence was observed after anti-TNF therapy. The effect of these therapies on the prevalence of AS in patients with IBD-U could not be determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Both biologic therapies achieve a reduction in the prevalence of AS in IBD patients (CD and UC). However, the best results were obtained in patients treated with anti-TNFs, possibly because VDZ is often used in patients who do not respond adequately to previous treatment with anti-TNFs and because of its intestinal specificity.",Salgado-Peralvo AO; Montero-Alonso M; Kewalramani N; Pérez-Sayáns M; Mateos-Moreno MV; Garcillán-Izquierdo MR,2022,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",27,6,e588-e599,10.4317/medoral.25528,"Salgado-Peralvo, A.

37904677,Inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage: A Mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still unclear.
AIMS: We conducted a Mendelian randomization research and meta-analysis to explore the impact of IBD and its subtypes (Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC]) on the risk of ICH.
METHODS: Two large genome-wide association analysis studies of International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) and International Stroke Genetics Consortium as exposure (IBD, UC, and CD) and outcome (ICH) in the initial stage. IBD, CD, UC GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium were adopted for the replication phase, and ultimately, the results of the initial stage and replication phase data were combined in a meta-analysis to evaluate the causal association between IBD and its subtypes and the risk of ICH.
RESULTS: In the initial stage, we found that in the IVW (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.96, p = .01), MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.97, p = .02) and MR.RAPS (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98, p = .02) method showed that UC is associated with the risk of ICH. The causal relationship between IBD, CD, and the risk of ICH cannot be found by the IVW method. IBD and its subtypes UC, CD, and risk of ICH cannot find the presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy. In replication stage, IBD (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.94, p = .0135) related to ICH, while the IVW approach did not establish a causal link in UC and CD. The meta-analysis still indicated that UC (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93, p < .05) would lessen the risk of ICH while the causality between IBD, CD, and ICH was unable to be established.
CONCLUSION: UC was causally related to ICH, but IBD and CD are not associated with ICH.

METHODS: A systematic review of all population-based studies on cost of illness of IBD published in Embase, Medline, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Methodology of included studies was assessed and costs were adjusted to 2018 US dollars.
RESULTS: Study methodologies differed considerably, with large differences in perspective, valuation method and population. For prevalent Crohn's disease (CD) cases in the last ten years annual healthcare costs were in Asia $4417 (range $1230-$31 161); Europe $12 439 ($7694-$15 807) and North America $17 495 ($14 454-$20 535). For ulcerative colitis (UC), these were $1606 ($309-$14 572), $7224 ($3228-$9779) and $13 559 ($13 559-$13 559). The main cost driver was medication, the cost of which increased considerably between 1985 and 2018, while outpatient and inpatient costs remained stable. IBD had a negative impact on work productivity. Annual costs of absenteeism for CD and UC were in Asia (with presenteeism) $5638 ($5638-$5638) and $4828 ($4828-$4828); Europe $2660 ($641-$5277) and $2394 ($651-$5992); North America $752 ($307-$1303) and $1443 ($85-$2350).
CONCLUSION: IBD societal cost of illness is increasing, driven by growing costs of medication, and varies considerably between continents. While biologic therapy was expected to decrease inpatient costs by reducing hospitalisations and surgery, these costs have not declined.",van Linschoten RCA; Visser E; Niehot CD; van der Woude CJ; Hazelzet JA; van Noord D; West RL,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,3,234-248,10.1111/apt.16445,"van Linschoten, R.

36777955,Impact of Diet on Risk of IBD.,"Diet is an important factor influencing the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Several recent prospective cohorts have suggested various dietary factors may play a role in modifying the risk of these diseases. These include an inverse association between dietary fiber, fruit or vegetable intake and risk of CD and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and UC. In addition to macro-nutrients, dietary additives such as emulsifiers may also play a role.",Ananthakrishnan AN,2020,Crohn's & colitis 360,2,1,otz054,10.1093/crocol/otz054,"Ananthakrishnan, A. N.

36362944,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Report of a Case and Review of the Literature.,"A wide spectrum of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) can burden patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). EIMs contribute fairly to morbidity and mortality rates in IBD patients. Moreover, EIMs in IBD patients are so frequent that some suggest that IBD should be approached as a systemic disorder. Anemia is very common in IBD patients. The two most common types of anemia in IBD, iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, are extraintestinal complications. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, more frequent in ulcerative colitis (UC) than in Crohn's disease (CD). In this case-based review of the literature, we present a 36-year-old female patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and Coombs positive AIHA, complicated by pulmonary thromboembolism and successfully treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of AIHA in IBD is unclear. Treatment options for AIHA in IBD patients before biologic therapy included corticosteroids alone or in combination with azathioprine (AZA), methotrexate, and surgical treatment (colectomy and/or splenectomy). Currently, biologic therapy is a promising therapeutic option, especially in corticosteroid refractory or corticosteroid-dependent IBD patients with AIHA.",Toplicanin A; Toncev L; Matovic Zaric V; Sokic Milutinovic A,2022,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",12,11,,10.3390/life12111784,"Toplicanin, A., Toncev, L., Matovic Zaric, V., & Sokic Milutinovic, A.

38779440,The Impact of Microbiome Interventions on the Progression and Severity of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. The dysbiotic gut microbiome likely contributes to IBD pathogenesis. Microbiome-directed therapies such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and synbiotics may help induce and maintain remission. This systematic review aimed to determine the efficacy of microbiome interventions compared to standard therapy or placebo for IBD treatment. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials on microbiome interventions in IBD from inception to October 2023. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane tools. Outcomes included disease activity, endoscopy, histology, quality of life, and adverse events. A total of 18 randomized controlled trials were included. Three trials found intensive (i.e., high frequency of administration and/or large volumes of fecal material) multi-donor FMT superior to autologous FMT or glucocorticoids for UC remission induction. Seven placebo-controlled trials demonstrated higher remission rates with FMT, especially intensive protocols, versus control for mild-to-moderate UC. However, a single FMT did not prevent relapses. Seven probiotic trials showed the potential to improve UC activity and maintain remission. One synbiotic trial reported reduced inflammation and symptoms versus placebo. Serious adverse events were rare. Small sample sizes and protocol heterogeneity limited the conclusions. Current evidence indicates the potential benefits of microbiome interventions, particularly intensive multi-donor FMT, for inducing and maintaining remission in UC. Probiotics may also improve outcomes. Adequately powered trials using standardized protocols are still needed to firmly establish efficacy and safety. Microbiome-directed therapies represent a promising approach for improving IBD outcomes.",Kasapoglu M; Yadavalli R; Nawaz S; Althwanay A; AlEdani EM; Kaur H; Butt S,2024,Cureus,16,5,e60786,10.7759/cureus.60786,"Kasapoglu, M., Yadavalli, R., Nawaz, S., Althwanay, A., AlEdani, E.

38137644,Leaving behind the Mucosa: Advances and Future Directions of Intestinal Ultrasound in Ulcerative Colitis.,"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), mainly Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD), are disorders characterized by chronic inflammation with severe morbidity and long-term disabling quality of life outcomes. UC mainly affects the mucosal and sub-mucosal layers of the colon, without embracing the peri-intestinal structures. Considering the predominant mucosal location of UC inflammation, the implementation of transmural evaluation by cross-sectional imaging techniques, mainly Intestinal Ultrasound (IUS), has been left behind for ages, especially if compared to CD. Nevertheless, studies analyzing intestinal ultrasound parameters accuracy in disease activity detection reported a good-to-optimal correlation of IUS markers with colonic inflammation, suggesting comparable feasibility of IUS monitoring in UC as in CD. The easy-to-use, costless and point-of-care available status of IUS is therefore crucial in order to improve the diagnostic process and, according to the recent literature, to monitor the response to treatment leading to speeding up decision making and therapy adjustments. Recent studies have demonstrated the correlation between transmural healing in UC with favorable outcomes even in the long term. An evidence gap still exists in the assessment of the rectum, with trans-perineal ultrasound (TPUS) a potential answer to reach a more precise evaluation of rectal inflammation. Eventually, IUS is also increasingly showing promises in emergent or post-surgical UC settings, considering various efforts put in line to demonstrate its feasibility in predicting response to salvage therapy for surgery avoidance and in studying inflammation relapse after procto-colectomy with ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) creation.",Barchi A; Dal Buono A; D'Amico F; Furfaro F; Zilli A; Fiorino G; Parigi TL; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S; Allocca M,2023,Journal of clinical medicine,12,24,,10.3390/jcm12247569,"Barchi, A., Dal Buono, A., D'Amico, F., Furfaro, F., Zilli, A., Fiorino, G., Parigi, T.

35448412,Cytotoxicity of Thiopurine Drugs in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"The effectiveness of thiopurine drugs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was confirmed more than a half-century ago. It was proven that these can be essential immunomodulatory medications. Since then, they have been used routinely to maintain remission of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The cytotoxic properties of thiopurines and the numerous adverse effects of the treatment are controversial. However, the research subject of their pharmacology, therapy monitoring, and the search for predictive markers are still very relevant. In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge and findings in the field of thiopurines in IBD, focusing on the aspect of their cytotoxicity. Due to thiopurines' benefits in IBD therapy, it is expected that they will still constitute an essential part of the CD and UC treatment algorithm. More studies are still required on the modulation of the action of thiopurines in combination therapy and their interaction with the gut microbiota.",Zakerska-Banaszak O; Łykowska-Szuber L; Walczak M; Żuraszek J; Zielińska A; Skrzypczak-Zielińska M,2022,Toxics,10,4,,10.3390/toxics10040151,"Zakerska-Banaszak, O., Łykowska-Szuber, L., Walczak, M., Żuraszek, J., Zielińska, A., & Skrzypczak-Zielińska, M.

33551798,Respiratory Tract Infections in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Taking Vedolizumab: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) taking immunosuppressants or biologics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of respiratory infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with vedolizumab. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing vedolizumab to placebo in patients with IBD. Outcomes were the rate of respiratory tract infections (RTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among patients receiving vedolizumab as compared with placebo. Pooled rates were reported as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Eight RCT involving 3,287 patients (1873 CD and 1415 UC) were analyzed; 2,493 patients received vedolizumab and 794 received placebo. The rates of RTI and URTI were statistically higher in vedolizumab-treated patients compared to placebo [OR = 1.63; 95% CI (1.07-2.49); OR = 1.64 95% CI (1.07-2.53) respectively]. UC patients, but not CD patients, receiving vedolizumab had a higher risk to develop RTI and URTI [OR = 1.98; 95% CI (1.41-2.77); OR = 2.02; 95% CI (1.42-2.87)] compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of LRTI was small in both treatment groups. Data confirm the good safety profile of vedolizumab even though RTI were more frequent in patients receiving vedolizumab and the risk of URTIs was significantly higher in patients with UC.",Marafini I; Troncone E; Rocchetti I; Monteleone G,2020,Frontiers in pharmacology,11,,585732,10.3389/fphar.2020.585732,"Marafini, I., Troncone, E., Rocchetti, I., & Monteleone, G.

33978386,The Elevated Risk of Recurrent Clostridioides Difficile Infection in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the risk of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) is still controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to clarify whether the risk of rCDI is associated with IBD based on published data.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in English and Chinese databases, covering all available publications until date 01/01/2020. The statistical analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 and odds ratios (ORs) combined with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to explore the IBD-rCDI association.
RESULTS: A total of 4,417 IBD cases and 355,769 control cases in 14 independent studies from 2007 to 2019 were included. Compared with non-IBD, IBD was associated with an increased risk of rCDI (OR = 1.63, CI = 1.09 - 2.43, p = 0.02). In addition, the risk of rCDI was particularly and significantly increased in IBD patients at the young age (≤ 50, OR = 1.58, CI = 1.02 - 2.44, p = 0.04), but not in patients at the old age (> 50, OR = 2.08, CI = 0.65 - 6.61, p = 0.21). Compared with Crohn's disease (CD), no significant differences existed in the risk of rCDI in ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR = 1.22, CI = 0.81 - 1.85, p = 0.34). Additionally, the risk of rCDI was not significantly different between UC and CD, in patients receiving FMT (OR = 1.41, CI = 0.65 - 3.06, p = 0.38) or no FMT treatment (OR = 1.16, CI = 0.71 - 1.88, p = 0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of rCDI was significantly increased in IBD patients, in particular in those age below 50. Compared with CD, no significant differences of the risk of rCDI was observed in UC.",Yang X; Huang Z; He J; Chen Y,2021,Clinical laboratory,67,5,,10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200428,"Yang, X., Huang, Z., He, J., & Chen, Y.

Herein, Mendelian randomization was employed to identify the causal effect of inflammatory bowel disease on kidney function and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), urolithiasis, and IgA nephropathy.
METHODS: The International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium provided the summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data that correlates with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). GWAS data for estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine (eGFRcrea), urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR), and CKD were obtained from the CKDGen Consortium, and GWAS data for urolithiasis were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The summary-level GWAS data for IgA nephropathy were obtained from the meta-analysis of UK-biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan. Inverse-variance weighted was used as the primary estimate. Furthermore, the Steiger test was used to validate the direction of causality.
RESULTS: The inverse-variance weighted data revealed that genetically predicted UC significantly increased uACR levels, while genetically predicted CD significantly increased the risk of urolithiasis.
CONCLUSIONS: UC increases the levels of uACR, and CD increases the risk of urolithiasis.",Wu H; Liu P; Gong S; Liu X; Hill MA; Liu Z; Xu M; Xu C,2023,European journal of medical research,28,1,167,10.1186/s40001-023-01128-0,"Wu, H., Liu, P., Gong, S., Liu, X., Hill, M.

34316007,Harnessing murine models of Crohn's disease ileitis to advance concepts of pathophysiology and treatment.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both characterized by chronic inflammation and severe dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract. These two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent distinct clinical disorders with diverse driving mechanisms; however, this divergence is not reflected in currently approved therapeutics that commonly target general proinflammatory pathways. A compelling need therefore remains to understand factors that differentiate the topology and the distinct clinical manifestations of CD versus UC, in order to develop more effective and specialized therapies. Animal models provide valuable platforms for studying IBD heterogeneity and deciphering disease-specific mechanisms. Both the established and the newly developed ileitis mouse models are characterized by various disease initiating mechanisms and diverse phenotypic outcomes that reflect the complexity of human CD-ileitis. Microbial dysbiosis, destruction of epithelial barrier integrity, immune cell deregulation, as well as the recently described genome instability and stromal cell activation have all been proposed as the triggering factors for the development of ileitis-associated pathology. In this review, we aim to critically evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings of murine models of CD-ileitis, discuss their phenotypic similarities to human disease, and envisage their further exploitation for the development of novel targeted and personalized therapeutics.",Iliopoulou L; Kollias G,2022,Mucosal immunology,15,1,10-26,10.1038/s41385-021-00433-3,"Iliopoulou, L., & Kollias, G.

36556071,A Review of Ophthalmic Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune-mediated conditions caused by various polygenic and environmental factors. Clinical manifestations of IBD primarily occur in the gastrointestinal tract, but many patients are affected by extraintestinal complications, including eye diseases. Ocular disorders are the third most common extraintestinal manifestation (EIM), following musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous involvement. Episcleritis, frequently occurring in IBD patients, may be associated with exacerbation of the intestinal disease. Uveitis does not correlate with IBD activity but may be related to the presence of other EIMs, particularly erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis. Early detection and specific therapy of ocular manifestations of IBD are fundamental to avoiding sight-threatening complications. Therefore, ophthalmic evaluation should be performed in all IBD patients. Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants may be inevitable in severe cases to control ocular inflammation. Persistent and relapsing conditions usually respond well to TNF-α-inhibitors. Interdisciplinary cooperation between gastroenterologists and ophthalmologists is fundamental in initiating the appropriate treatment for patients.",Pytrus W; Akutko K; Pytrus T; Turno-Kręcicka A,2022,Journal of clinical medicine,11,24,,10.3390/jcm11247457,"Pytrus, W., Akutko, K., Pytrus, T., & Turno-Kręcicka, A.

37615427,Circulating and intestinal regulatory T cells in inflammatory bowel disease: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important immunosuppressive role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, findings on the quantitative and functional changes of intestinal and circulating Tregs in patients with IBD are rather contradictory. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis on this issue. The pooled effect was assessed using the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and subgroup analyses were performed to investigate heterogeneity. This analysis included 764 IBD (402 UC and 362 CD) patients and 341 healthy controls (HCs) pooled from 17 eligible studies. The percentage of circulating Tregs was significantly decreased in active IBD patients compared to HCs (SMD = -0.95, p < 0.001) and inactive IBD patients (SMD = -0.80, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the percentage of circulating Tregs between inactive IBD patients and HCs. The suppressive function of circulating Tregs was impaired in active IBD patients according to limited data (SMD = -0.75, p = 0.02). Besides, the percentage of intestinal Tregs was significantly higher in inflamed regions than in non-inflamed regions (SMD = 0.85, p < 0.001). Our study quantitatively summarized the quantitative and functional changes of Tregs and supported the therapeutic potential of Tregs in IBD.

39482823,Gut microbiome-targeted therapies as adjuvant treatments in inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gut microbiome-targeted therapies (MTTs), including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have been widely used in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but the best MTTs has not yet been confirmed. We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to examine this in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and safety of MTTs as adjuvant therapies for IBD until December 10, 2023. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy reported as pooled relative risks with 95% CIs, and interventions ranked according to means of surfaces under cumulative ranking values.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Firstly, we compared the efficacy of MTTs in IBD patients. Only FMT and probiotics were superior to placebo in all outcomes, but FMT ranked best in improving clinical response rate and clinical and endoscopic remission rate, and probiotics ranked second in reducing clinical relapse rate showed significant efficacy, while prebiotics ranked first showed nonsignificant efficacy. Subsequently, we conducted NMA for specific MTT formulations in UC and CD separately, which revealed that FMT, especially combined FMT via colonoscopy and enema, showed significant efficacy and was superior in improving clinical response and remission rate of active UC patients. As for endoscopic remission and clinical relapse, multistrain probiotics based on specific genera of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium showed significant efficacy and ranked best in UC. In CD, we found that no MTTs were significantly better than placebo, but synbiotics comprising Bifidobacterium and fructo-oligosaccharide/inulin mix and Saccharomyces ranked best in improving clinical remission and reducing clinical relapse, respectively. Moreover, FMT was safe in both UC and CD.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT and multistrain probiotics showed superior efficacy in UC. However, the efficacy of MTTs varies among different IBD subtypes and disease stages; thus, the personalized treatment strategies of MTTs are necessary.",Zhang T; Li X; Li J; Sun F; Duan L,2025,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,40,1,78-88,10.1111/jgh.16795,"Zhang, T., Li, X., Li, J., Sun, F., & Duan, L.

36322700,Fertility and Assisted Reproductive Technologies Outcomes of Women with Non-surgically Managed Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: In view of their frequent onset during childbearing years, the impact of inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] on reproductive health is of important concern to young women and to the IBD physician. This study aims to assess the fertility and assisted reproductive technologies outcomes in non-surgically treated IBD females.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE [until March 2022] to identify studies assessing fertility and assisted reproductive technologies outcomes in women with non-operated IBD, compared with non-IBD patients. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted study data.
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies encompassing 18 012 patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] and 14 353 patients with Crohn's disease [CD] were included for analysis. The fertility rate in UC patients and in the general population was comparable, but UC patients tended to have fewer children, mainly by choice. On the contrary, the fertility of CD patients appeared to be reduced. Although a deliberate component cannot be not excluded, the disease itself could affect fertility. Disease activity was associated with reduced fertility in both UC and CD patients. In CD, the colonic involvement of the disease and perianal damage could be associated with subfertility, but data are less consistent. According to the only study reporting the assisted reproductive technologies outcomes, pregnancy rates after in vitro fertilization in subfertile non-operated UC patients and non-IBD patients were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: There is low-quality evidence from observational studies that patients with CD and relapsing UC may have impaired fertility. After assisted reproductive technologies, pregnancy rates of subfertile non-operated UC patients were similar to those of the general population, although this observation requires further scrutiny in larger studies that should include UC and CD patients.",Vieujean S; De Vos M; Paridaens K; Daftary GS; Danese S; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,4,614-632,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac170,"Vieujean, S., De Vos, M., Paridaens, K., Daftary, G.

Modern pharmacological studies indicate that AMS and its constituents exhibit multiple bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, immune regulatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, expectorant, and diuretic effects. AMS and its active constituents, which have been reported to be effective in IBD treatment, are believed to be viable candidate drugs for IBD treatment. These underlying mechanisms are associated with anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, immunomodulation, intestinal epithelial repair, gut microbiota homeostasis, and improved energy metabolism. In this review, we summarize the efficacy and underlying mechanisms involved in IBD treatment with AMS and its active constituents in preclinical studies.",Hou M; Leng Y; Shi Y; Tan Z; Min X,2023,The American journal of Chinese medicine,51,6,1501-1526,10.1142/S0192415X23500684,"Hou, M., Leng, Y., Shi, Y., Tan, Z., & Min, X.

32180822,Vedolizumab in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: evolving paradigms.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases, comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic, relapsing and remitting immune-mediated inflammatory diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Vedolizumab is the first licensed drug in a group of 'gut-selective' biological agents used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. The GEMINI registrational trials established the efficacy of vedolizumab for the induction and maintenance of remission in both CD and UC, with the most favourable results in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-antagonist-naive patients. In recent years, a wealth of 'real-world' data has emerged supporting positive clinical, endoscopic and histological outcomes in patients treated with vedolizumab (VDZ) as well as reassuring safety data. More recently, the results of the first head-to-head trials of VDZ and TNF antagonists have been reported, as well as the results of a number of studies exploring the role of therapeutic drug monitoring with VDZ. This review brings together data reported on VDZ to date, including from the GEMINI trials, real-world data and emerging studies regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and immunogenicity. The safety profile of VDZ is also reviewed. Evolving treatment paradigms are explored, including data regarding the role of VDZ in perianal CD, post-operative complications and recurrence, extraintestinal manifestations and pregnancy.",Crooks B; Barnes T; Limdi JK,2020,Drugs in context,9,,,10.7573/dic.2019-10-2,"Crooks, B., Barnes, T., & Limdi, J.

35300073,User's guide to JAK inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are remitting and relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, highlighted by the dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, which lead to mucosal damage. These conditions cause a significant burden worldwide as primary and secondary treatment failure rates remain high even with our current therapeutic options. This emphasizes the need for continued advancement in treatment efficacy with improved safety profiles. Novel disease-targeting therapeutics have been developed, most recently being the Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi). JAKi serve as a promising new class of non-immunogenic small molecule inhibitors that modulate inflammatory pathways by blocking the critical role that Janus kinase (JAK) proteins play in mediating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Tofacitinib has been shown to be therapeutically efficacious, to have a tolerable safety profile, and to be available for adult patients with moderate-to-severe UC. This review was designed to serve as an overview and as practical guidance for medical practitioners.

30680455,"Dietary intake of fish, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.","PURPOSE: Fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.
RESULTS: 12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative colitis (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α-Linolenic acid (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62).

32138832,Risk of pancreatitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease - a meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are believed to be at increased risk of pancreatitis. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between IBD and risk of pancreatitis in a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in the PubMed and Embase databases. Data were extracted using predefined data fields, and risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Four studies with acute pancreatitis as outcome met the eligibility criteria. The overall estimated risk ratio revealed an increased risk for acute pancreatitis in patients with IBD of 2.78 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.40-3.22). The risk ratio was increased for both CD and UC, with estimated risk ratios of 3.62 (95% CI: 2.99-4.38) and 2.24 (95% CI: 1.85-2.71), respectively. No studies meeting the eligibility criteria had chronic pancreatitis as outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of acute pancreatitis is increased in patients with IBD and higher for patients with CD. Due to the observational design of the studies included in our meta-analysis, the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of pancreatitis are unknown and remain to be investigated. Studies of the risk of chronic pancreatitis among patients with IBD are warranted.

38159083,The Epidemiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Oceania: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Incidence and Prevalence.,"BACKGROUND: Past studies have shown high rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Australia and New Zealand (NZ). We aimed to describe the epidemiology of IBD in Australia, NZ, and the surrounding region (collectively termed Oceania) by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2023 for studies reporting incidence or prevalence rates of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) in Oceania. All study designs were included. A meta-analysis calculated pooled estimates of incidence and prevalence, and a sensitivity analysis compared the pooled population-based studies with the non-population-based studies and the Australian and NZ studies separately.
RESULTS: Nineteen incidence and 11 prevalence studies were included; 2 studies were from the Pacific Islands, with the rest coming from Australia and NZ. Pooled estimates showed high incidence rates of 19.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8-23.7) for IBD, 8.3 (95% CI, 6.9-9.8) for CD, and 7.4 (95% CI, 5.7-9.1) for CD per 100 000 person-years. CD was more common than UC in most studies. The pooled estimates for the prevalence studies were 303.3 (95% CI, 128.1-478.4) for IBD, 149.8 (95% CI, 71.0-228.5) for CD, and 142.2 (95% CI, 63.1-221.4) for UC per 100 000 persons. Studies using population-based data collection methods showed higher pooled rates for both incidence and prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of IBD in Oceania is high. The studies were heterogeneous and there were several geographic areas with no information, highlighting the need for more epidemiological studies of IBD.",Forbes AJ; Frampton CMA; Day AS; Kaplan GG; Gearry RB,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,11,2076-2086,10.1093/ibd/izad295,"Forbes, A.

32784952,New Insights into Inflammatory Bowel Diseases from Proteomic and Lipidomic Studies.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) represent the two main forms of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The exact IBD etiology is not yet revealed but CD and UC are likely induced by an excessive immune response against normal constituents of the intestinal microbial flora. IBD diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms often combined with invasive and costly procedures. Thus, the need for more non-invasive markers is urgent. Several routine laboratory investigations have been explored as indicators of intestinal inflammation in IBD, including blood testing for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and specific antibodies, in addition to stool testing for calprotectin and lactoferrin. However, none has been universally adopted, some have been well-characterized, and others hold great promise. In recent years, the technological developments within the field of mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics have greatly enhanced the ability to retrieve, characterize, and analyze large amounts of data. High-throughput research allowed enhancing the understanding of the biology of IBD permitting a more accurate biomarker discovery than ever before. In this review, we summarize currently used IBD serological and stool biomarkers and how proteomics and lipidomics are contributing to the identification of IBD biomarkers.",Longo S; Chieppa M; Cossa LG; Spinelli CC; Greco M; Maffia M; Giudetti AM,2020,Proteomes,8,3,,10.3390/proteomes8030018,"Longo, S., Chieppa, M., Cossa, L.

34722717,Optimal Range of Fecal Calprotectin for Predicting Mucosal Healing in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a promising marker for assessment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity. However, the utility of FC for predicting mucosal healing (MH) of IBD patients has yet to be clearly demonstrated. The objective of our study was to perform a meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of FC in predicting MH of IBD patients.
METHODS: We systematically searched the databases for studies from inception to April 2020 that evaluated MH in IBD. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. The extracted data were pooled using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve model. Random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies comprising 1,682 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 4 studies comprising 221 Crohn's disease (CD) patients were included. The best performance of FC for predicting MH in UC was at cut-off range of 60-75 μg/g with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values of cutoff range 180-250 μg/g for predicting MH in CD were 0.67 and 0.76, respectively. The AUC of 0.79 also revealed improved discrimination for identifying MH in CD with FC concentration.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis has found that FC is a simple, reliable noninvasive marker for predicting MH in IBD patients. FC cutoff range 60-75 μg/g appears to have the best overall accuracy in UC patients.",Xiang BJ; Jiang M; Sun MJ; Dai C,2021,Visceral medicine,37,5,338-348,10.1159/000514196,"Xiang, B.

39777137,Hepatobiliary and pancreatic manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), can affect the hepatobiliary system and pancreas, substantially impacting the life quality of patients.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the quality of evidence and comprehensively assess the validity of associations of IBD with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases.
DESIGN: We performed an umbrella review of existing meta-analyses in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations.
DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to April 2024, to identify and appraise meta-analyses examining IBD and risk of hepatobiliary and pancreatic manifestations. Methodologic quality was assessed with A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) and the strength of evidence was graded according to prespecified criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 14 meta-analyses of observational studies were included. The strongest-validity evidence suggested the significant associations between IBD and risk of gallstones (odds ratio (OR) = 1.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40-2.12) and acute pancreatitis (OR = 3.11; 95% CI = 2.93-3.30). Highly suggestive evidence indicated a significantly increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer in UC (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.52-2.76) and CD (IRR = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.25-4.28). In addition, highly suggestive evidence indicated that IBD was associated with portal venous system thrombosis. Suggestive evidence showed a significantly higher prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and autoimmune pancreatitis in IBD patients than in the general population.
CONCLUSION: The associations between IBD and multiple hepatobiliary and pancreatic disorders showed varying levels of evidence and magnitude of risk. Further high-quality primary studies are needed to identify IBD patients who are more at risk and would benefit the most from screening and prevention programs.

Dietary fiber and its major sources can influence the risk of IBD by modulation of the gut microbiota. This study summarizes findings from published cohort studies on the association between dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable consumption and risk of IBD. Relevant articles published up to January 2019 were searched via PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. All prospective cohort studies investigating the association between dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake and risk of IBD were included. Combining 7 effect sizes from 6 studies, no significant association was found between dietary intake of fiber and risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.34). However, a significant inverse association was found between dietary fiber intake and risk of Crohn disease (CD) (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.74), based on 5 studies with 6 effect sizes. Pooling information from 4 studies, we found a significant protective association between dietary intake of fruit and risk of UC (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.86) and CD (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.58). We also found a significant inverse association between vegetable consumption and risk of UC (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.66) and CD (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.59). In conclusion, dietary intake of fruit and vegetables was inversely associated with risk of IBD and its subtypes. Dietary fiber intake was also inversely associated with incidence of IBD and CD, but not with UC.

37298350,Exploring the Impact of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside on Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Investigating New Mechanisms for Emerging Interventions.,"Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), the most widely distributed anthocyanin (ACN) in edible fruits, has been proposed for several bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, antimicrobial, anti-viral, anti-thrombotic and epigenetic actions. However, habitual intake of ACNs and C3G may vary widely among populations, regions, and seasons, among individuals with different education and financial status. The main point of C3G absorption occurs in the small and large bowel. Therefore, it has been supposed that the treating properties of C3G might affect inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). IBDs develop through complex inflammatory pathways and sometimes may be resistant to conventional treatment strategies. C3G presents antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and antimicrobial effects useful for IBD management. In particular, different studies have demonstrated that C3G inhibits NF-κB pathway activation. In addition, C3G activates the Nrf2 pathway. On the other hand, it modulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes and cytoprotective proteins, such as NAD(P)H, superoxide dismutase, heme-oxygenase (HO-1), thioredoxin, quinone reductase-oxide 1 (NQO1), catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. Interferon I and II pathways are downregulated by C3G inhibiting interferon-mediating inflammatory cascades. Moreover, C3G reduces reactive species and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as C reactive protein, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-17A in UC and CD patients. Finally, C3G modulates gut microbiota by inducing an increase in beneficial gut bacteria and increasing microbial abundances, thus mitigating dysbiosis. Thus, C3G presents activities that may have potential therapeutic and protective actions against IBD. Still, in the future, clinical trials should be designed to investigate the bioavailability of C3G in IBD patients and the proper therapeutic doses through different sources, aiming to the standardization of the exact clinical outcome and efficacy of C3G.",Frountzas M; Karanikki E; Toutouza O; Sotirakis D; Schizas D; Theofilis P; Tousoulis D; Toutouzas KG,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,11,,10.3390/ijms24119399,"Frountzas, M., Karanikki, E., Toutouza, O., Sotirakis, D., Schizas, D., Theofilis, P., Tousoulis, D., & Toutouzas, K.

37627565,Role of Hydrogen Sulfide in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), originally known as toxic gas, has now attracted attention as one of the gasotransmitters involved in many reactions in the human body. H2S has been assumed to play a role in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, of which the exact pathogenesis remains unknown. One of them is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic intestinal disease subclassified as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Any change in the amount of H2S seems to be linked to inflammation in this illness. These changes can be brought about by alterations in the microbiota, in the endogenous metabolism of H2S and in the diet. As both too little and too much H2S drive inflammation, a balanced level is needed for intestinal health. The aim of this review is to summarize the available literature published until June 2023 in order to provide an overview of the current knowledge of the connection between H2S and IBD.",Stummer N; Feichtinger RG; Weghuber D; Kofler B; Schneider AM,2023,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",12,8,,10.3390/antiox12081570,"Stummer, N., Feichtinger, R.

35010879,Nutritional Therapies and Their Influence on the Intestinal Microbiome in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with numerous genetic and environmental risk factors. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) often demonstrate marked disruptions of their gut microbiome. The intestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by diet. The association between the increasing incidence of IBD worldwide and increased consumption of a westernized diet suggests host nutrition may influence the progression or treatment of IBD via the microbiome. Several nutritional therapies have been studied for the treatment of CD and UC. While their mechanisms of action are only partially understood, existing studies do suggest that diet-driven changes in microbial composition and function underlie the diverse mechanisms of nutritional therapy. Despite existing therapies for IBD focusing heavily on immune suppression, nutrition is an important treatment option due to its superior safety profile, potentially low cost, and benefits for growth and development. These benefits are increasingly important to patients. In this review, we will describe the clinical efficacy of the different nutritional therapies that have been described for the treatment of CD and UC. We will also describe the effects of each nutritional therapy on the gut microbiome and summarize the strength of the literature with recommendations for the practicing clinician.",Hart L; Verburgt CM; Wine E; Zachos M; Poppen A; Chavannes M; Van Limbergen J; Pai N,2021,Nutrients,14,1,,10.3390/nu14010004,"Hart, L., Verburgt, C.

33918207,Curcumin and Its Modified Formulations on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): The Story So Far and Future Outlook.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder of the small intestine and colon. IBD includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and it is a major factor for the development of colon cancer, referred to as colitis-associated cancer (CAC). The current treatment of IBD mainly includes the use of synthetic drugs and monoclonal antibodies. However, these drugs have side effects over long-term use, and the high relapse rate restricts their application. In the recent past, many studies had witnessed a surge in applying plant-derived products to manage various diseases, including IBD. Curcumin is a bioactive component derived from a rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa). Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies show that curcumin may interact with many cellular targets (NF-κB, JAKs/STATs, MAPKs, TNF-γ, IL-6, PPARγ, and TRPV1) and effectively reduce the progression of IBD with promising results. Thus, curcumin is a potential therapeutic agent for patients with IBD once it significantly decreases clinical relapse in patients with quiescent IBD. This review aims to summarize recent advances and provide a comprehensive picture of curcumin's effectiveness in IBD and offer our view on future research on curcumin in IBD treatment.",Karthikeyan A; Young KN; Moniruzzaman M; Beyene AM; Do K; Kalaiselvi S; Min T,2021,Pharmaceutics,13,4,,10.3390/pharmaceutics13040484,"Karthikeyan, A., Young, K.

37748580,Fundamental crosstalk between circadian rhythm and the intestine in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the main representatives of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract mediated by the immune system. The pathogenesis of IBD is still not fully clarified. Currently, several studies have reported that circadian abnormality has profound effects on the immune system and intestinal microflora. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted that immune function and intestinal microbiota are two major factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the role of the circadian rhythm in relation to IBD is relatively less understood and largely unexplored. The aim of this review is to present the current state of knowledge about the relationship between circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disturbance, and IBD to analyze the possibility of employing this knowledge in IBD diagnosis and treatment.",Zhang C; Liu X,2023,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,47,9,102214,10.1016/j.clinre.2023.102214,"Zhang, C., & Liu, X.

35306546,Probiotics in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Adulthood: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by chronic uncontrolled inflammation with an increasing prevalence in western countries. Standard medications are often associated with adverse side effects. Thus, alternative therapies such as probiotic treatment are of great interest. We aimed to review the effect of probiotics in IBD patients.
METHODS: A systematic search strategy was carried out in PubMed in June 2021 and 22 studies published from 1997 to 2019 were included; they analyzed the influence of probiotics in adult IBD patients both in active and inactive stage of disease.
RESULTS: Probiotic treatment in CD patients had no effect in 6 of 7 studies. Only in one study a positive effect of an adjunctive probiotic treatment next to standard treatment in CD patients was reported. In patients with active UC, a combination of standard treatment with probiotics resulted in improvement of the disease in 5 of 9 studies. Three of 7 studies among UC patients in remission demonstrated that probiotic treatment could be as effective as standard treatment. No clear evidence was found in studies comparing probiotics to placebo in inactive UC patients with ongoing standard medication.
CONCLUSION: There is no clear evidence of the benefit of probiotic treatment in CD patients. In contrast, combining standard treatment with probiotics might be an option to achieve remission in active UC patients.",Lorentz A; Müller L,2022,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,31,1,74-84,10.15403/jgld-3936,"Lorentz, A., & Müller, L.

40507107,The Association Between Fast Food Consumption and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Case-Control Study and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic conditions influenced by various factors, including diet. This study examined the association between fast food consumption and IBD risk through a case-control study and a meta-analysis of epidemiological evidence. Methods: We analyzed data from a hospital-based case-control study conducted in Riyadh. The study included 158 UC patients, 244 CD patients, and 395 controls without IBD. Fast food consumption was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire distributed before diagnoses were made. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of UC and CD for individuals who reported daily fast food consumption. Then, we merged our results with those from other studies investigating the same association into a meta-analysis. Results: In the case-control study, daily consumption of fast food was strongly associated with UC and CD among Saudi people: age- and sex-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) = 6.29 (3.89, 10.16) and 5.92 (3.98, 8.80), respectively. The associations remained robust after further adjustments: ORs (95% CIs) = 6.61 (3.93, 11.12) and 5.90 (3.89, 8.94), respectively. Similarly, the meta-analysis revealed higher odds of fast food intake associated with UC and CD, with pooled odds ratios (95% CIs) of 2.41 (1.07, 5.45) and 2.65 (1.23, 5.70), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential role of fast food consumption in the development of IBD. From a preventive medicine perspective, fast food consumption should be discouraged to reduce the risk of IBD.",Almofarreh A; Sheerah HA; Arafa A; AlBassam AM; Alassaf MA; AlBassam FM; Alsaif FB; Alkwai KM; Alzahrani FA; Allift MA; AlBassam S; AlBassam A; Alshehri M; Alshammari KO; Alenezi NM; Alamri FA,2025,Nutrients,17,11,,10.3390/nu17111838,"Almofarreh, A., Sheerah, H.

39355844,Cross-talk between macrophages and gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: a dynamic interplay influencing pathogenesis and therapy.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a group of chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders. The etiology of IBD is multifactorial, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and a complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the host's immune system. Intestinal resident macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis and progress of IBD, as well as in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and facilitating tissue repair. This review delves into the intricate relationship between intestinal macrophages and gut microbiota, highlighting their pivotal roles in IBD pathogenesis. We discuss the impact of macrophage dysregulation and the consequent polarization of different phenotypes on intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, we explore the compositional and functional alterations in gut microbiota associated with IBD, including the emerging significance of fungal and viral components. This review also examines the effects of current therapeutic strategies, such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), antibiotics, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, on gut microbiota and macrophage function. We underscore the potential of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and probiotics as innovative approaches to modulate the gut microbiome in IBD. The aim is to provide insights into the development of novel therapies targeting the gut microbiota and macrophages to improve IBD management.",Ning S; Zhang Z; Zhou C; Wang B; Liu Z; Feng B,2024,Frontiers in medicine,11,,1457218,10.3389/fmed.2024.1457218,"Ning, S., Zhang, Z., Zhou, C., Wang, B., Liu, Z., & Feng, B.

33245900,Statin use and new-onset of inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of over ten million participants.,"Statin therapy is used ubiquitously to reduce cholesterol levels, and recent studies have revealed statin use may be associated with a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A comprehensive assessment of the literature was performed to investigate whether statin use may influence the risk of new-onset IBD. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus online databases, for articles published up to July 31, 2020. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used. We identified five retrospective studies, with seven arms, comprising >10 million participants, consisting of 89,324 cases of IBD (statin users: 14,494 versus non-users: 74,830) detected during a mean follow-up of 8.6 years. Overall, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of new-onset IBD (HR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.06; P = 0.129, I2 = 81.3%). Pooled results indicated a non-significant reduced risk of new-onset CD (HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.25; P = 0.684, I2 = 85.9%) and new-onset UC (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.12; P = 0.306, I2 = 92.5%) with statin use. Statin use may confer a protective effect in reducing the risk of new-onset IBD.

35911403,Diagnostic Utility of Non-invasive Tests for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Umbrella Review.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to consolidate evidence from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the diagnostic performances of non-invasive tests for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in various clinical conditions and age groups.
METHODS: Two independent reviewers systematically identified and appraised systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the diagnostic utility of non-invasive tests for IBD. Each association was categorized as adults, children, and mixed population, based on the age ranges of patients included in the primary studies. We classified clinical scenarios into diagnosis, activity assessment, and predicting recurrence.
RESULTS: In total, 106 assessments from 43 reviews were included, with 17 non-invasive tests. Fecal calprotectin (FC) and fecal lactoferrin (FL) were the most sensitive for distinguishing IBD from non-IBD. However, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and FL were the most specific for it. FC and FL were the most sensitive and specific tests, respectively, to distinguish IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), IgA, were the best test to distinguish Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis (UC). Interferon-γ release assay was the best test to distinguish CD from intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) were both sensitive and specific for disease activity, along with the high sensitivity of FC. Small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) had the highest sensitivity, and FC had the highest specificity for operative CD recurrence.
CONCLUSION: In this umbrella review, we summarized the diagnostic performance of non-invasive tests for IBD in various clinical conditions and age groups. Clinicians can use the suggested non-invasive test depending on the appropriate clinical situation in IBD patients.",Shi JT; Zhang Y; She Y; Goyal H; Wu ZQ; Xu HG,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,920732,10.3389/fmed.2022.920732,"Shi, J.

38937216,"Bariatric surgery in inflammatory bowel disease: a comparative analysis of 450,000 patients.","BACKGROUND: Studies were conducted to investigate the outcomes of bariatric surgery (BS) among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze previous literature, comparing the outcomes of BS between IBD and non-IBD patients.
SETTING: Not applicable.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched on 25/9/2023 for comparative studies on outcomes of BS in IBD patients. RevMan Software v5.4 was used to conduct the analysis.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed an insignificant difference in the change of body mass index (BMI) at 1-year post-BS between IBD and non-IBD patients. IBD patients had a higher risk of acute renal failure, hemorrhage, and readmission following BS (RR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.55-3, RR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.22-2.04, RR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.17-2.08, respectively). No significant difference was observed between both groups regarding wounds, leak/intra-abdominal infection, thromboembolic complications, and bowel obstruction. A higher incidence of postoperative complications was seen among IBD patients undergoing RYGB compared with SG (RR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.43-3.41). There was a significant decline in steroid use following BS in IBD patients (RR: .67, 95% CI: .53-.84). Comparison between UC and Crohn's disease (CD) revealed insignificant differences in treatment escalation or de-escalation. Both IBD and non-IBD patients had similar lengths of hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: BS is equally effective in IBD and non-IBD patients in terms of weight loss at 1-year follow-up. Nevertheless, IBD patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, micronutrient deficiency, and readmission. Both UC and CD reported a decline in steroid use following surgery without a preferential advantage to a particular IBD sub-type.",Dean YE; Mohamed MI; Nassar M; Almadani Y; Soliman Z; Tarek N; Zein M; Yakout A; Hamza A; Elnemr MM; Abdelbaki TN,2024,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,20,11,1119-1129,10.1016/j.soard.2024.05.008,"Dean, Y.

39507607,The Current Role of Imaging in the Diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Detection of Its Complications: A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses complex gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, primarily Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), requiring precise imaging for effective diagnosis and management of complications. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current role of imaging modalities in diagnosing IBD and detecting related complications. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We performed a literature search using text words and controlled vocabulary applying Boolean operators ""AND,"" ""OR,"" with various combinations on databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The search targeted open-access articles involving humans, with full-text available, and published in the English Language from 2005 to 2024. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (RoB) checklist. Our search process identified 127 records from Cochrane (39), Embase (29), and PubMed (59). After removing 98 irrelevant records, 29 underwent further screening. Five were excluded as they involved irrelevant problems or outcomes, leaving us with 24 reports with full text, all of which were accessible. Following the eligibility assessment, two more reports were excluded due to inaccessibility, and 22 studies were included in the final analysis. The risk of bias and methodological quality assessment revealed that out of 22 studies analyzed, five (23%) had a high risk of bias, while 13 (59%) were classified as moderate risk, and four (18%) showed low risk. This distribution highlights a predominance of moderate-risk studies in research on imaging in IBD, emphasizing the need for enhanced study designs in future investigations. Our findings revealed the varying effectiveness of imaging modalities in diagnosing complications of CD and UC. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) stands out as the preferred method for CD due to its high sensitivity and noninvasive nature. In contrast, colonoscopy remains the gold standard for UC, providing direct visualization of mucosal lesions. While techniques like ultrasound and capsule endoscopy offer valuable insights, they have limitations that may affect their utility in certain cases.",Younis MY; Khan MU; Khan U; Latif Khan T; Mukarram H; Jain K; Ilyas I; Jain W,2024,Cureus,16,11,e73134,10.7759/cureus.73134,"Younis, M.

35214702,The Gut Microbiome in Psoriasis and Crohn's Disease: Is Its Perturbation a Common Denominator for Their Pathogenesis?,"Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are interlinked. In fact, the prevalence of IBD is higher in patients with psoriasis, with a risk of ulcerative colitis of 1.6-times higher than in the general population. Analogously, patients with psoriasis have a greater risk of developing IBD. Furthermore, they share some clinical features and pathogenic mechanisms. Both are chronic inflammatory diseases with a relapsing-remitting condition that persists for the patient's whole life and exhibit increased permeability of the mucosal barrier of skin and gut, allowing an increased interaction of pathogens with inflammatory receptors of the immune cells. A key element in the pathogenesis of these diseases is represented by the microbiota; in particular, the gut microbiota is an important driver of CD pathogenesis, while in psoriasis changes in gut and skin microbiota have been described without a defined pathogenic function. Furthermore, genetic predispositions or environmental factors contribute to disease manifestation, with a central role attributed to the immune responses and, in particular, to a dysregulated role played by T helper 17 cells both in psoriasis and IBD. The purpose of this review was to summarize present information about the links between psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, in particular Crohn's disease, and changes in gut and/or skin microbiome.",De Francesco MA; Caruso A,2022,Vaccines,10,2,,10.3390/vaccines10020244,"De Francesco, M.

40196017,Curcumin for the clinical treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), presents complex challenges in management due to dysregulated immune responses and genetic predispositions. This study explored the potential of curcumin as an adjunctive therapy in IBD, assessing its efficacy and safety through a systematic review of clinical trials to enhance treatment strategies and outcomes.
METHODS: To identify placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials on curcumin treatment in IBD, databases such as Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar were searched till May 2024. Inclusion criteria focused on RCTs comparing curcumin with placebo in IBD patients, with data extraction and analysis conducted using established methodologies and tools for comprehensive synthesis and assessment of study findings.
RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, 13 placebo-controlled RCTs on curcumin treatment in IBD were included after screening 362 records and conducting a full-text review. Most trials focused on UC patients and were published post-2010, utilizing oral curcumin with varying dosages and durations. The analysis showed curcumin's significant efficacy in achieving clinical remission and response in UC patients, with heterogeneity observed. Adverse events and withdrawal rates did not significantly differ between curcumin and placebo groups. In CD patients, curcumin did not show superiority over placebo for clinical and endoscopic remission.
CONCLUSION: The findings highlight curcumin's potential as a treatment for UC but indicate inconclusive results for CD, emphasizing the need for further research. The multifaceted mechanisms of curcumin's efficacy in IBD involve anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, microbiota modulatory, and immune-regulating properties. Further research is warranted to enhance understanding and treatment efficacy.

34201630,Role of Intestinal Ultrasound in the Management of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) has gained popularity as a first line technique for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) due to its many advantages. It is a non-invasive imaging technique with non-ionizing radiation exposure. It can be easily performed not only by radiologists but also by trained gastroenterologists at outpatient clinics. In addition, the cost of IUS equipment is low when compared with other imaging techniques. IUS is an accurate technique to detect inflammatory lesions and complications in the bowel in patients with suspected or already known Crohn's disease (CD). Recent evidence indicates that IUS is a convenient and accurate technique to assess extension and activity in the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and can be a non-invasive alternative to endoscopy. In patients with IBD, several non-specific pathological ultrasonographic signs can be identified: bowel wall thickening, alteration of the bowel wall echo-pattern, loss of bowel stratification, increased vascularization, decreased bowel peristalsis, fibro-fatty proliferation, enlarged lymph nodes, and/or abdominal free fluid. Considering the transmural CD inflammation, CD complications such as presence of strictures, fistulae, or abscesses can be detected. In patients with UC, where inflammation is limited to mucosa, luminal inflammatory ultrasonographic changes are similar to those of CD. As the technique is related to the operator's experience, adequate IUS training, performance in daily practice, and a generalized use of standardized parameters will help to increase its reproducibility.",Jauregui-Amezaga A; Rimola J,2021,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",11,7,,10.3390/life11070603,"Jauregui-Amezaga, A., & Rimola, J.

34884737,Gastrointestinal Dopamine in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: an increased prevalence of gastro-duodenal ulceration was described almost sixty years ago as prodromal to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, while duodenal ulcers have been rarely diagnosed in patients with schizophrenia. The cytoprotective role of dopamine in animal models of gastrointestinal ulcerations has also been described. Interestingly, Parkinson's disease (PD) might share common pathophysiological links with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as epidemiological and genetic links already suggest. Thus, the aim of our study was to review the existing literature on the role of the gastrointestinal dopaminergic system in IBD pathogenesis and progression.
METHODS: a systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA methodology.
RESULTS: twenty-four studies satisfied the predetermined criteria and were included in our qualitative analysis. Due to different observations (cross-sectional studies) as well as experimental setups and applied methodologies (in vivo and in vitro studies) a meta-analysis could not be performed. No ongoing clinical trials with dopaminergic compounds in IBD patients were found.
CONCLUSIONS: the impairment of the dopaminergic system seems to be a significant, yet underestimated, feature of IBD, and more in-depth observational studies are needed to further support the existing preclinical data.",Kurnik-Łucka M; Pasieka P; Łączak P; Wojnarski M; Jurczyk M; Gil K,2021,International journal of molecular sciences,22,23,,10.3390/ijms222312932,"Kurnik-Łucka, M., Pasieka, P., Łączak, P., Wojnarski, M., Jurczyk, M., & Gil, K.

38418774,Artificial intelligence in endoscopy related to inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In spite of rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in digestive endoscopy in lesion detection and characterization, the role of AI in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) endoscopy is not clearly defined. We aimed at systematically reviewing the role of AI in IBD endoscopy and identifying future research areas.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Embase database using keywords (""artificial intelligence"" OR ""machine learning"" OR ""computer-aided"" OR ""convolutional neural network"") AND (""inflammatory bowel disease"" OR ""ulcerative colitis"" OR ""Crohn's"") AND (""endoscopy"" or ""colonoscopy"" or ""capsule endoscopy"" or ""device assisted enteroscopy"") between 1975 and September 2023 and identified 62 original articles for detailed review. Review articles, consensus guidelines, case reports/series, editorials, letter to the editor, non-peer-reviewed pre-prints and conference abstracts were excluded. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the MI-CLAIM checklist.
RESULTS: The accuracy of AI models (25 studies) to assess ulcerative colitis (UC) endoscopic activity ranged between 86.54% and 94.5%. AI-assisted capsule endoscopy reading (12 studies) substantially reduced analyzable images and reading time with excellent accuracy (90.5% to 99.9%). AI-assisted analysis of colonoscopic images can help differentiate IBD from non-IBD, UC from non-UC and UC from Crohn's disease (CD) (three studies) with 72.1%, 98.3% and > 90% accuracy, respectively. AI models based on non-invasive clinical and radiologic parameters could predict endoscopic activity (three studies). AI-assisted virtual chromoendoscopy (four studies) could predict histologic remission and long-term outcomes. Computer-assisted detection (CADe) of dysplasia (two studies) is feasible along with AI-based differentiation of high from low-grade IBD neoplasia (79% accuracy). AI is effective in linking electronic medical record data (two studies) with colonoscopic videos to facilitate widespread machine learning.

IBD is accompanied by massive infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the intestinal mucosa. Leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and T-cells are recruited to the affected site, exacerbating inflammation and causing tissue damage. Current treatments used to block inflammation in IBD include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics. The first successful biologic, which revolutionized IBD treatment, targeted the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Infliximab, adalimumab, and other anti-TNF antibodies neutralize TNFα, preventing interactions with its receptors and reducing the inflammatory response. However, up to 40% of people with IBD become unresponsive to anti-TNFα therapy. Thus, more recent biologics have been designed to block leukocyte trafficking to the inflamed intestine by targeting integrins and adhesins. For example, natalizumab targets the α4 chain of integrin heterodimers, α4β1 and α4β7, on leukocytes. However, binding of α4β1 is associated with increased risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, an often-fatal disease, and thus, it is not used to treat IBD. To target leukocyte infiltration without this life-threatening complication, vedolizumab was developed. Vedolizumab specifically targets the α4β7 integrin and was approved to treat IBD based on the presumption that it would block T-cell recruitment to the intestine. Though vedolizumab is an effective treatment for IBD, some studies suggest that it may not block T-cell recruitment to the intestine and its mechanism(s) of action remain unclear. Vedolizumab may reduce inflammation by blocking recruitment of T-cells, or pro-inflammatory monocytes and dendritic cells to the intestine, and/or vedolizumab may lead to changes in the programming of innate and acquired immune cells dampening down inflammation.",Luzentales-Simpson M; Pang YCF; Zhang A; Sousa JA; Sly LM,2021,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,9,,612830,10.3389/fcell.2021.612830,"Luzentales-Simpson, M., Pang, Y.

The current study was done to quantitatively summarize earlier information from prospective cohort studies on the link between dietary carbohydrates, sugar, and SSBs intake with risk of IBD. Methods: Relevant studies published up to June 2021 were searched through PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar with the use of relevant keywords. All prospective cohort studies investigating the association of dietary carbohydrates, sugar, and SSBs consumption with risk of IBD were included. Results: Combining 5 effect sizes from 4 cohort studies, no significant association was found between dietary intake of carbohydrates and risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.70-2.14). The same findings were obtained for risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.64-1.75) based on 4 studies with 5 effect sizes. A significant positive association was observed between sugar intake and risk of UC (RR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.15-2.20), as well as CD (RR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.06-3.41) when 5 effect sizes from 4 cohort studies were combined. The overall effect size, based on 4 estimates, revealed no significant association between SSBs consumption and risk of UC (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.92-1.12) and CD (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91-1.64). Conclusions: Summarizing earlier studies, sugar intake was found to be associated with increased risk of IBD and its subtypes.

40356994,Efficacy and safety of IL-23 p19 inhibitors in the treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been significantly improved by the advent of new biologics, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), particularly for refractory cases. However, the growing number of therapeutic options has also complicated clinical decision-making regarding drug selection and switching. The overall performance of IL-23 p19 inhibitors for the treatment of IBD was evaluated by the systematic review and meta-analysis in this study.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to combine the multiple indicators to accurately evaluate the efficacy and safety of IL-23 p19 inhibitors, aimed to offer an insight into the development of clinical physicians' medication.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library until June 2024 was conducted in this study, which mainly focused on the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the IL-23 p19 inhibitors within adult patients with UC or CD. Additionally, the clinical outcomes, endoscopic findings, histological assessments, and safety profiles were aggregated and subjected to analysis by a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs [15 CD, 10 UC] were involved in this study, and it was revealed that IL-23 p19 inhibitors showed significant effects on clinical remission (CR) in IBD, regardless of induction or maintenance treatment (CD, induction: risk ratio [RR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-2.23; I2 = 0%, p = 0.68; UC, induction: RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.80-4.03; I2 = 50%, p = 0.09; CD, maintenance: RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; I2 = 0%, p = 0.57; UC, maintenance: RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.92-7.49; I2 = 42%, p = 0.19), and the risk of adverse events (AEs) was similar to that of placebo (CD, induction: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.94; I2 = 2%, p = 0.41; UC, induction: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.03; I2 = 0%, p = 0.54; CD, maintenance: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13; I2 = 29%, p = 0.25; UC, maintenance: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06; I2 = 0%, p = 0.44).
CONCLUSION: In IBD treatment, IL-23 p19 inhibitor therapy exhibited effective functions in the inducement and maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remissions, as well as in some histological cases.

Although tofacitinib has proven efficacious in patients with active UC, it failed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This finding strongly hints at a different contribution of JAK signaling in both entities. Here, we review the current knowledge on the interplay between the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In particular, we provide a detailed overview of the differences and similarities of JAK/STAT-signaling in UC and CD, highlight the impact of the JAK/STAT pathway in experimental colitis models and summarize the published evidence on JAK/STAT-signaling in immune cells of IBD as well as the genetic association between the JAK/STAT pathway and IBD.

36702073,Thiopurine therapy in inflammatory bowel disease in the pandemic era: Safe or unsafe?,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major types affecting millions across the globe. Various immunomodulatory drugs consisting of small molecules (thiopurines, methotrexate and tofacitinib) and biologics are used to treat IBD. Thiopurines (TP) are widely used in the treatment of IBD and it plays an important role both alone and in combination with anti-TNF agents as IBD maintenance therapy. Although the advent of biologics therapy has significantly advanced the management of IBD, TP remains the mainstay of treatment in resource-limited and low economic settings. However, the recently commenced pandemic has raised uncertainty over the safety of the use of immunosuppressant drugs such as TP among healthcare care providers and patients, as there is a scarcity of data on whether IBD patients are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection or more prone to its severe outcomes.
AIM: This review aims to encapsulate evidence on the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severe prognosis in IBD patients on TP. Additionally, it also evaluates the role of TP in inhibiting the viral protease, a potential drug target, essential for the replication and pathogenesis of the virus.
CONCLUSION: Emerging evidence suggests that TP therapy is safe during the current pandemic and does not carry an elevated risk when used as monotherapy or in combination with other IBD drugs. In-vitro studies demonstrate that TP is a potential therapeutic for present and future betacoronavirus pandemics.",Perdalkar S; Basthi Mohan P; Musunuri B; Rajpurohit S; Shetty S; Bhat K; Pai CG,2023,International immunopharmacology,116,,109597,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109597,"Perdalkar, S., Basthi Mohan, P., Musunuri, B., Rajpurohit, S., Shetty, S., Bhat, K., & Pai, C.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are ongoing or planned to develop more effective and tolerable therapies. In parallel, a dramatic decline in recruitment rates has been observed. A multitude of factors have contributed to poor recruitment rates, including a long washout period between the investigational drug and prior advanced therapies (ie, biologic or small molecule drug).2,3 This study aims to review the different washout periods with prior advanced therapies or immunosuppressants in phase 3 RCTs for UC and CD and to propose potential solutions to ultimately improve the design of clinical studies and patient enrollment in future trials.",Wils P; Jairath V; Sands BE; Reinisch W; Danese S; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2024,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,22,4,896-898.e13,10.1016/j.cgh.2023.09.011,"Wils, P., Jairath, V., Sands, B.

34604973,Multifaceted pathogenesis of liver steatosis in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), as a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MET)-related obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, is the main cause of chronic liver disease. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), (Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC)), are often associated with extraintestinal manifestations. Of these, NAFLD is one of the most frequently reported. To highlight the etiopathogenesis of NAFLD in IBD, we performed a systematic review emphasizing the relationship between NAFLD genetic alterations, metabolic syndrome, and drugs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA) criteria, we performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for literature updated from 2010 to 1 March 2021. Inclusion criteria for studies were observational design and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs); written in English; primary research only; based on adult patients, and human research only.
RESULTS: We identified nine studies on the link between NAFLD and IBD. Among these, two described the genetic predisposition to NAFLD of patients with IBD. Four reported an association between MetS and NAFLD in IBD patients. Regarding medications, none of four studies included, detected a relationship between NAFLD onset and IBD treatment (corticosteroids, immunomodulators, methotrexate, or biologics). However, a retrospective study showed a protective effect of anti-TNF alpha therapies against altered liver enzymes.
CONCLUSIONS: In this interplay between genetic, metabolic, drug, and inflammatory factors, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms behind NAFLD in IBD are still far from clear. Further studies are needed to better clarify the role of individual components influencing the development of NAFLD in IBD.",Spagnuolo R; Abenavoli L; Corea A; Larussa T; Mancina RM; Cosco C; Luzza F; Doldo P,2021,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,25,18,5818-5825,10.26355/eurrev_202109_26800,"Spagnuolo, R., Abenavoli, L., Corea, A., Larussa, T., Mancina, R.

40041882,Bidirectional association between oral diseases caused by plaque and the inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The bidirectional association between oral diseases caused by plaque and the inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to August 2024 to identify relevant studies. The relative risk (RR) from periodontal disease studies and the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index from caries-related studies was pooled, and calculating 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and cumulative meta-analysis were employed to evaluate the robustness of the findings. The research adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, incorporating 26 studies for systematic review and 20 for meta-analysis. The results indicated no significant increase in the overall risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with periodontal disease (RR 1.31, 95 % CI 0.98-1.35); however, the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) was higher compared to controls (RR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.04-1.73). Among IBD patients, the risk of periodontal disease was significantly elevated (RR 2.14, 95 % CI 1.62-2.81), as was the risk of dental caries (WMD = 2.51, 95 % CI 0.97-4.06). Additionally, UC patients exhibited a higher incidence of caries compared to Crohn's disease (CD) patients (WMD = 3.97, 95 % CI 1.94-6.00). Sensitivity analyses and cumulative meta-analyses confirmed the stability of the results. In conclusion, IBD patients, particularly those with UC, should prioritize stringent oral hygiene to mitigate the risks of periodontal disease and dental caries.

38995110,The role of fecal biomarkers in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), is a relapsing and remitting condition. Noninvasive biomarkers have an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of IBD and in the prediction of future disease course in individuals with IBD. Strategies for the management of IBD increasingly rely upon close monitoring of gastrointestinal inflammation.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides an update on the current understanding of established and novel stool-based biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of IBD. It also highlights key gaps, identifies limitations, and advantages of current markers, and examines aspects that require further study and analysis.
EXPERT OPINION: Current noninvasive inflammatory markers play an important role in the diagnosis and management of IBD; however, limitations exist. Future work is required to further characterize and validate current and novel markers of inflammation. In addition, it is essential to better understand the roles and characteristics of noninvasive markers to enable the appropriate selection to accurately determine the condition of the intestinal mucosa.",Edwards TS; Day AS,2024,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,24,6,497-508,10.1080/14737159.2024.2375224,"Edwards, T.

34310370,Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Involvement in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Histologic Clues and Pitfalls.,"The upper gastrointestinal (UGI) manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are frequently obscured by classic ileal and colonic symptoms and are reported to involve only 0.5% to 4% of adult patients. However, because of the improvement of endoscopic techniques and the growing use of esophagogastroduodenososcopy with biopsy, both asymptomatic and clinically significant esophageal, gastric, and duodenal manifestations are increasingly recognized. The UGI involvement in IBD was historically synonymous with Crohn's disease (CD), but the doctrine of ulcerative colitis (UC) being limited to the colon has been challenged, and UC-related gastroduodenal lesions have been reported. The diagnosis of UGI IBD should ideally rely on a combination of the clinical history, endoscopic picture, and histologic features. Although endoscopic changes such as aphthoid or longitudinal ulcers and bamboo-joint-like pattern are suggestive of CD, histologic evaluation increases the sensitivity of the IBD diagnosis since histologic alterations may be present in endoscopically unremarkable mucosa. Conversely, in many cases, the histologic findings are nonspecific, and the knowledge of clinical history is vital for reaching an accurate diagnosis. The presence of epithelioid granuloma is highly suggestive of CD but is present in a minority of CD cases; thus, pathologists should be aware of how to diagnose UGI IBD in the absence of granulomata.

34513862,Rules of Engagement: Epithelial-Microbe Interactions and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are complex, multifactorial disorders that lead to chronic and relapsing intestinal inflammation. The exact etiology remains unknown, however multiple factors including the environment, genetic, dietary, mucosal immunity, and altered microbiome structure and function play important roles in disease onset and progression. Supporting this notion that the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis, studies in gnotobiotic mice have shown that mouse models of intestinal inflammation require a microbial community to develop colitis. Additionally, antimicrobial therapy in some IBD patients will temporarily induce remission further demonstrating an association between gut microbes and intestinal inflammation. Finally, a dysfunctional intestinal epithelial barrier is also recognized as a key pathogenic factor in IBD. The intestinal epithelium serves as a barrier between the luminal environment and the mucosal immune system and guards against harmful molecules and microorganisms while being permeable to essential nutrients and solutes. Beneficial (i.e., mutualists) bacteria promote mucosal health by strengthening barrier integrity, increasing local defenses (mucin and IgA production) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory immune responses and apoptosis to promote mucosal homeostasis. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria and pathobionts suppress expression and localization of tight junction proteins, cause dysregulation of apoptosis/proliferation and increase pro-inflammatory signaling that directly damages the intestinal mucosa. This review article will focus on the role of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the luminal environment acting as mediators of barrier function in IBD. We will also share some of our translational observations of interactions between IECs, immune cells, and environmental factors contributing to maintenance of mucosal homeostasis, as it relates to GI inflammation and IBD in different animal models.",Jergens AE; Parvinroo S; Kopper J; Wannemuehler MJ,2021,Frontiers in medicine,8,,669913,10.3389/fmed.2021.669913,"Jergens, A.

38001985,The Prokineticin System in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Clinical and Preclinical Overview.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. IBDs clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and characterized by a chronic relapsing-remitting course. Typical gastrointestinal signs and symptoms include diarrhea, GI bleeding, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Moreover, the presence of pain often manifests in the remitting disease phase. As a result, patients report a further reduction in life quality. Despite the scientific advances implemented in the last two decades and the therapies aimed at inducing or maintaining IBDs in a remissive condition, to date, their pathophysiology still remains unknown. In this scenario, the importance of identifying a common and effective therapeutic target for both digestive symptoms and pain remains a priority. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have reported the prokineticin system (PKS) as an emerging therapeutic target for IBDs. PKS alterations are likely to play a role in IBDs at multiple levels, such as in intestinal motility, local inflammation, ulceration processes, localized abdominal and visceral pain, as well as central nervous system sensitization, leading to the development of chronic and widespread pain. This narrative review summarized the evidence about the involvement of the PKS in IBD and discussed its potential as a druggable target.",Amodeo G; Franchi S; Galimberti G; Riboldi B; Sacerdote P,2023,Biomedicines,11,11,,10.3390/biomedicines11112985,"Amodeo, G., Franchi, S., Galimberti, G., Riboldi, B., & Sacerdote, P.

Although the precise etiology is unknown, developments in high-throughput microbial genomic sequencing significantly illuminate the changes in the intestinal microbial structure and functions in patients with IBD. The application of microbial metabolomics suggests that the microbiota can influence IBD pathogenesis by producing metabolites, which are implicated as crucial mediators of host-microbial crosstalk. This review aims to elaborate the current knowledge of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD with description of altered composition and metabolite profiles of gut microbiota. We emphasized and elaborated recent findings of several potentially protective metabolite classes in IBD, including fatty acids, amino acids and derivatives and bile acids. This article will facilitate a deeper understanding of the new therapeutic approach for IBD by applying metabolome-based adjunctive treatment.",Li M; Yang L; Mu C; Sun Y; Gu Y; Chen D; Liu T; Cao H,2022,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,20,,2402-2414,10.1016/j.csbj.2022.03.038,"Li, M., Yang, L., Mu, C., Sun, Y., Gu, Y., Chen, D., Liu, T., & Cao, H.

33733538,"The association between ectopic pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease: A systematic review.","AIM: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease (CeD) more commonly affect women of reproductive age. The aim of our study is to evaluate the association between ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women with IBD, IBS, and CeD.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL from the database inception date through December 31, 2020. Peer-reviewed publications and abstracts written in English, regarding the association between EP and IBD, IBS, and CeD with controls were included. Quality assessment was conducted based on GRADE criteria. Analyses included odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity between studies was presented with I2 .
RESULTS: We included five population-based cohort studies. The odds of EP significantly increased in Crohn's disease (CD), but not ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared to IBD-free controls. The odds of EP significantly increased in IBS as compared to women without IBS. No significant difference was observed for odds of EP in women with and without CeD.

39583912,18F-FDG-PET and other imaging modalities in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which encompasses ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that presents complex diagnostic and management challenges. Early detection and treatment of IBD is paramount, as IBD can present with serious complications, including bowel perforation, arthritis, and colorectal cancer. Most forms of diagnosis and therapeutic management, like ileocolonoscopy and upper endoscopy are highly invasive and require extensive preparation at great discomfort to patients. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) imaging can be a potential solution to the current limitations in imaging for IBD. This review explores the utility and limitations of various imaging modalities used to detect and manage IBD including ileocolonoscopy, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), gastrointestinal ultrasound (IUS), and 18F-FDG-PET/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (18F-FDG-PET/MR).

39906350,Prevalence and predictors of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been reported to be very common among individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the prevalence of SIBO is highly variable. We conducted this study to calculate the prevalence and identify predictors of SIBO in IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE from inception to March 2024 were searched for studies evaluating the prevalence of SIBO in IBD. We calculated the pooled prevalence of SIBO among IBD patients and the odds ratio (OR) of SIBO in IBD compared with healthy controls. Besides, we also evaluated predictors of SIBO in IBD patients.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (3,250 IBD, 708 controls) were included in our study. The pooled prevalence of SIBO in IBD was 31.0% (95% CI 25.2-37.1), and the prevalence of SIBO was higher in IBD compared with healthy controls (OR 5.25, 95% CI 2.96-9.32). The pooled prevalence of SIBO was higher among CD patients (32.2, 95% CI 25.9-38.8) compared with UC patients (27.8, 95% CI 18.5-38.1). The odds of lower BMI (mean difference = -1.04; 95% CI -1.86 to -0.23), bloating (OR = 3.02, 95% CI 1.22-7.5), flatulence (OR = 4.70, 95% CI 1.44-15.35), history of abdominal surgery (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.35-3.11), and stricturing/penetrating disease behavior (OR = 3.51, 95% CI 1.67-7.40) increased significantly in IBD patients with SIBO compared to those without SIBO. Antibiotic treatment may be effective for SIBO in IBD patients.
CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of IBD patients present with SIBO positive, and the odds of SIBO in IBD was increased by 5.25-fold compared with healthy controls. Lower BMI, bloating, flatulence, history of abdominal surgery, and stricturing/penetrating disease behavior were predictors of SIBO in IBD patients.",Feng X; Hu J; Zhang X,2024,Frontiers in medicine,11,,1490506,10.3389/fmed.2024.1490506,"Feng, X., Hu, J., & Zhang, X.

33401588,Impact of Body Mass Index on the Development of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Analysis of 15.6 Million Participants.,"BACKGROUND: A growing trove of literature describes the effect of malnutrition and underweight on the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, evidence regarding the association between underweight or obesity and IBD is limited. The study aimed to assess the association of body mass index (BMI) with a risk of IBD (Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (U.C.)) incidence.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for observational studies assessing the association between BMI and IBD that were published up to 30 June 2020. We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random effect dose-response meta-analysis was performed using the variance weighted least-squares regression (VWLS) models to identify non-linear associations.
RESULTS: A total of ten studies involving 15.6 million individuals and 23,371 cases of IBD were included. Overall, obesity was associated with an increased IBD risk (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08-1.34, I 2 = 0%). Compared to normal weight, underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were associated with a higher risk of CD, and there was no difference in the risk of U.C. among those with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. There was a significant non-linear association between being underweight and obesity and the risk of development of CD (Coef1 = -0.0902, p 1 < 0.001 Coef2 = 0.0713, p 2 < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity increases the risk of IBD development. Underweight and obesity are independently associated with an increased risk of CD, yet there is no evident association between BMI and the risk of U.C.

40277893,Inflammation-Associated Carcinogenesis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Features and Molecular Mechanisms.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic condition marked by persistent intestinal inflammation of unknown etiology. Disease onset involves genetic predisposition and environmental factors that disrupt the intestinal immune homeostasis. The intestinal microbiome and immune response play pivotal roles in disease progression. Advances in molecular therapies and early interventions have reduced surgery rates; however, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant concern, driven by chronic inflammation. In UC, the risk of UC-associated neoplasia (UCAN) increases with disease duration, while CD patients face elevated risks of small intestine, anal fistula, and anal canal cancers. Endoscopic surveillance is advised for UCAN, but optimal screening intervals remain undefined, and no established guidelines exist for CD-associated cancers. UCAN morphology often complicates detection due to its flat, inflammation-blended appearance, which differs pathologically from sporadic CRC (sCRC). UCAN is frequently surrounded by dysplasia, with p53 mutations evident at the dysplasia stage. IBD-associated gastrointestinal cancers exemplify inflammation-driven carcinogenesis with distinct molecular mechanisms from the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. This review explores the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical and pathological features, current surveillance practices, and molecular pathways underlying inflammation-associated cancers in IBD.",Hisamatsu T; Miyoshi J; Oguri N; Morikubo H; Saito D; Hayashi A; Omori T; Matsuura M,2025,Cells,14,8,,10.3390/cells14080567,"Hisamatsu, T., Miyoshi, J., Oguri, N., Morikubo, H., Saito, D., Hayashi, A., Omori, T., & Matsuura, M.

37153103,Inflammatory bowel disease and risk of Parkinson's disease: evidence from a meta-analysis of 14 studies involving more than 13.4 million individuals.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has been investigated in several epidemiological studies. However, the results of these studies were inconclusive and inconsistent. We evaluated the potential relationship between IBD and PD risk by a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Search the electronic databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases from inception to November 30, 2022, to identify relevant studies that assess the risk of PD in patients with IBD. The cohort, cross-sectional, mendelian randomization and case-control studies that reported risk estimates of PD and IBD were included in our analysis. The random-effect model and fixed-effects model were used to calculate the summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: In total, 14 studies (nine cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, two mendelian randomization studies and one case-control study) involving more than 13.4 million individuals were analyzed in our analysis. Our results suggested that the risk of PD in IBD patients is moderately increased, with the pooled RR was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.03-1.33, P = 0.019). Omit of any single study from this analysis had little effect on the combined risk estimate. No evidence of publication bias was found. In the subgroup analysis, the combined RR was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.12, P = 0.311) for Crohn's disease (CD), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.31, P = 0.002) for ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, a significant association was identified in patients with IBD aged ≥ 60 years (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06-1.41, P = 0.007), but not in age < 60 years (RR = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.58-2.41, P = 0.639). Meanwhile, the meta-analysis results suggested a protective role for IBD medication use against PD development, with the RR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.04, P = 0.126).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that patients with IBD had a moderately higher risk of PD compared to non-IBD individuals. Patients with IBD should be aware of the potential risks for PD, especially who were ≥ 60 years old.",Li HX; Zhang C; Zhang K; Liu YZ; Peng XX; Zong Q,2023,Frontiers in medicine,10,,1137366,10.3389/fmed.2023.1137366,"Li, H.

39571265,Novel targets for mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease therapy.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract, primarily manifesting as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). Both inflammation and disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier are key factors in IBD pathogenesis. Substantial evidence has revealed a significant association between aberrant immune responses and impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD pathogenesis. The components of the intestinal epithelium, particularly goblet cells and Paneth cells, are crucial to gut homeostasis, as they secrete mucin, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and cytokines. Furthermore, impairment of epithelial integrity, which is regulated by tight junctions, is a hallmark of IBD pathology. While common treatments for IBD, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, target various signaling pathways with varying efficacies, therapeutic approaches focused on mucosal and epithelial barrier healing have been largely neglected. Moreover, high costs, side effects, and insufficient or inconsistent therapeutic outcomes remain major drawbacks of conventional anti-IBD drugs. Recent studies on epithelial barrier regeneration and permeability reduction have introduced promising therapeutic targets, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) interaction, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and insulin receptor (INSR). Notably, the simultaneous targeting of intestinal inflammation and promotion of epithelial barrier healing shows promise for efficient IBD treatment. Future research should explore targeted therapies and combination treatments, including natural remedies, microbiota colonization, stem cell approaches, and computer-aided drug design. It is also crucial to focus on accurate prognosis and developing a thorough understanding of IBD development mechanisms.",Mansouri P; Mansouri P; Behmard E; Najafipour S; Kouhpayeh A; Farjadfar A,2025,International immunopharmacology,144,,113544,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.113544,"Mansouri, P., Mansouri, P., Behmard, E., Najafipour, S., Kouhpayeh, A., & Farjadfar, A.

39187100,Application of chitosan as nano carrier in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is characterized by persistent and recurrent gastrointestinal inflammation. Conventional IBD therapies often involve the use of antibiotics, NSAIDs, biological agents, and immunomodulators. While these medications can mitigate acute inflammatory symptoms, their long-term efficacy is frequently compromised due to cumulative toxic effects. In recent years, significant attention has shifted toward nanoparticle (NP)-based therapies as potential alternatives for IBD management. Various drug delivery strategies, including those targeting microbiota interactions, ligand-receptor binding, pH sensitivity, biodegradability, pressure response, and specific charge and size parameters, have been explored and optimized in animal studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of chitosan NP-mediated drug delivery systems for IBD treatment. Additionally, it will discuss the prevailing challenges and propose future research directions to advance chitosan NP-based therapeutic strategies for IBD.",Liu X; Dong Y; Wang C; Guo Z,2024,International journal of biological macromolecules,278,Pt 4,134899,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134899,"Liu, X., Dong, Y., Wang, C., & Guo, Z.

40662074,Effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological therapies for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: a network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic, inflammatory, and immune-mediated disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. If left inadequately treated, IBD can lead to disease progression, resulting in severe long-term complications, including irreversible structural damage to the intestinal tissues. While clinical symptoms are traditionally used to assess treatment efficacy, they do not always align with the underlying mucosal inflammation, particularly in CD. This limitation underscores the importance of exploring alternative treatment strategies. To address this gap, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments (NPTs) for IBD through a network meta-analysis (NMA), providing a thorough assessment of the available evidence.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Springer, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science, comparing various NPTs for IBD, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), diet interventions (DI), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), physical training (PT), and acupuncture and moxibustion (APMX). Outcomes assessed included clinical remission, disease activity, quality of life (QOL), serum biomarkers (fecal calprotectin [FC] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), and adverse effects. The quality assessment was assessed by Cochrane Handbook and GRADEpro software. The risk ratio (RR) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes while standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for continuous variables with 95% credible intervals (CI). Funnel plot was performed to evaluate publication bias. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was conducted to rank the included interventions. Data were analyzed with STATA 15.0 and Review Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: A total of 62 eligible RCTs were identified in this NMA. The results showed that standard medical therapy (SMT) exhibited the highest probability in inducing clinical remission, as expected. Among non-pharmacological interventions, APMX, a traditional Chinese medicine involving acupuncture and moxibustion, showed promising results in both animal models and clinical trials, reducing serum TNF-α levels and improving intestinal health. DI was most effective in maintaining clinical remission and reducing serum FC levels. FMT emerged as the most effective treatment for reducing serum CRP levels and ranked second in terms of clinical remission induction.
CONCLUSION: APMX, DI, and FMT represent promising non-pharmacological options for managing IBD. APMX was the most effective for clinical remission and symptom relief, while DI was best for maintaining remission, and FMT showed promise in reducing inflammation. Further high-quality clinical trials are needed to strengthen the evidence and guide clinical practice in IBD management.

32823518,Divergent Effect of Cigarette Smoke on Innate Immunity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Nicotine-Infection Interaction.,"Cigarette smoke (CS) has adverse effects in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that has been associated with microbial infection, immuno-dysregulation, and mucosal dysfunction. However, CS seems to provide relief and protection to patients with another IBD known as ulcerative colitis (UC). These two subsets are featured as M1- and M2-mediated responses, respectively. Nicotine is the most active, addictive, and studied ingredient in CS. The mechanism of how nicotine and/or other CS ingredients induce pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes in IBD patients remains under investigation. Our most recent in vitro nicotine study provided significant insights toward understanding the contradictory effects of nicotine on IBD patients, and it elucidated the mechanistic role of α7nAChR in modulation of macrophages in tobacco smokers. Shifting the beneficial effect of nicotine to a harmful outcome in CD patients was linked to a nicotine-microbe interaction that supports a microbial etiology in CD pathogenesis. Among the most debated pathogens in CD etiology is Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Other studies associated nicotine with upregulation of miR-124 expression in macrophages, which led to anti-inflammatory response. This review discusses published work on the role of nicotine in modulation of the innate immune response and subsequent signaling in macrophages in IBD subsets.",AlQasrawi D; Qasem A; Naser SA,2020,International journal of molecular sciences,21,16,,10.3390/ijms21165801,"AlQasrawi, D., Qasem, A., & Naser, S.

38901239,"A comprehensive immunobiology review of IBD: With a specific glance to Th22 lymphocytes development, biology, function, and role in IBD.","The two primary forms of inflammatory disorders of the small intestine andcolon that make up inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). While ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and the rectum, CD affects the small and large intestines, as well as the esophagus,mouth, anus, andstomach. Although the etiology of IBD is not completely clear, and there are many unknowns about it, the development, progression, and recurrence of IBD are significantly influenced by the activity of immune system cells, particularly lymphocytes, given that the disease is primarily caused by the immune system stimulation and activation against gastrointestinal (GI) tract components due to the inflammation caused by environmental factors such as viral or bacterial infections, etc. in genetically predisposed individuals. Maintaining homeostasis and the integrity of the mucosal barrier are critical in stopping the development of IBD. Specific immune system cells and the quantity of secretory mucus and microbiome are vital in maintaining this stability. Th22 cells are helper T lymphocyte subtypes that are particularly important for maintaining the integrity and equilibrium of the mucosal barrier.

40826333,Evaluation of the association between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have shown a connection between periodontal diseases and conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and periodontitis.
METHODS: A systematic study was conducted in seven databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Embase, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect) from 1960 to December 30, 2024. Articles investigating the relationship between periodontitis and IBD were selected based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the selected articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa checklist. The prevalence of periodontitis in individuals with and without IBD, as well as in each subgroup (UC and CD), was reported in terms of odds ratio (OR). Data analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta Analysis (CMA) software.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in this systematic review. Statistical analysis of 10 studies revealed that, compared to the control group (without IBD), IBD patients had a significantly higher likelihood of periodontitis (OR: 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.73-3). Within each IBD subgroup, the likelihood of periodontitis was higher compared to the control group. The risk of developing periodontitis in patients diagnosed with UC and CD was found to be (OR: 3.14; 95% CI: 2.11-4.66) and (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.4-2.83), respectively. However, this discrepancy was not statistically significant (P = 0.09).

40429917,Targeting the IL-23 Receptor Gene: A Promising Approach in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. A key component of the inflammatory pathway in IBD is interleukin 23 (IL-23), which promotes the differentiation and maintenance of Th17 cells. These cells are major contributors to intestinal inflammation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A dysregulated IL-23/Th17 axis can lead to excessive gut inflammation. Notably, IL-23 affects Th17 cell responses differently in UC and CD, fostering IL-17 production in UC and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production in CD. Genetic studies have pinpointed specific variants of the IL-23 receptor (IL23R) gene that confer protection against IBD. The R381Q (rs11209026) variant has been linked to a reduced risk of developing both CD and UC. Additionally, other variants, such as G149R (rs76418789) and V362I (rs41313262), inhibit IL23R function by disrupting intracellular trafficking and protein stability. This disruption results in decreased phosphorylation of downstream signal transducers, such as STAT3 and STAT4, and reduced IL23R expression on the cell surface, ultimately dampening the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. The protective effects of these genetic variants underscore the IL-23/IL23R pathway as a significant therapeutic target in IBD management. Therapies designed to modulate this pathway have the potential to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Ongoing research into the IL23R gene and its variants continues to provide valuable insights, paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments for IBD patients.",Pastras P; Aggeletopoulou I; Papantoniou K; Triantos C,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,10,,10.3390/ijms26104775,"Pastras, P., Aggeletopoulou, I., Papantoniou, K., & Triantos, C.

31634529,Multiple outcome meta-analysis of gene-expression data in inflammatory bowel disease.,"We performed a multivariate meta-analysis of microarray data in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC), which are the main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They share similar symptoms but differ in the location and extent of inflammation and in complications. We identified 249 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD and 38 in UC at a false discovery rate of 1%. 20 of the DEGs were common to both diseases. A multivariate test identified 260 DEGs associated with IBD, 53 of which were not found in any of the disorders. We identified important molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, such as the JAK/STAT and interferon-gamma signaling pathways, genes involved in cell adhesion, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Among others, BCAT1 and GZMB are interesting novel DEGs that deserve further investigation in experimental models.

36032720,Opportunities and challenges for synthetic biology in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder that primarily includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although traditional antibiotics and immunosuppressants are known as the most effective and commonly used treatments, some limitations may be expected, such as limited efficacy in a small number of patients and gut flora disruption. A great many research studies have been done with respect to the etiology of IBD, while the composition of the gut microbiota is suggested as one of the most influential factors. Along with the development of synthetic biology and the continuing clarification of IBD etiology, broader prospects for novel approaches to IBD therapy could be obtained. This study presents an overview of the currently existing treatment options and possible therapeutic targets at the preclinical stage with respect to microbial synthesis technology in biological therapy. This study is highly correlated to the following topics: microbiota-derived metabolites, microRNAs, cell therapy, calreticulin, live biotherapeutic products (LBP), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), bacteriophages, engineered bacteria, and their functional secreted synthetic products for IBD medical implementation. Considering microorganisms as the main therapeutic component, as a result, the related clinical trial stability, effectiveness, and safety analysis may be the major challenges for upcoming research.

40565217,Molecular Basis of Chronic Intestinal Wall Fibrosis in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD-unclassified (IBD-U), are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation in the course of IBD is an important initiating factor of fibrosis of the intestinal wall. Intestinal fibrosis is one of the most common and important complications of IBD and, due to the irreversibility of the process and the need for surgical treatment, currently poses a major clinical challenge. In this review, we presented in detail the process of intestinal wall fibrosis at the molecular, immunological, and clinical levels. We characterized the mediators, including transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and others participating in this process. We also described the type 2 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process closely associated with chronic inflammation, leading to excessive development of connective tissue in the intestinal wall in the course of IBD.",Sputa-Grzegrzolka P; Socha-Banasiak A; Dziegiel P; Kempisty B,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,12,,10.3390/ijms26125754,"Sputa-Grzegrzolka, P., Socha-Banasiak, A., Dziegiel, P., & Kempisty, B.

38848323,Inflammatory bowel disease and risk of autoimmune hepatitis: A univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).
METHODS: Two-sample MR was performed to estimate the causal effect of IBD on AIH. The primary analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method in univariable MR analysis, supplemented by additional methods including MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. The p values were adjusted by FDR p-value adjustment. In the replication analysis, the primary IVW analysis was repeated and then pooled by meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out, and funnel plot analysis to evaluate the robustness of the MR findings. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) was employed to estimate the direct causal effect of IBD on the risk of AIH.
RESULTS: In univariable MR analysis, a significant positive causal association was observed between IBD (both Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC)) and the risk of AIH (for CD and AIH, the IVW odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-1.16, P = 0.045, FDR P = 0.045; for UC and AIH, the IVW OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00-1.13, P = 0.038, FDR P = 0.076). Furthermore, no significant positive correlation between IBD and the risk of AIH (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.94-1.35, P = 0.194). Sensitivity analysis revealed no pleiotropic bias. MVMR analysis further confirmed the direct causal effect of CD or UC on the risk of AIH after adjusting for the common risk factors (cigarettes per day and osteoporosis). In the replication analysis, the positive causal association between UC and the risk of AIH remain significant (the IVW odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.18-1.48, P = 2.90E-06). While no significant positive association was observed between CD or IBD and the risk of AIH in the replication analysis, a suggestive positive association between the identified risk factors (UC, CD, and IBD) and the risk of AIH was detected in the meta-analysis (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05-1.13, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This MR study revealed a positive impact of the identified risk factors (CD, UC and IBD) on the risk of AIH within the European population.",Chi G; Pei J; Li X,2024,PloS one,19,6,e0305220,10.1371/journal.pone.0305220,"Chi, G., Pei, J., & Li, X.

31901795,Metabolomic profiling in children with inflammatory bowel disease.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) represent inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with multifactorial pathogenesis, involving genetic, environmental and microbial factors. Interactions between gut microbiota and immune system result in changes in metabolic pathways. Metabolomics is a comprehensive and quantitative (or semi-quantitative) analysis of metabolites synthetized in human's biological system. It has been shown that metabolic profiling might be used to identify disease biomarkers. Recent findings confirmed alterations in the number of metabolites in patients with IBD. However, most of the studies included adult individuals with ongoing treatment which might have affected the metabolite profiling. Therefore, the aim of our study was to collect the knowledge about metabolomics in paediatric patients with CD or UC based on the currently published literature.",Filimoniuk A; Daniluk U; Samczuk P; Wasilewska N; Jakimiec P; Kucharska M; Lebensztejn DM; Ciborowski M,2020,Advances in medical sciences,65,1,65-70,10.1016/j.advms.2019.12.009,"Filimoniuk, A., Daniluk, U., Samczuk, P., Wasilewska, N., Jakimiec, P., Kucharska, M., Lebensztejn, D.

37259751,The potential therapeutic role of vitamin D in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is defined as a relapsing and remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation at different sites in the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) represents the two major forms of IBD. Even though IBD pathophysiology is still not fully understood, genetic factors, environmental factors, dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, alterations in gut microbiota composition, excessive consumption of saturated fats and cumulative antibiotic exposure have all been suggested to play a role in the development of this condition. Amongst the environmental factors, vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to participate in IBD pathophysiology. Indeed, vitamin D exerts several pleiotropic effects beyond its well-established regulation of bone and calcium homeostasis, including anti-infective, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects as well as maintenance of gastrointestinal barrier integrity and beneficial gut microbiota composition. In this narrative review, we discuss the role of vitamin D deficiency in IBD pathophysiology as well as the potential therapeutic use of vitamin D for the management of IBD.",Boccuzzi L; Infante M; Ricordi C,2023,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,27,10,4678-4687,10.26355/eurrev_202305_32479,"Boccuzzi, L., Infante, M., & Ricordi, C.

32850517,Opening a Window on Attention: Adjuvant Therapies for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly known as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative disease (UC), is a chronic and relapsing intestinal disease which cannot be cured completely. The prevalence of IBD in Europe and in North America has increased over the past 20 years. As most IBD patients are young at onset, their quality of life (QOL) can be influenced to varying degrees. Thus, current treatment goals are typically focused on preventing complications, including maintaining clinical remission and improving the QOL. Adjuvant therapies have been widely concerned as an effective treatment in alleviating IBD symptoms, including dietary intervention, traditional Chinese medicine, smoking, alcohol, and physical activities. This review focuses on different ancillary therapies for IBD treatments, in particular the mechanism of reducing inflammation based on the actual data from research studies. Moreover, comparing the latest data, this review also presented potential future prospect for adjuvant therapies.",Wang Q; Mi S; Yu Z; Li Q; Lei J,2020,Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2020,,7397523,10.1155/2020/7397523,"Wang, Q., Mi, S., Yu, Z., Li, Q., & Lei, J.

33960728,Increased risk of stroke among patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and stroke showed conflicting results.
METHODS: Articles published before July 2020 were searched in databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar). We computed all multivariate odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by using STATA 12.0 software.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated that IBD was associated with an elevated risk of stroke (OR/RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34, I2 = 83.6%, p < .001). In addition, both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were associated with a higher risk of stroke (CD: OR/RR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.52, I2 = 86.1%, p < .001; UC: OR/RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15, I2 = 54.7%, p = .051). Subgroup study showed that IBD was associated with a higher risk of stroke in cohort studies (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36, I2 = 85.0%, p < .001). Subgroup study showed that IBD was related to an elevated risk of stroke in both Caucasian and Asian groups (Caucasian group: OR/RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.23, I2 = 44.6%, p = .094; Asian group: OR/RR =1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, I2 = 92.5%, p < .001).

38789987,Epidemiologic profile of inflammatory bowel disease in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main types: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The epidemiology of IBD patients has not been comprehensively studied in EMRO countries; therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to study the epidemiology of this disease in these countries.
METHODS: We searched four international databases, namely Scopus, Web of Knowledge (ISI), Medline/PubMed, and ProQuest, from inception up to the end of May 2023. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline was used to carry out this systematic review and meta-analysis investigation. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist, the quality of the selected papers was assessed.
RESULTS: Based on the results of this study, the incidence of UC in EMRO countries was 2.65 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.39-3.90), and the incidence of CD was 1.16 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.73-1.59). The most commonly involved intestinal segment in CD was the terminal ileum (44.7%, 95% CI: 34.7-55.2), followed by the ileum (29.8%, 95% CI: 22.2-38.6), and colon (18.7%, 95% CI: 10.8-30.4). However, in UC patients, extensive colitis was the most common finding (32.3%, 95% CI: 26.4-38.8), followed by proctosigmoiditis (27.9%, 95% CI: 21.1-35.8), left-sided colitis (27.4%, 95% CI: 22.7-32.7), and proctitis (22.6%, 95% CI: 17.5-28.5).
CONCLUSION: As a result, we were able to establish the traits of IBD patients in EMRO nations. UC patients had a higher incidence than CD patients. The most common regions of involvement in CD and UC patients, respectively, were the colon and pancolitis. Compared to UC patients, CD patients had a higher history of appendectomy.",Sanat ZM; Vahedi H; Malekzadeh R; Fanni Z,2024,BMC public health,24,1,1395,10.1186/s12889-024-18816-z,"Sanat, Z.

37834967,Cyclic Neutropenia Mimicking Crohn's Disease: Two Case Reports and a Narrative Review.,"Cyclic neutropenia is a rare hematological condition characterized by periodic fluctuations in neutrophil counts, with a 21-day periodicity. Clinical presentation varies from mild to severe forms of the disease, with the onset of recurrent fever, painful oral ulcers, recurrent bacterial infections, peritonitis, and septic shock. The availability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the management and natural history of this disease, regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of the progenitor cells, and reducing the duration of neutropenia. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a group of chronic pathologies that affect the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of both diseases may be at a young age (even during childhood or adolescence), and clinical manifestations may lead to misdiagnosis, due to similar characteristics such as recurrent infections, oral ulcers, perianal abscesses, and infertility. Moreover, the two pathologies are rarely associated, with different management and therapeutic options. Here, we describe two case reports of patients who underwent surgery because of diagnosis of complicated CD. After surgery, due to persistent neutropenia, the hematologist consultant confirmed suspicions of cyclic neutropenia, and G-CSF therapy was started with benefits, underlining the crucial importance of proper differential diagnosis.",Guarino AD; Luglio G; Imperatore N; Cerciello G; Pugliese N; Castiglione F; Tropeano FP; Testa A; Olmo O; Rispo A,2023,Journal of clinical medicine,12,19,,10.3390/jcm12196323,"Guarino, A.

32768980,The crucial role of non-coding RNAs in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract which pose significant social and economic burden on health system. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two main classes of IBD which seem to share genetic susceptibly factors at least to some extent. Abnormal immune responses and dysregulation of pre-inflammatory cytokines have been observed in patients with IBD. More recently, several studies have indicated abnormal function and expression levels of a number of non-coding RNAs including both microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Not surprisingly, dysregulated miRNAs and lncRNAs were mostly enriched in pathways that regulate immune responses such as NF-κB pathway and those influence activity and differentiation of Th17 cells. In the current review, we aim at exploration of the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of IBD. We first summarize the results of studies which reported aberrant expression of these transcripts in colonic tissues or plasma samples of patients with IBD. Then, we discuss the potential of these transcripts as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets in this regard.",Ghafouri-Fard S; Eghtedarian R; Taheri M,2020,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,129,,110507,10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110507,"Ghafouri-Fard, S., Eghtedarian, R., & Taheri, M.

33352566,"The Effect of Sodium Butyrate Enemas Compared with Placebo on Disease Activity, Endoscopic Scores, and Histological and Inflammatory Parameters in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review of Randomised Controlled Trials.","INTRODUCTION: Administration of butyrate enemas might improve the health status of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the results seem equivocal. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to assess the effect of sodium butyrate enemas on disease activity index (DAI), endoscopic scores, as well as histological and inflammatory parameters in IBD patients.
METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched. Randomised controlled trials published in English that assessed the effect of butyrate enemas on DAI, clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers, as well as histological and endoscopic scores in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: Eight studies involving 227 UC patients were included in this analysis. Only one study reported significant differences in DAI between groups. Besides, butyrate treatment groups did not differ significantly from controls concerning the effect on endoscopic and histological scores. Moreover, butyrate enemas exerted a significant effect on few inflammatory parameters measured in colonic mucosal biopsies.
CONCLUSION: The current evidence is limited and does not support the application of butyrate enemas in UC. There are no reliable data regarding the efficacy of butyrate enemas in CD. The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020163654).",Jamka M; Kokot M; Kaczmarek N; Bermagambetova S; Nowak JK; Walkowiak J,2021,Complementary medicine research,28,4,344-356,10.1159/000512952,"Jamka, M., Kokot, M., Kaczmarek, N., Bermagambetova, S., Nowak, J.

38199049,Comparative characteristics of fatigue in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is a common symptom in both irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to distinguish fatigue characteristics in IBS and IBD, two functional and organic disorders.
METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases from inception to June 30, 2023, and conducted a meta-analysis to generate precise estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The analyses were stratified by fatigue type, severity, sex, disease phase, and comorbidities, and study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
RESULTS: Our analysis included 74 data (13 IBS, 31 CD, 30 UC) encompassing 16,689 participants (6484 males, 7402 females, and 2803 unknown). Overall, fatigue prevalence trended higher in IBS (54.5% [95%CI, 44.5-64.6]), followed by CD (49.8% [95%CI, 44.0-55.5]) and UC (43.6% [95%CI, 38.5-48.7]). This pattern persisted across sub-analyses, including general fatigue (63.4% vs. 51.3% vs. 45.3%) and moderate to severe fatigue (73.8% vs. 59.5% vs. 52.7%) for IBS, CD, and UC, respectively. Female predominance was observed in all three diseases (odds ratio: 1.5 in IBS and CD, 1.8 in UC). Fatigue prevalence significantly varied between disease phases (active vs. remission) in CD (61.3% vs. 36.3%) and UC (53.8% vs. 32.6%). Anemia, anxiety/depression, and/or IBS-like symptoms also contributed to fatigue in CD and UC.

In the analysis of two case-control studies providing data on BC in UC and CD combined, IBD patients seemed to have a higher risk of BC than non-IBD patients (relative risk: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.77-2.03; I 2 = 37.5%). Although the overall risk of BC was not significantly increased among patients with IBD, there was a weak trend for the risk to be elevated in CD patients, indicating marginal significance. These findings may primarily be explained by the opposite effects of smoking on CD and UC as well as the immunosuppressive drugs these patients often take.",Geng Z; Geng Q,2021,Frontiers in surgery,8,,636791,10.3389/fsurg.2021.636791,"Geng, Z., & Geng, Q.

38004578,Delivery Strategies of Probiotics from Nano- and Microparticles: Trends in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-An Overview.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder, most known as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), that affects the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), causing considerable symptoms to millions of people around the world. Conventional therapeutic strategies have limitations and side effects, prompting the exploration of innovative approaches. Probiotics, known for their potential to restore gut homeostasis, have emerged as promising candidates for IBD management. Probiotics have been shown to minimize disease symptoms, particularly in patients affected by UC, opening important opportunities to better treat this disease. However, they exhibit limitations in terms of stability and targeted delivery. As several studies demonstrate, the encapsulation of the probiotics, as well as the synthetic drug, into micro- and nanoparticles of organic materials offers great potential to solve this problem. They resist the harsh conditions of the upper GIT portions and, thus, protect the probiotic and drug inside, allowing for the delivery of adequate amounts directly into the colon. An overview of UC and CD, the benefits of the use of probiotics, and the potential of micro- and nanoencapsulation technologies to improve IBD treatment are presented. This review sheds light on the remarkable potential of nano- and microparticles loaded with probiotics as a novel and efficient strategy for managing IBD. Nonetheless, further investigations and clinical trials are warranted to validate their long-term safety and efficacy, paving the way for a new era in IBD therapeutics.",Lopes SA; Roque-Borda CA; Duarte JL; Di Filippo LD; Borges Cardoso VM; Pavan FR; Chorilli M; Meneguin AB,2023,Pharmaceutics,15,11,,10.3390/pharmaceutics15112600,"Lopes, S.

39064796,Saffron as a Promising Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory illness of the gastrointestinal tract (GI), characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and tissue destruction. It affects an increasing number of individuals worldwide who suffer from Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite substantial advances in understanding the underlying causes of IBD, the available treatments remain restricted and are sometimes accompanied by severe consequences. Consequently, there is an urgent need to study alternate therapeutic options. This review assesses the present drugs, identifies their limitations, and proposes the use of saffron, a natural plant with great therapeutic potential based on preclinical and clinical investigations. Saffron has gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in treating various ailments due to its established bioactive compounds possessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This review covers how saffron impacts the levels of calprotectin, an inflammatory marker, for various inflammatory responses in multiple diseases including IBD. Data from clinical trials were assessed to determine the efficacy and safety of using saffron to counter inflammation in multiple diseases. Studies have shown that saffron may protect against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through several mechanisms by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), reducing oxidative stress through antioxidant effects, enhancing mucosal barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins, and modulating the gut microbiota composition to promote beneficial bacteria while suppressing pathogenic ones; these combined actions contribute to its therapeutic potential in managing and alleviating the symptoms of IBD. This will enable future research endeavors and expedite the translation of saffron-based interventions into clinical practice as a valuable adjunctive therapy or a potential alternative to conventional treatments, thereby enhancing the quality of life for individuals suffering from inflammatory diseases including IBD.",Rashid M; Rashid R; Saroya S; Deverapalli M; Brim H; Ashktorab H,2024,Nutrients,16,14,,10.3390/nu16142353,"Rashid, M., Rashid, R., Saroya, S., Deverapalli, M., Brim, H., & Ashktorab, H.

40723889,Quantitative Alterations in Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) impair the gut barrier and immune function, promoting inflammation and highlighting microbiome-targeted therapies' therapeutic potential. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to study the changes in SCFAs in IBD and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.
METHODS: The analysis employed a random-effects model to assess the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval. A literature search was conducted in databases from 2014 to 20 July 2024 to identify studies investigating SCFAs in IBD.
RESULTS: Subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction in fecal SCFA levels-specifically butyrate, acetate, and propionate-in all IBD subgroups compared to healthy controls. Active IBD showed a greater decrease in butyrate (p = 0.004), and UC showed a notable reduction in propionate (p = 0.03). When comparing UC and CD, differences were observed mainly in propionate (SMD = -0.76, p = 0.00001). Dietary interventions in IBD patients led to increased SCFA levels, with butyrate showing the most improvement (SMD = 1.03), suggesting the potential therapeutic value of dietary modulation.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates a significant reduction in fecal SCFA levels in patients with IBD, particularly during active phases of the disease and most markedly in CD.",Chulenbayeva L; Jarmukhanov Z; Kaliyekova K; Kozhakhmetov S; Kushugulova A,2025,Biomolecules,15,7,,10.3390/biom15071017,"Chulenbayeva, L., Jarmukhanov, Z., Kaliyekova, K., Kozhakhmetov, S., & Kushugulova, A.

38994933,Ca2+-Dependent Processes of Innate Immunity in IBD.,"IBD is an uncontrolled inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract, which mainly manifests in two forms: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis of IBD appears to be associated with an abnormal response of innate and adaptive immune cells. Innate immunity cells, such as macrophages, mast cells, and granulocytes, can produce proinflammatory (e.g., TNF-α) and oxidative stress (ROS) mediators promoting intestinal damage, and their abnormal responses can induce an imbalance in adaptive immunity, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines that increase innate immune damage, abate intestinal barrier functions, and aggravate inflammation. Considering that Ca2+ signalling plays a key role in a plethora of cellular functions, this review has the purpose of deepening the potential Ca2+ involvement in IBD pathogenesis.",Palestra F; Memoli G; Ventrici A; Trocchia M; Galdiero M; Varricchi G; Loffredo S,2024,Cells,13,13,,10.3390/cells13131079,"Palestra, F., Memoli, G., Ventrici, A., Trocchia, M., Galdiero, M., Varricchi, G., & Loffredo, S.

37140025,Remote care through telehealth for people with inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require intensive follow-up with frequent consultations after diagnosis. IBD telehealth management includes consulting by phone, instant messenger, video, text message, or web-based services. Telehealth can be beneficial for people with IBD, but may have its own set of challenges. It is important to systematically review the evidence on the types of remote or telehealth approaches that can be deployed in IBD. This is particularly relevant following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which led to increased self- and remote-management.
OBJECTIVES: To identify the communication technologies used to achieve remote healthcare for people with inflammatory bowel disease and to assess their effectiveness.
SEARCH METHODS: On 13 January 2022, we searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, three other databases, and three trials registries with no limitations on language, date, document type, or publication status.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated telehealth interventions targeted at people with IBD versus any other type of intervention or no intervention. We did not include studies based on digital patient information resources or education resources, unless they formed part of a wider package including an element of telehealth. We excluded studies where remote monitoring of blood or faecal tests was the only form of monitoring.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed their risk of bias. We analysed studies on adult and paediatric populations separately. We expressed the effects of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and the effects of continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), each with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs with a total of 3489 randomised participants, aged eight to 95 years. Three studies examined only people with ulcerative colitis (UC), two studies examined only people with Crohn's disease (CD), and the remaining studies examined a mix of IBD patients. Studies considered a range of disease activity states. The length of the interventions ranged from six months to two years. The telehealth interventions were web-based and telephone-based. Web-based monitoring versus usual care Twelve studies compared web-based disease monitoring to usual care. Three studies, all in adults, provided data on disease activity. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 254) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 174) in reducing disease activity in people with IBD (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.29). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. Five studies on adults provided dichotomous data that we could use for a meta-analysis on flare-ups. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 207/496) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 150/372) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with IBD (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided continuous data. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 465) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 444) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with CD (MD 0.00 events, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided dichotomous data on flare-ups in a paediatric population. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 28/84) may be equivalent to usual care (n = 29/86) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in children with IBD (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.51). The certainty of the evidence is low. Four studies, all in adults, provided data on quality of life. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 594) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 505) for quality of life in adults with IBD (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.20). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. Based on continuous data from one study in adults, we found that web-based disease monitoring probably leads to slightly higher medication adherence compared to usual care (MD 0.24 points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47). The results are of moderate certainty. Based on continuous data from one paediatric study, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63), although the evidence is very uncertain. When we meta-analysed dichotomous data from two studies on adults, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21), although the evidence is very uncertain. We were unable to draw any conclusions on the effects of web-based disease monitoring compared to usual care on healthcare access, participant engagement, attendance rate, interactions with healthcare professionals, and cost- or time-effectiveness. The certainty of the evidence is very low.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in this review suggests that web-based disease monitoring is probably no different to standard care in adults when considering disease activity, occurrence of flare-ups or relapse, and quality of life. There may be no difference in these outcomes in children, but the evidence is limited. Web-based monitoring probably increases medication adherence slightly compared to usual care. We are uncertain about the effects of web-based monitoring versus usual care on our other secondary outcomes, and about the effects of the other telehealth interventions included in our review, because the evidence is limited. Further studies comparing web-based disease monitoring to standard care for the clinical outcomes reported in adults are unlikely to change our conclusions, unless they have longer follow-up or investigate under-reported outcomes or populations. Studies with a clearer definition of web-based monitoring would enhance applicability, enable practical dissemination and replication, and enable alignment with areas identified as important by stakeholders and people affected by IBD.",Gordon M; Sinopoulou V; Lakunina S; Gjuladin-Hellon T; Bracewell K; Akobeng AK,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,5,5,CD014821,10.1002/14651858.CD014821.pub2,"Gordon, M., Sinopoulou, V., Lakunina, S., Gjuladin-Hellon, T., Bracewell, K., & Akobeng, A.

33160250,De-escalation of medical therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Treatment strategies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) now increasingly target deep remission, yet the resultant more aggressive use of medical therapy is associated with potentially serious adverse events and significant costs. It is, therefore, of vital importance to consider when, how and in whom medical therapy may be safely de-escalated. This issue is of great potential relevance in the current SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. In this review, we first discuss the rationale for drug withdrawal in IBD, before considering the available data on withdrawal of 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), immunomodulators (IM) and biological therapy in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). We consider how to identify patients most appropriate for drug withdrawal and outline a potential monitoring strategy for the early detection of relapse following drug withdrawal.

39594627,Mechanisms of Insulin Signaling as a Potential Therapeutic Method in Intestinal Diseases.,"Gastrointestinal diseases are becoming a growing public health problem. One of them is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The incidence of IBD is increasing in developing countries and declining in developed countries, affecting people of all ages. Researchers have been exploring new treatment options including insulin signaling pathways in the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It seems that a better understanding of the mechanism of IGF-1, GLP-1 and TL1A on the gut microbiota and inflammation may provide new advances in future therapeutic strategies for patients with IBD, but also other intestinal diseases. This review aims to synthesize insights into the effects of GLP, IGF and anti-TL1A on inflammation and the gut microbiota, which may enable their future use in therapy for people with intestinal diseases.",Jarmakiewicz-Czaja S; Sokal-Dembowska A; Ferenc K; Filip R,2024,Cells,13,22,,10.3390/cells13221879,"Jarmakiewicz-Czaja, S., Sokal-Dembowska, A., Ferenc, K., & Filip, R.

40881709,"The predictive role of peripheral serum inflammatory markers NLR, PLR, and LMR in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) are peripheral serum markers commonly utilized as cost-effective indicators of inflammation. However, their efficacy as predictors of clinical disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), remains uncertain. To address this ambiguity, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical significance of NLR, PLR, and LMR in patients with IBD.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases, with the last search date being October 2024. Baseline values of NLR, PLR, and LMR during active and remission phases, as well as moderate and severe conditions, were analyzed as primary endpoints in patients with IBD compared to healthy populations, using risk ratios (WMD) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates.
RESULTS: Twenty-three cohort studies involving 3550 IBD patients and 1010 healthy people were finally included in this meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that peripheral serum NLR and PLR were significantly higher in IBD patients than in the healthy population NLR [WMD=1.57,95%CI(1.14,2.01),P<0.001], PLR [WMD=60.66,95%CI(51.68,69.64),P<0.001]; NLR in active versus remission stage of IBD, PLR, LMR had significant differences NLR [WMD=1.50,95%CI(1.23,1.78),P<0.001], PLR [WMD=69.02,95%CI(39.66,98.39,P<0.001], LMR [WMD=-1.14,95%CI(-1.43,-0.86,P<0.001]; IBD active period and remission period NLR, PLR and LMR had significant differences. 0.001]; there were significant differences in NLR and PLR between moderate and severe IBD NLR [WMD=-1.41,95%CI(-2.13,-0.69),P<0.001], PLR [WMD=-112.03,95%CI(-143.87,-80.19),P<0.001]; the diagnostic accuracy of markers in predicting the clinical activity of IBD was relatively good. The diagnostic accuracy of markers in predicting IBD clinical activity was more favorable AUC [ES=0.72,95%CI(0.69,0.75),P<0.001].
CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD, elevated NLR and PLR are associated with increased disease activity and severity in UC and CD. Conversely, an elevated LMR is linked to reduced disease activity in IBD. Based on diagnostic accuracy results, inflammatory markers NLR and PLR serve as effective biomarkers for assessing IBD activity, thereby providing valuable insights for treatment decisions in IBD patients. However, LMR may not be a reliable independent marker due to conflicting or non-significant results. We anticipate that further high-quality prospective studies will validate our findings in the future.

32282548,"Small molecule drugs in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases: which one, when and why? - a systematic review.","In the 'treat-to-target' era of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, small molecule drugs (SMDs) represent a promising alternative to biomolecular drugs. Moreover, increasing failure rates of anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents have contributed to the development of new molecules with different mechanisms of action and bioavailability. This review focuses on the positioning of new, orally targeted therapies in the treatment algorithm of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), with special consideration to their efficacy and safety. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed and clinical trial registries to identify randomized controlled trials assessing SMDs in adult patients with moderate-to-severe IBD, irrespective of previous exposure to other biologics. In this review, we included 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of Janus kinase inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators (S1P), SMAD blockers, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors and α-4 antagonists. The primary endpoints in UC were achieved for tofacitinib in the phase III OCTAVE study and AJM-300, with a favorable safety profile. S1P receptor agonists, such as etrasimod and ozanimod, demonstrated favorable results in induction studies. For CD, filgotinib and upadacitinib also met the primary outcome criteria.

39871958,Neutrophils: From Inflammatory Bowel Disease to Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a non-specific inflammatory disease of digestive tract, primarily manifesting as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The precise etiology of IBD remains elusive. The interplay of genetic factors, environmental influences, and intestinal microbiota contributes to the establishment of an uncontrolled immune environment within the intestine, which can progressively lead to atypical hyperplasia and ultimately to malignancy over a long period. This colorectal malignant tumor that arises from chronic IBD is referred to as colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Dysregulation in the quantity and functionality of neutrophils plays a significant role in the onset, progression, and recurrence of IBD, as well as in the transition from IBD to CAC. Neutrophils affect the pathophysiology of IBD through various mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, the release of inflammatory mediators and chemokines, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These processes can induce DNA mutations, thereby facilitating the development of colon cancer. Given the incomplete understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying IBD and CAC, effective treatment and prevention strategies remain challenging. Consequently, a comprehensive review of the functional roles of neutrophils in IBD and CAC is essential for advancing our understanding of IBD pathogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.",Chen T; Liu J; Hang R; Chen Q; Wang D,2025,Journal of inflammation research,18,,925-947,10.2147/JIR.S497701,"Chen, T., Liu, J., Hang, R., Chen, Q., & Wang, D.

32758015,Endoscopy after surgery in inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease recurrence and pouch surveillance.,"INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are immune-mediated disorders characterized by a chronic inflammation, with intermittent exacerbations of symptoms and inflammation. In both diseases, medical treatment has made revolutionary steps forward. Nevertheless, surgery is still required in many cases due to inefficacy of multiple medical therapies. It is not clear whether surgery rates in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are currently decreasing despite all improvements.
AREAS COVERED: Multidisciplinary management is critical in surgical patients to improve long-term outcomes. Endoscopy plays a crucial role, both before and after surgery, in planning therapeutic strategies and stratifying risk of recurrence. Aim of this review is to provide a deeper insight into the central role of endoscopy in the postoperative management of IBD patients, focusing on recent research advances, future challenges and unresolved questions.
EXPERT OPINION: Both UC and CD surgical patients need endoscopy to define the correct therapeutic choice, predict subsequent disease course and adopt the correct surveillance strategy. In the next future, newer endoscopic techniques could be systematically applied in IBD patients after surgery, to assess early postoperative inflammation, response to treatment, or, regarding UC, to provide enhanced pouch surveillance, allowing for early detection of inflammation and dysplasia.",Vespa E; Furfaro F; Allocca M; Fiorino G; Correale C; Gilardi D; Argollo M; Zilli A; Zacharopoulou E; Loy L; Danese S,2020,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,14,9,829-841,10.1080/17474124.2020.1807325,"Vespa, E., Furfaro, F., Allocca, M., Fiorino, G., Correale, C., Gilardi, D., Argollo, M., Zilli, A., Zacharopoulou, E., Loy, L., & Danese, S.

32498475,Biochemical Biomarkers of Mucosal Healing for Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Adults.,"Mucosal healing (MH) is the key therapeutic target of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The evaluation of MH remains challenging, with endoscopy being the golden standard. We performed a comprehensive overview of the performance of fecal-, serum-, and urine-based biochemical markers in colonic IBD to find out whether we are ready to replace endoscopy with a non-invasive but equally accurate instrument. A Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus search of original articles as potential MH markers in adults, published between January 2009 and March 2020, was conducted. Finally, 84 eligible studies were identified. The most frequently studied fecal marker was calprotectin (44 studies), with areas under the curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.70 to 0.99 in ulcerative colitis (UC) and from 0.70 to 0.94 in Crohn`s disease (CD), followed by lactoferrin (4 studies), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (3 studies), and lipocalin-2 (3 studies). The most frequently studied serum marker was C-reactive protein (30 studies), with AUCs ranging from 0.60 to 0.96 in UC and from 0.64 to 0.93 in CD. Fecal calprotectin is an accurate MH marker in IBD in adults; however, it cannot replace endoscopy and the application of calprotectin is hampered by the lack of standardization concerning the cut-off value.

40713669,Role of adiponectin and its receptors AdipoR1/2 in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Intake of nutrients and water from diet to maintain life, a typical physiological function of gut, is highly dependent on the extensive immune network, whose imbalance is easy to induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Clinical strategies to completely cure IBD are poor, so it is urgent to develop novel drugs or targets. Adiponectin (APN), an adipokine from adipocytes, regulates energy metabolism and immune response. High levels APN are inversely associated with CD severity UC colonic fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which APN interferes with IBD remains unclear. This review aims to analyze correlation and molecular mechanism between APN and IBD. APN and AdipoR2 proteins are highly expressed in colon which is a primary organ of IBD, and the target intersection of APN and IBD is huge. APN may interfere with lipid metabolism in IBD individuals through AdipoR1/2, but regulates neural and peripheral immune by AdipoR1 but not AdipoR2 and mediates nutritional and energy homeostasis through AdipoR2 rather than AdipoR1. Besides, APN mediates CRP and IL-6 through AdipoR1/2, AMPK and TNF-α through AdipoR1 and PI3K-Akt, PPARA and PPARG through AdipoR2 to affect IBD progression, which depends on direct interaction between APPL1 and AdipoR1/2. Unexpectedly, AMPK and TNF-α may also interact directly with AdipoR1. APN regulates CD through AdipoR1/2-metabolism process and UC through AdipoR1-inflammation axis or AdipoR2-fibrosis process. APN analogues or AdipoRon which is a dual agonist of AdipoR1/2 potentially reduces colonic fibrosis in UC and fistulae in CD, promotes mucosal healing, repairs intestinal microbiota homeostasis and increases autophagy to alleviate IBD symptoms by weakening TNF-α, IL-6, NLRP3, TGFB1 activities and aggrandizing P-AKT, PPARA, PPARG, INS, IRS1/2, IGF-1, TIMP1, NOD2, SIRT1 levels.",Zhu Q; Jia X; Li S; Feng J,2025,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,23,1,356,10.1186/s12964-025-02359-w,"Zhu, Q., Jia, X., Li, S., & Feng, J.

39597084,A Review of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Children-Exploring Its Role in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Background and Objectives: There is an increasing use of fecal matter transplantation (FMT) worldwide as research into the impact of the gut microbiome in various disease states is growing. FMT is the transfer of stool from a healthy human donor to a patient for the purpose of restoring intestinal dysbiosis. This review will assess the efficacy and safety of FMT in the treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and explore the future directions of the use of FMT in children. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was performed where a literature search of publications published prior to 15 September 2023 was performed. Efficacy outcomes and safety data as well as microbiome analysis were reviewed from the studies where applicable. Results: Nine studies on UC and two studies on CD satisfied eligibility criteria and individually analysed. Most of the studies provided microbiome analyses. Conclusions: FMT is a safe treatment for paediatric IBD, and is shown to be effective in inducing clinical response by some studies. However the lack of randomized controlled trials limited the results of our study.",Ko Y; Alaedin S; Fernando D; Zhou J; Ho V,2024,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",60,11,,10.3390/medicina60111899,"Ko, Y., Alaedin, S., Fernando, D., Zhou, J., & Ho, V.

33553076,The Oral Microbiome in Pediatric IBD: A Source of Pathobionts or Biomarkers?,"The oral cavity is continuous with the gastrointestinal tract and in children, oral health may be closely linked with the overall health of the GI tract. In the case of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), oral manifestations are an important clinical indicator of intestinal disease. Recent studies of the microbiome in IBD suggest that translocation of oral microbes to the gut may be a common feature of the microbial dysbiosis which is a signature of both CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). Murine studies suggest that translocation of oral bacteria and yeasts to the lower GI tract may trigger inflammation in susceptible hosts, providing a mechanistic link to the development of IBD. Conversely, some studies have shown that dysbiosis of the oral microbiome may occur, possibly as a result of inflammatory responses and could represent a useful source of biomarkers of GI health. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the oral microbiome in IBD and presents current hypotheses on the potential role of this community in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",Elmaghrawy K; Hussey S; Moran GP,2020,Frontiers in pediatrics,8,,620254,10.3389/fped.2020.620254,"Elmaghrawy, K., Hussey, S., & Moran, G.

36672491,Therapeutic Management of Adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Malignancies: A Clinical Challenge.,"Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have increased risk of developing intestinal and extraintestinal cancers. However, once a diagnosis of malignancy is made, the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) can be challenging as major guidelines suggest discontinuing the ongoing immunosuppressant and biological therapies for at least 2-5 years after the end of cancer treatment. Recently, new molecules such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab have been approved for IBD and limited data exist on the real risk of new or recurrent cancer in IBD patients with prior cancer, exposed to immunosuppressants and biologic agents. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach and case-by-case management is the preferred choice. The primary aim of our review was to summarize the current evidence about the safety of reintroducing an immunosuppressant or biologic agent in patients with a history of malignancy and to compare the different available therapies, including gut-selective agents. The secondary aim was to evaluate the clinical course of the IBD patients under cancer treatment who do not receive any specific immunosuppressant treatment after the diagnosis of cancer.",Ferretti F; Cannatelli R; Maconi G; Ardizzone S,2023,Cancers,15,2,,10.3390/cancers15020542,"Ferretti, F., Cannatelli, R., Maconi, G., & Ardizzone, S.

40225345,The emerging role of honeysuckle flower in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pose considerable challenges in treatment because they are chronic conditions that easily relapse. The occurrence of IBD continues to rise in developing countries. Nonetheless, the existing therapies for IBD have limitations and fail to address the needs of the patients thoroughly. There is an increasing need for new, safe, and highly effective alternative medications for IBD patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is employed in drug development and disease management due to its wide-range of biological activities, minimal toxicity, and limited side effects. Extensive research has shown that certain TCM exhibits significant therapeutic benefits for IBD treatments. Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) was used in TCM research and clinical settings for the treatment of IBD. Bioactive metabolites in L. japonica, such as luteolin, quercetin, cyanidin, chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), and saponin, exhibit significant therapeutic benefits for managing IBD. The honeysuckle flower is a potential candidate in the treatment of IBD due to its anti-inflammatory, immune system-regulating, and antioxidant qualities. This paper reviews the metabolites of the honeysuckle flower as a candidate for the treatment of IBD. It discusses the fundamental mechanism of L. japonica and the potential of its bioactive metabolites in the prevention and treatment of IBD.",Muro P; Jing C; Zhao Z; Jin T; Mao F,2025,Frontiers in nutrition,12,,1525675,10.3389/fnut.2025.1525675,"Muro, P., Jing, C., Zhao, Z., Jin, T., & Mao, F.

38314171,Is the Mediterranean Diet in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Ready for Prime Time?,"BACKGROUND: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), specifically in the developing world, suggests an important environmental effect. Amongst environmental influences, dietary factors, particularly the adoption of a westernized diet, have been specifically noticed. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet (MED), characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and moderate consumption of animal and ultra processed foods, has shown potential positive effects in IBD.
METHODS: Here we conducted a narrative review focusing on the evidence regarding the role of MED in IBD prevention and management.
RESULTS: Epidemiological studies suggest inverse association of MED with CD development. Furthermore, adherence to MED has been associated with clinical improvement in active CD and maintenance of lower levels of inflammatory markers in UC, along with improved quality of life and lower mortality rates in IBD patients. Mechanistically, MED promotes a diverse and beneficial gut microbiota, possesses anti-inflammatory properties through polyphenols and dietary fats, and may modulate oxidative stress. In clinical practice, MED may be adapted to diverse disease phenotypes and cultural preferences, and is a sustainable, easy to maintain dietary approach.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence may support the integration of MED into clinical practice in IBD care. In future research, the efficacy of MED in specific IBD phenotypes should be assessed.",Godny L; Dotan I,2024,Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,7,1,97-103,10.1093/jcag/gwad041,"Godny, L., & Dotan, I.

33634430,Increased Risk of Infections with Anti-TNF Agents in Patients with Crohn's Disease After Elective Surgery: Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative complication rates in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving preoperative biologics have been analyzed without considering the surgical context. Emergency surgery may be associated with an increased risk of infectious complications, compared to elective operations.
AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the relationship between preoperative biologic therapy and postoperative outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), focusing on elective surgery.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to February 12, 2020, for studies of patients with IBD undergoing elective abdominal surgery receiving biologic therapy within 3 months before surgery compared to no therapy, or another biologic therapy. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. The primary outcomes were the rate of infections and total complications within 30 days. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included. Preoperative treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in patients with CD undergoing elective surgery was associated with increased odds of infection (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.40-3.01), but not total complications (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.71-1.51). In elective surgery for UC, preoperative anti-TNF therapy was not associated with infectious (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.34-3.07) or total complications (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.29-1.58). Limited data indicate that emergency surgery did not significantly affect the rate of complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy prior to elective surgery may increase the odds of postoperative infection in CD, although the certainty of evidence is very low. More evidence is needed, particularly for newer biologics.",Hanzel J; Almradi A; Istl AC; Yang ML; Fleshner KA; Parker CE; Guizzetti L; Ma C; Singh S; Jairath V,2022,Digestive diseases and sciences,67,2,646-660,10.1007/s10620-021-06895-6,"Hanzel, J., Almradi, A., Istl, A.

35456656,Plant-Derived Exosomes as a Drug-Delivery Approach for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colitis-Associated Cancer.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic recurrent intestinal disease and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the complex etiology of colitis, the current treatments of IBD are quite limited and are mainly concentrated on the remission of the disease. In addition, the side effects of conventional drugs on the body cannot be ignored. IBD also has a certain relationship with colitis-associated cancer (CAC), and inflammatory cells can produce a large number of tumor-promoting cytokines to promote tumor progression. In recent years, exosomes from plants have been found to have the ability to load drugs to target the intestine and have great potential for the treatment of intestinal diseases. This plant-derived exosome-targeting delivery system can load chemical or nucleic acid drugs and deliver them to intestinal inflammatory sites stably and efficiently. This review summarizes the pathophysiological characteristics of IBD and CAC as well as the application and prospect of plant exosomes in the treatment of IBD and CAC.",Cai Y; Zhang L; Zhang Y; Lu R,2022,Pharmaceutics,14,4,,10.3390/pharmaceutics14040822,"Cai, Y., Zhang, L., Zhang, Y., & Lu, R.

32424656,Update on therapeutic management of spondyloarthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease.,"Management of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains a challenging task that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Separate guidelines for each disease are well-established. However, the management of SpA co-occurring with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) has hardly been studied. There are few specific reports that focus on this therapeutic area. The main issue is that some therapeutic options used to treat one disease can negatively influence the other disease course. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic alternatives that would allow for the appropriate management of patients with both SpA and IBD. Key Points • Collaboration between gastroenterologists and rheumatologists is recommended to improve the management of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). • When treating SpA occurring simultaneously with IBD, it would be appropriate to give priority to the active disease. • Considering its well-proven efficacy in both conditions, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy remains the corner stone in the treatment of these patients. • Other therapeutic options such as Janus kinases (JAK) inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-12 inhibitors, and vedolizumab are still under investigation.",Ben Nessib D; Ferjani H; Maatallah K; Rahmouni S; Kaffel D; Hamdi W,2020,Clinical rheumatology,39,12,3543-3553,10.1007/s10067-020-05136-x,"Ben Nessib, D., Ferjani, H., Maatallah, K., Rahmouni, S., Kaffel, D., & Hamdi, W.

36106049,A Literature Review of Ozanimod Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: From Concept to Practical Application.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD), is believed to be due to a dysregulation of the innate immune response. The complexity of the immune cascade offers both a challenge and an opportunity to researchers seeking out new treatments for IBD, as various points along the inflammatory pathways can be targeted for interruption. Sphinogosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a phospholipid molecule with wide ranging biological effects caused by binding five known S1P receptor subtypes. Ozanimod is a small molecule drug that selectively targets S1P receptors 1 and 5 which play a crucial role in lymphocyte trafficking. In clinical trials for both UC and CD, it has been shown to induce a reversible lymphopenia which correlates with response to therapy. Reported adverse events include infection, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Rare instances of bradycardia, heart block, and macular edema were also reported. As a newly available therapy approved for UC patients, we aim to summarize ozanimod's novel mechanism of action, pre-clinical and clinical trial results, and to give context to this newly available drug that gastroenterologists may utilize in their treatment algorithm.",Becher N; Swaminath A; Sultan K,2022,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,18,,913-927,10.2147/TCRM.S336139,"Becher, N., Swaminath, A., & Sultan, K.

39274415,Imaging of Ulcerative Colitis: The Role of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a promising and appealing alternative to endoscopy in the objective assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a specialized imaging technique that enables the mapping of water molecule diffusion within biological tissues, eliminating the need for intravenous gadolinium contrast injection. It is expanding the capability of traditional MRI sequences in Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Recently, there has been growing interest in the application of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging in the field of IBD. This technique combines diffusion and perfusion information, making it a valuable tool for assessing IBD treatment response. Previous studies have extensively studied the use of DWI techniques for evaluating the severity of activity in IBD. However, the majority of these studies have primarily focused on Crohn's disease (CD), with only a limited number of reports specifically examining UC. Therefore, this review briefly introduces the basics of DWI and IVIM imaging and conducts a review of relevant studies that have investigated its application in UC to show whether these techniques are useful techniques for evaluating patients with UC in terms of detection, characterization, and quantification of disease activity. Through the extensive literature survey, most of these studies indicate that DWI proves valuable in the differential diagnosis of UC and could be used as an effective modality for staging UC.",Alyami AS,2024,Journal of clinical medicine,13,17,,10.3390/jcm13175204,"Alyami, A.

36145514,"Under the Umbrella of Clinical Pharmacology: Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Infliximab and Adalimumab, and a Bridge to an Era of Biosimilars.","Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have revolutionized the treatment of many chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a term that comprises two quite similar, yet distinctive, disorders-Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Two blockbuster MAbs, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL), transformed the pharmacological approach of treating CD and UC. However, due to the complex interplay of pharmacology and immunology, MAbs face challenges related to their immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety. To ease the burden of IBD and other severe diseases, biosimilars have emerged as a cost-effective alternative to an originator product. According to the current knowledge, biosimilars of IFX and ADL in IBD patients are shown to be as safe and effective as their originators. The future of biosimilars, in general, is promising due to the potential of making the health care system more sustainable. However, their use is accompanied by misconceptions regarding their effectiveness and safety, as well as by controversy regarding their interchangeability.

33050496,Salivary Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review.,"Saliva as a biological fluid has a remarkable potential in the non-invasive diagnostics of several systemic disorders. Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. This systematic review was designed to answer the question ""Are salivary biomarkers reliable for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases?"". Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eleven studies were included (according to PRISMA statement guidelines). Due to their heterogeneity, the potential salivary markers for IBD were divided into four groups: oxidative status markers, inflammatory cytokines, microRNAs and other biomarkers. Active CD patients manifest decreased activity of antioxidants (e.g., glutathione, catalase) and increased lipid peroxidation. Therefore, malondialdehyde seems to be a good diagnostic marker of CD. Moreover, elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin 1β, interleukin 6 or tumour necrosis factor α) are associated with the activity of IBD. Additionaly, selected miRNAs are altered in saliva (overexpressed miR-101 in CD; overexpressed miR-21, miR-31, miR-142-3p and underexpressed miR-142-5p in UC). Among other salivary biomarkers, exosomal PSMA7, α-amylase and calprotectin are detected. In conclusion, saliva contains several biomarkers which can be used credibly for the early diagnosis and regular monitoring of IBD. However, further investigations are necessary to validate these findings, as well as to identify new reliable salivary biomarkers.",Nijakowski K; Surdacka A,2020,International journal of molecular sciences,21,20,,10.3390/ijms21207477,"Nijakowski, K., & Surdacka, A.

Current treatments for IBD, predominantly small molecule therapies, impose significant economic burdens. Drug repurposing offers a cost-effective alternative, leveraging existing drugs for novel therapeutic applications. This approach capitalizes on shared molecular pathways across diseases, accelerating therapeutic discovery while minimizing costs and risks.

The developmental origin of disease concept provides a theoretical framework by which the complex interplay between environmental factors and host cells, particularly during vulnerable time periods, ultimately cause disease, such as IBD. Epigenetics has been proposed as the underlying mechanism within this concept, turning environmental triggers into stable changes of cellular function. Adding further to the complexity of IBD is the gut microbiome, which is equally responsive to the environment, and can impact host cell function, where recent findings underscore the stochastic and individualized nature of such effects. We review the microbiome literature through a novel triple environmental hit concept (priming, modulation, and trigger) of IBD pathogenesis. We propose that there are at least 3 distinct stages during an individual's lifespan where random/stochastic events driven by environmental influences are necessary for ultimately developing IBD. By this means, we speculate that microbiome-directed therapeutics carry potential for individualized prevention and dynamic treatment of IBD.",Kellermayer R; Zilbauer M,2020,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,71,5,589-595,10.1097/MPG.0000000000002908,"Kellermayer, R., & Zilbauer, M.

Over the last two decades, numerous medications have been developed and repurposed to induce and maintain remission in IBD patients. Despite the approval of multiple drugs, the major recurring issues continue to be primary non-response and secondary loss of response, as well as short- and long-term adverse events. Most clinical trials show percentages of response under 60%, possibly as a consequence of strict inclusion criteria and definitions of response. That is why these percentages appear to be more optimistic in real-life studies. A therapeutic ceiling has been used as a term to define this invisible bar that has not been crossed by any drug yet. This review highlights novel therapeutic target agents in phases II and III of development, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, selective Janus kinase inhibitors, anti-interleukins, and other small molecules that are currently under research until 1 January 2023.

These conditions are believed to arise in genetically predisposed individuals who develop an exaggerated immune response to the intestinal microbiota. A timely and accurate diagnosis of IBD is essential because diagnostic delays can result in intestinal damage that is irreversible, leading in some cases to intestinal dysfunction and the need for surgery. Diagnostic delays are common in cases when GI symptoms are mild and nonspecific. When IBD is suspected, the common diagnostic algorithm includes laboratory analyses, cross-sectional radiologic imaging, and endoscopy with biopsy and histological analysis. Other diagnostic biomarkers, including those found in the serum, stool, and urine, have also been evaluated in IBD. Newer artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies are now being developed, and these will likely play an important future role in the diagnosis and management of IBD.",Kaz AM; Venu N,2025,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",15,11,,10.3390/diagnostics15111303,"Kaz, A.

33576711,"Inflammatory bowel disease: tri-directional relationship between microbiota, immune system and intestinal epithelium.","Human gut microbiota contributes to host nutrition and metabolism, sustains intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, and modulates host immune system. The alterations in their composition lead to severe gut disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are gamut of chronic inflammatory disorders of gut, mediated by complex interrelations among genetic, environmental, and internal factors. IBD has debateable aetiology, however in recent years, exploring the central role of a tri-directional relationship between gut microbiota, mucosal immune system, and intestinal epithelium in pathogenesis is getting the most attention. Increasing incidences and early onset explains the exponential rise in IBD burden on health-care systems. Industrialization, hypersensitivity to allergens, lifestyle, hygiene hypothesis, loss of intestinal worms, and gut microbial composition, explains this shifted rise. Hitherto, the interventions modulating gut microbiota composition, microfluidics-based in vitro gastrointestinal models, non-allergic functional foods, nutraceuticals, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors are some of the futuristic approaches for the disease management.",Ahlawat S; Kumar P; Mohan H; Goyal S; Sharma KK,2021,Critical reviews in microbiology,47,2,254-273,10.1080/1040841X.2021.1876631,"Ahlawat, S., Kumar, P., Mohan, H., Goyal, S., & Sharma, K.

32230977,Single-Cell Protein and RNA Expression Analysis of Mononuclear Phagocytes in Intestinal Mucosa and Mesenteric Lymph Nodes of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Patients.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are driven by an abnormal immune response to commensal microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts. In addition to epithelial and stromal cells, innate and adaptive immune systems are both involved in IBD immunopathogenesis. Given the advances driven by single-cell technologies, we here reviewed the immune landscape and function of mononuclear phagocytes in inflamed non-lymphoid and lymphoid tissues of CD and UC patients. Immune cell profiling of IBD tissues using scRNA sequencing combined with multi-color cytometry analysis identifies unique clusters of monocyte-like cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These clusters reflect either distinct cell lineages (nature), or distinct or intermediate cell types with identical ontogeny, adapting their phenotype and function to the surrounding milieu (nurture and tissue imprinting). These advanced technologies will provide an unprecedented view of immune cell networks in health and disease, and thus may offer a personalized medicine approach to patients with IBD.",Chapuy L; Sarfati M,2020,Cells,9,4,,10.3390/cells9040813,"Chapuy, L., & Sarfati, M.

38418112,Occurrence of Colorectal Cancer After a Negative Colonoscopy in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite the application of colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance guidelines, the detection of early neoplastic lesions might be difficult in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To explore the risk of post-colonoscopy CRC (PCCRC) in patients with IBD we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed (PROSPERO; no. CRD42023453049). We included studies reporting the 3-year PCCRC (PCCRC-3y) prevalence, according to World Endoscopy Organization (WEO)-endorsed definition, in IBD and non-IBD patients. As primary outcome we evaluated the PCCRC-3y prevalence, according to WEO definitions, in IBD- and non-IBD patients and calculated the odds ratio (OR). The secondary outcome was to assess risk factors for PCCRC development in IBD patients.
RESULTS: Three retrospective observational cohort studies were included. The pooled PCCRC-3y rate in patients with IBD was 30.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=24.4-37.5%] and in non-IBD patients was 6.8% (95%CI=6.2-7.4%). The PCCRC-3y occurrence in IBD patients was significantly higher than that in non-IBD patients (OR=6.04; 95%CI=4.04-9.4; I2=95%), but a high heterogeneity among studies was noted. Furthermore, patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) had a significantly higher prevalence of PCCRC than patients with Crohn's Disease (CD): 30.9% (95%CI=27.8-34.2%) vs. 22.3% (95%CI=18-27%), respectively (OR=1.6, 95%CI=1.2-2.2; I2=0%).
CONCLUSION: One-third of CRC in IBD patients were PCCRC, and these numbers were significantly higher when compared with those in non-IBD patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of PCCRC in patients with UC was higher compared to those with CD. However, prospective studies are required to better characterize risk factors for PCCRC development in patients with IBD.",Scotti GB; Iannone I; DE Padua C; Crocetti D; Fiori G; Sapienza P; Fiori E; Avenia S; Lamazza A,2024,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",38,2,523-530,10.21873/invivo.13470,"Scotti, G.

39339221,Advancements in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Management: From Traditional Treatments to Monoclonal Antibodies and Future Drug Delivery Systems.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with two main subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis involves genetic predisposition, dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation. Complications include perianal lesions, strictures, fistulas, perforations, and an increased risk of colon cancer. Clinical classification ranges from mild to fulminant and recurrent disease, with common symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and weight loss. Extraintestinal manifestations include arthritis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and uveitis. Conventional treatments using aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators have limitations. Biologics, introduced in the 1990s, offer improved efficacy and specificity, targeting factors like TNF-α, integrins, and cytokines. Monoclonal antibodies play a crucial role in IBD management, aiming to reduce relapses, hospitalizations, and surgeries. In conclusion, this review is aimed at summarizing the latest knowledge, advantages, and drawbacks of IBD therapies, such as small molecules, biologics, and monoclonal antibodies, to provide a basis for further research in the IBD field.",Di Rienzo A; Marinelli L; Dimmito MP; Toto EC; Di Stefano A; Cacciatore I,2024,Pharmaceutics,16,9,,10.3390/pharmaceutics16091185,"Di Rienzo, A., Marinelli, L., Dimmito, M.

35543893,Reflecting on the immunopathology of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease: what do we know and what should we know?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is clinically closely associated with arthritis. Three major arthritis clinical subtypes have been described, peripheral arthritis type 1 (PeA1), peripheral arthritis type 2 (PeA2), and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). While genetic overlaps between IBD and arthritis have been defined, detailed pathophysiology for these three major subtypes of arthritis in patients with IBD has only recently begun to be established. The genetic and molecular mechanisms distinguishing axial and peripheral arthropathies in patients with UC and CD need to be better described. Understanding the pathophysiology for PeA1, PeA2, and axSpA in the settings of both UC and CD is necessary to provide the fundamental biology underlying the clinical phenotypes in IBD arthritis. This has been attempted for CD-associated spondyloarthritis, differentiating this from both CD and axSpA, while observing unique peripheral blood mononuclear cells linking gut inflammation to joint disease. We should know more about the processes by which immune cells are perturbed in these disorders, how they translocate to joints, how they are activated, what other molecules and mediators are involved, and how gut microbes and microbial products damage joints. Information from such studies are needed to elucidate whether distinctions between IBD-related peripheral and axSpA are clinically meaningful. IBD-related peripheral and axSpA studies are needed to elucidate whether distinctions between peripheral and axSpA are clinically meaningful, to better understand immunopathogenesis, and to develop novel targeted therapies.",Amarnani A; Thakker S; Panush RS,2022,Clinical rheumatology,41,8,2581-2588,10.1007/s10067-022-06201-3,"Amarnani, A., Thakker, S., & Panush, R.

39924756,Association of Poor Sleep Quality With Adverse Outcomes in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic diseases with adverse events such as disease flare, progression, drug escalation, hospitalization, and surgery. Meanwhile, patients with IBD often have sleep disorders. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to investigate the relationship between sleep quality of patients with IBD and their prognosis.
METHODS: MEDLINE and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched for articles published up to November 2024. We pooled the hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for adverse outcome events during the follow-up period in patients with poor sleep quality at baseline compared with those with normal sleep quality.
RESULTS: Five studies were included with a total of 2333 patients with IBD. Poor sleep quality in patients with IBD was significantly correlated with the occurrence of adverse outcome events at follow-up (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.14-2.33). Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) with poor sleep quality had a significantly higher risk of adverse outcome events at follow-up (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.26-1.99), whereas those with ulcerative colitis (UC) did not (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.76-1.60).
CONCLUSION: Early identification of poor sleep quality in patients with IBD, especially CD, has a predictive effect on their prognosis.",Xu TY; Zhang Y; Zhao SL,2024,Journal of digestive diseases,25,11-12,664-673,10.1111/1751-2980.13328,"Xu, T.

34449288,Anti-integrin drugs in clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): insights into promising agents.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite huge and increasing developments in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a significant percentage of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is still in need of an effective and safe therapeutic option. Tackling the trafficking of leukocytes specifically within or directed to the inflamed gut appears to be a particularly promising strategy, and several new anti-integrin agents are currently under investigation in clinical trials.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes efficacy and safety data from phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials on investigational drugs, including monoclonal antibodies (etrolizumab, abrilumab, ontamalimab) and oral small molecules (AJM300, PTG-100). It also discusses the future perspectives for the treatment of IBD patients with this class of agents.
EXPERT OPINION: The pipeline of anti-integrin agents is well assorted, and it is reasonable to expect that some will be introduced in the market soon. Among the most exciting features of this class are the gut selectivity, the convenient subcutaneous and oral administrations and the reassuring safety profiles. Most of the new anti-integrins seem to improve outcomes in UC but not in CD, however these data are far from definitive and several pivotal trials are still under way.",Solitano V; Parigi TL; Ragaini E; Danese S,2021,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,30,10,1037-1046,10.1080/13543784.2021.1974396,"Solitano, V., Parigi, T.

39867090,Infliximab Precision Dosing in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Patients: A Review of Current Literature.,"The therapeutic failure of infliximab therapy remains a challenge in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and dose optimization is often required. Accelerated or intensified regimes showed value in treating patients in the acute setting with high CRP or low albumin levels, which are suggested by recent guidelines; however, evidence is weak. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) trough levels and antibodies, showed value during maintenance therapy, but not in induction and can guide clinical decisions in patients that might be undertreated with the standard dosing regimen. Combining the impact of therapeutic drug monitoring with a Bayesian forecasting methodology to calculate drug clearance can help on calculating the optimal infliximab dose for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) on both the induction and maintenance phase. This will help to identify those who need intensification of their current regime to boost the therapeutic effect and those who are non-responders. This review aims to summarize the recent literature regarding infliximab precision dosing in IBD patients using forecasting methodology.",Toskas A; Manti M; Kamperidis N; Arebi N,2024,Cureus,16,12,e76424,10.7759/cureus.76424,"Toskas, A., Manti, M., Kamperidis, N., & Arebi, N.

34899362,Intestinal Macrophage Autophagy and its Pharmacological Application in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders. IBD is regarded as a severe healthcare problem worldwide, with high morbidity and lethality. So far, despite of numerous studies on this issue, the specific mechanisms of IBD still remain unclarified and ideal treatments are not available for IBD. The intestinal mucosal barrier is vital for maintaining the function of the intestinal self-defensive system. Among all of the components, macrophage is an important one in the intestinal self-defensive system, normally protecting the gut against exotic invasion. However, the over-activation of macrophages in pathological conditions leads to the overwhelming induction of intestinal inflammatory and immune reaction, thus damaging the intestinal functions. Autophagy is an important catabolic mechanism. It has been proven to participate the regulation of various kinds of inflammation- and immune-related disorders via the regulation of inflammation in related cells. Here in this paper, we will review the role and mechanism of intestinal macrophage autophagy in IBD. In addition, several well-studied kinds of agents taking advantage of intestinal macrophage autophagy for the treatment of IBD will also be discussed. We aim to bring novel insights in the development of therapeutic strategies against IBD.",Zheng Y; Yu Y; Chen XF; Yang SL; Tang XL; Xiang ZG,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,803686,10.3389/fphar.2021.803686,"Zheng, Y., Yu, Y., Chen, X.

34196192,The Relationship Between Helicobacter pylori and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori may have a protective effect against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We integrated epidemiological data to identify the correlation between IBD and H. pylori. Moreover, we analyzed whether IBD medication and classification affect H. pylori, and whether eradication of H. pylori leads to recurrence of IBD.
METHODS: Articles published up to May 1, 2019, in three main databases including PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase, were searched. Study types included cross-sectional studies, retrospective studies and perspective studies, and data were combined and analyzed. Spearman correlation analysis and meta-analysis were performed after collecting and collating the relevant data. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were used to evaluate reliability and heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies on IBD prevalence, 127 studies on H. pylori prevalence, and 23 studies for meta-analysis were included. IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were negatively correlated to H. pylori prevalence (all P<0.001). The meta-analysis results showed that compared to controls, the odds of having H. pylori infection were 0.44, 0.36, 0.54 for IBD, CD and UC, respectively (OR=0.44, 95% CI=0.34-0.59; OR=0.36, 95% CI=0.26-0.49; OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.4-0.72). Moreover, IBD patients were 1.41 times (OR=1.41, 95% CI=1.25-1.58) more likely to relapse after eradication of H. pylori. Finally, H. pylori infection was not related to IBD medication and classification.
CONCLUSION: H. pylori prevalence was negatively correlated to IBD and H. pylori had a protective effect against IBD. Furthermore, eradication of H. pylori can lead to recurrence of IBD.",Zhong Y; Zhang Z; Lin Y; Wu L,2021,Archives of Iranian medicine,24,4,317-325,10.34172/aim.2021.44,"Zhong, Y., Zhang, Z., Lin, Y., & Wu, L.

38762503,Medical radiation exposure in inflammatory bowel disease: an updated meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There have been previous studies and earlier systematic review on the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and radiation exposure. With the diversification of current test methods, this study intended to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the IBD radiation exposure in recent years.
METHODS: Three databases (PUBMED, EMBASE, and MEDICINE) for relevant literature up to May 1, 2023 were searched. The statistical data meeting requirements were collated and extracted.
RESULTS: 20 papers were enrolled. The overall high radiation exposure rate was 15% (95% CI = [12%, 19%]) for CD and 5% (95% CI = [3%, 7%]) for UC. The pooled result found that high radiation exposure rate was 3.44 times higher in CD than in UC (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = [2.35, 5.02]). Moreover, the average radiation exposure level in CD was 12.77 mSv higher than that in UC (WMD = 12.77, 95% CI = [9.93, 15.62] mSv). Furthermore, radiation exposure level of CD after 2012 was higher than those before 2012 (26.42 ± 39.61vs. 23.76 ± 38.46 mSv, P = 0.016), while UC did not show similar result (11.99 ± 27.66 vs. 10.01 ± 30.76 mSv, P = 0.1). Through subgroup analysis, it was found that disease duration (WMD = 2.75, 95% CI = [0.10, 5.40] mSv), complications (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = [1.50, 17.29]), and surgical history (OR = 5.46, 95% CI = [1.51, 19.69]) significantly increased the proportion of high radiation exposure.
CONCLUSION: This study found that radiation exposure level of IBD patients was high, which revealed the radiation risk in the process of diagnosis and treatment of IBD patients. In the future, longer follow-up and prospective studies are needed to reveal the relationship between high radiation exposure and solid tumorigenesis.",Lu C; Yao X; Yu M; He X,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,173,10.1186/s12876-024-03264-1,"Lu, C., Yao, X., Yu, M., & He, X.

40603749,An Updated Meta-analysis of Pancreatic Cancer Risk in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the risk of developing pancreatic cancer (PC).
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHOD: We searched PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, and Scopus up until September 8, 2024. To evaluate heterogeneity among the studies, we used the chi-square test and the I2 statistic. An I2 value exceeding 50% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity. We calculated estimates of odds ratios (OR), relative risks (RR), and hazard ratios (HR), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The analysis was performed using a random-effects model. We established a significance level of less than 0.05 using Stata software, version 17.
RESULTS: We included a total of 17 studies in our analysis. Overall, patients with IBD showed a higher risk of developing PC, with an OR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.48-1.93). Specifically, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) had an OR of 1.25 (95% CI: 1.10-1.41), while those with ulcerative colitis (UC) had an OR = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.10-1.45). Furthermore, patients with IBD accompanied by primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) displayed a significantly higher risk, with an OR = 3.12 (95% CI: 1.67-5.85). Additionally, there was no evidence of publication bias across all subgroups. Although there was no publication bias, we conducted a trim-and-fill analysis to investigate the small study effect. This analysis revealed that the results were influenced by omitted studies and that the pooled effects would be diluted if the omitted studies were included in the meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: CD and UC are associated with an increased risk of PC, with no significant difference in risk levels between the two conditions. However, having IIBD along with PSC increases the risk of PC threefold.",Salehi AM; Chegini SB; Danaei S; Hasanzarrini M; Shahbazi F,2025,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,56,1,147,10.1007/s12029-025-01266-0,"Salehi, A.

40141145,Gut Microbiota Serves as a Crucial Independent Biomarker in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD unclassified (IBD-U), is a complex intestinal disorder influenced by genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. Recent evidence highlights the gut microbiota as a pivotal biomarker and modulator in IBD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis, characterized by reduced microbial diversity and altered composition, is a hallmark of IBD. A consistent decrease in anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and an increase in pro-inflammatory species, including Escherichia coli, have been observed. Metabolomic studies reveal decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids, critical for gut homeostasis, alongside elevated pro-inflammatory metabolites. The gut microbiota interacts with host immune pathways, influencing morphogens, glycosylation, and podoplanin (PDPN) expression. The disruption of glycosylation impairs mucosal barriers, while aberrant PDPN activity exacerbates inflammation. Additionally, microbial alterations contribute to oxidative stress, further destabilizing intestinal barriers. These molecular and cellular disruptions underscore the role of the microbiome in IBD pathophysiology. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions, aim to restore microbial balance and mitigate inflammation. Advanced studies on microbiota-targeted therapies reveal their potential to reduce disease severity and improve patient outcomes. Nevertheless, further research is needed to elucidate the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiome and host immune responses and to translate these insights into clinical applications.

34944563,Pharmacogenetics of Biological Agents Used in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) comprises a group of disorders, in particular Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), characterized by chronic inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The treatment of these conditions is primarily based on anti-inflammatory drugs, although the use of biological drugs with lower side effects quickly increased in the last decade. However, the presence of certain polymorphisms in the population may determine a different outcome in response to therapy, reflecting the heterogeneity of the efficacy in patients. Considering that several studies showed important correlations between genetic polymorphisms and response to biological treatments in IBD patients, this systematic review aims to summarize the pharmacogenetics of biologicals approved for IBD, thus highlighting a possible association between some polymorphisms and drug response. With this purpose, we reviewed PubMed papers published over the past 21 years (2000-2021), using as the search term ""drug name and IBD or CD or UC and polymorphisms"" to underline the role of pharmacogenetic tests in approaching the disease with a targeted therapy.",Lauro R; Mannino F; Irrera N; Squadrito F; Altavilla D; Squadrito G; Pallio G; Bitto A,2021,Biomedicines,9,12,,10.3390/biomedicines9121748,"Lauro, R., Mannino, F., Irrera, N., Squadrito, F., Altavilla, D., Squadrito, G., Pallio, G., & Bitto, A.

37059601,[Inflammatory bowel diseases: Scoring and pathological reports optimization].,"The two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Both diseases have inflammatory flare-ups that alternate with periods of remission. The pathologist may examine biopsies of the digestive tract from IBD patients in different contexts: at the time of the initial diagnosis, in the event of a disease flare-up in order to differentiate a flare of the disease from another cause, particularly an infectious one, and during the long term follow-up of the disease in order to detect the occurrence of dysplastic lesions. Pathologists are increasingly involved in the evaluation of inflammatory activity during the follow-up of IBD patients. The therapeutic management of IBD has evolved significantly and the emergence of new treatments allows a global approach targeting endoscopic mucosal healing. However, mucosal healing is not always correlated with histological healing. Numerous studies have shown the value of histological evaluation during follow-up. A higher score for histological activity in ulcerative colitis predicts a higher likelihood of neoplasia. Histological activity is a better predictor than endoscopic inflammation of the risk. In UC, histological remission may be a long-term therapeutic goal but its role in CD remains unclear. Different scores have been developed to quantify the inflammatory activity of IBD patients and the response to treatment. The aim of this review is to present the main activity scores used in the follow-up of IBD, their interest, their evaluation and their limitations.",Boulagnon-Rombi C; Marchal A; Lirsac M; Svrcek M,2023,Annales de pathologie,43,3,170-179,10.1016/j.annpat.2023.03.007,"Boulagnon-Rombi, C., Marchal, A., Lirsac, M., & Svrcek, M.

38524131,Long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers of inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses a growing global burden, necessitating the discovery of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. The clinical significance of dysregulated expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in diagnosing IBD has not been well established. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of lncRNAs and circRNAs for IBD based on currently available studies.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out in diverse electronic databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct and Wiley Online Library to retrieve articles published until October 30, 2023. Stata 17.0 software was employed to determine pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). Heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression were explored, and publication bias was assessed using Deeks' funnel plot. Fagan's nomogram and likelihood ratio scattergram were employed to evaluate the clinical validity.
RESULT: A total of 11 articles encompassing 21 studies which involved 1239 IBD patients and 985 healthy controls were investigated. The findings revealed lncRNAs exhibit high level of pooled sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87-0.97) and specificity 0.99 (95% CI: 0.89-1.00), along with PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC values of 64.25 (95% CI: 7.39-558.66), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.03-0.13), 1055.25 (95% CI: 70.61-15770.77), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99), respectively. Conversely, CircRNAs showed moderate accuracy in IBD diagnosis, with sensitivity of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61-0.73), specificity of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65-0.79), PLR of 2.47 (95% CI: 1.94-3.16), NLR of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.38-0.53), DOR of 5.54 (95% CI: 3.88-7.93), and AUC value of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71-0.79). Moreover, findings from subgroup analysis depicted heightened diagnostic efficacy when employing lncRNA H19 and a large sample size (≥100), with notable efficacy in diagnosing both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
CONCLUSION: LncRNAs exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing patients with IBD from healthy controls signifying their possible use as potential biomarkers, while circRNAs showed moderate diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, to validate our findings and confirm the clinical utility of lncRNAs and circRNAs in IBD diagnosis, a large pool of prospective and multi-center studies should be undertaken.

33095281,Giant cell arteritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease: a case-series and review of the literature.,"To describe the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of a series of patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with both GCA and IBD evaluated between 1/1/1996 and 12/30/2018 were retrospectively identified. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, radiologic features, histopathology, management and outcomes were abstracted. A systematic literature review identifying patients with IBD and GCA was performed via a Medline and EMBASE search from inception through December 31 2019. Six patients were identified with GCA and IBD (66% male). Five (83%) had ulcerative colitis (UC) and one had Crohn's disease (CD). Diagnosis of IBD preceded GCA in four patients with an average interval of 30 years (range 14-42). Average time to IBD diagnosis in those with prior GCA diagnosis was 1.5 years. During mean follow-up of 4.3 years, GCA relapse was infrequent with only one patient with relapse observed. Systematic literature review identified six additional patients with confirmed coexistence of GCA and IBD. Similar to the current series, male sex was more common and ulcerative colitis was the predominant IBD phenotype. The current study reports findings from the largest single-institution case-series of co-existent GCA and IBD. In contrast to Takayasu arteritis with co-existent IBD, which displays a predilection for female sex and Crohn's disease phenotype, both the current study and review of literature demonstrate a stronger association of GCA with male sex and ulcerative colitis. Further studies addressing a potential pathophysiologic connection between GCA and IBD are suggested.",Bekele DI; Warrington KJ; Koster MJ,2021,Rheumatology international,41,2,487-492,10.1007/s00296-020-04727-w,"Bekele, D.

37669127,Unveiling the Ghrelin and Obestatin Roles in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Assessing Their Pathogenic Implications and Biomarker Utility.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pathologically known as chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, is among the diseases with a high burden worldwide. Ghrelin and obestatin, as adipocytokines mainly in adipose tissues, are involved in immune responses and inflammatory pathways. Studies have assessed the circulatory ghrelin levels in patients with IBD. Herein, we aim to pool these studies through systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Four international databases, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Web of Science were systematically searched for studies assessing ghrelin or obestatin levels in patients with IBD (either Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]) in active phase or in remission. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to calculate the pooled estimate using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, comprising 1064 patients with IBD (476 UC and 588 CD). A meta-analysis of 11 studies for comparison of active and quiescent disease showed that patients with active IBD had significantly higher levels of ghrelin (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.34; P = .03). However, in separate analyses for UC or CD, no such difference was observed (SMD, 1.30; 95% CI, -0.28 to 2.88, P = .11; and SMD, 0.80; 95% CI, -0.41 to 2.01; P = .20, respectively). No significant difference was also observed in ghrelin levels between patients with active IBD and healthy control subjects. Obestatin levels also were not different between patients with active disease and those in remission (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.68; P = .09). On the other hand, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly lower in patients with active IBD (SMD, -1.90; 95% CI, -2.45 to -1.35; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that IBD patients with active disease have higher levels of ghrelin, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. Also, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio might be a promising biomarker for the assessment of disease activity.",Khalaji A; Babajani N; Amirsardari Z; Saeedian B; Peiman S; Berger NA; Behnoush AH,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,4,629-640,10.1093/ibd/izad202,"Khalaji, A., Babajani, N., Amirsardari, Z., Saeedian, B., Peiman, S., Berger, N.

40217934,The Role of Histology Alongside Clinical and Endoscopic Evaluation in the Management of IBD-A Narrative Review.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions requiring continuous monitoring. Today, endoscopy is the gold standard for assessing disease activity, with histological evaluation providing additional insights. Studies suggest that persistent histological inflammation, despite endoscopic remission, may be associated with a higher risk of relapse in UC, suggesting its role in treatment decisions. In CD, histological assessment is limited by its patchy nature, transmural inflammation and lack of validated scoring systems. Few retrospective studies with conflicting results have examined the prognostic value of histological remission in CD, and its role in predicting long-term outcomes remains unclear. This narrative review aims to summarize and discuss the available evidence regarding the additional value of histological assessment in IBD management. In UC, the ongoing VERDICT study is expected to provide evidence on the impact of incorporating histological remission as a treatment target compared to a strategy based on clinical and endoscopic activity. Recently published interim results indicate that targeting histological remission does not lead to better clinical/biochemical disease activity. Thus, while patients achieving histological healing are associated with better outcomes, the question arises whether achieving histological remission is an intrinsic (biological) characteristic of the patient and indicator of an easier to treat patient group or a result of more effective therapy.",Angyal D; Balogh F; Bessissow T; Wetwittayakhlang P; Ilias A; Gonczi L; Lakatos PL,2025,Journal of clinical medicine,14,7,,10.3390/jcm14072485,"Angyal, D., Balogh, F., Bessissow, T., Wetwittayakhlang, P., Ilias, A., Gonczi, L., & Lakatos, P.

32799561,Evolution of infliximab biosimilar in inflammatory bowel disease: from intravenous to subcutaneous CT-P13.,"INTRODUCTION: Biologic drugs have significantly improved the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). After its patent expired other manufactures developed biosimilar versions, among which CT-P13, and licensed them thorough an expedite process.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13.
EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health-care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.",Parigi TL; D'Amico F; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S,2021,Expert opinion on biological therapy,21,1,37-46,10.1080/14712598.2020.1811849,"Parigi, T.

39498116,Advancements in the use of AI in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes chronic inflammation of the colon and digestive tract, and it can be classified as Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is more prevalent in Europe and North America, however, since the beginning of the 21st century it has been increasing in South America, Asia, and Africa, leading to its consideration as a worldwide problem. Optical colonoscopy is one of the crucial tests in diagnosing and assessing the progression and prognosis of IBD, as it allows a real-time optical visualization of the colonic wall and ileum and allows for the collection of tissue samples. The accuracy of colonoscopy procedures depends on the expertise and ability of the endoscopists. Therefore, algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for colonoscopy images and videos are growing in popularity, especially for the detection and classification of colorectal polyps. The performance of this system is dependent on the quality and quantity of the data used for training. There are several datasets publicly available for endoscopy images and videos, but most of them are solely specialized in polyps. The use of DL algorithms to detect IBD is still in its inception, most studies are based on assessing the severity of UC. As artificial intelligence (AI) grows in popularity there is a growing interest in the use of these algorithms for diagnosing and classifying the IBDs and managing their progression. To tackle this, more annotated colonoscopy images and videos will be required for the training of new and more reliable AI algorithms.

Current research shows that in addition to traditional anti-inflammatory therapy, resolution of inflammation and repair of the epithelial barrier are key biological requirements in combating IBD. Resolution mediators include endogenous lipids that are generated during inflammation, e.g., lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins; and proteins such as Annexin A1 (ANXA1).

We aimed to systematically estimate the causal relationship between IBD and extracolonic cancers.
METHODS: Independent genetic variants strongly associated with IBD were extracted as instrumental variables from genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the International IBD Genetics Consortium including 12,882 IBD patients, 5956 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 6968 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Three sources of cancer GWAS were selected as outcome data. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the causal effects of IBD on 32 extracolonic cancers. The meta-analysis was applied to assess the combined causal effect with multiple MR results.
RESULTS: IBD, CD, and UC have potential causal associations with oral cavity cancer (IBD: OR = 1.180, 95% CI: 1.059 to 1.316, P = 0.003; CD: OR = 1.112, 95% CI: 1.008 to 1.227, P = 0.034; UC: OR = 1.158, 95% CI: 1.041 to 1.288, P = 0.007). Meta-analysis showed a significant positive causal relationship between IBD and breast cancer (OR = 1.059; 95% CI: 1.033 to 1.086; P < 0.0001) as well as a potential causal relationship between CD and breast cancer (OR = 1.029; 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.055; P = 0.032) based on combining multiple MR results.

32440190,Novel Therapeutic Options for People with Ulcerative Colitis: An Update on Recent Developments with Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in human beings, are chronic relapsing-remitting disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, which usually require lifelong therapies. For many years, IBD ﻿have been managed with corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants (ie, thiopurines). The advent of biologic therapies (anti-TNF-α agents) has significantly improved the outcome of IBD patients in terms of prolonged clinical remission, corticosteroid sparing, achievement of mucosal healing and prevention of disease-related complications. Nevertheless, primary failure or loss of response to biologics occur in about 50% of patients treated with these drugs. Therefore, the need for new effective treatments for such patients has critically emerged as an urgent priority. With this regard, several small-molecule drugs (SMDs) targeting lymphocyte trafficking (ie, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators) and the JAK/STAT pathway (eg, tofacitinib) have been recently developed and tested in IBD. In particular, JAK inhibitors are oral compounds characterized by short half-life, low antigenicity and the ability to dampen several pro-inflammatory pathways simultaneously. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, has shown good efficacy and safety in UC clinical trials and has been recently approved for the treatment of UC patients. In this review, we analyze the main evidence supporting the use of JAK inhibitors in UC and explore the unanswered questions about the use of this class of drug in UC.",Troncone E; Marafini I; Del Vecchio Blanco G; Di Grazia A; Monteleone G,2020,Clinical and experimental gastroenterology,13,,131-139,10.2147/CEG.S208020,"Troncone, E., Marafini, I., Del Vecchio Blanco, G., Di Grazia, A., & Monteleone, G.

32570252,"Emerging Treatment Options in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Janus Kinases, Stem Cells, and More.","BACKGROUND: Treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has tremendously improved during the last 20 years; however, a substantial fraction of patients does not respond to available therapies or lose response, and new strategies are needed.
SUMMARY: Two pharmacological principles have been successfully used for IBD treatment: inhibition of cellular signaling and interference with leukocyte trafficking. Besides tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-23 is a promising drug target, and antibodies for the combined inhibition of IL-23 and IL-12 (ustekinumab and briakinumab) or selective IL-23 inhibition (brazikumab, risankizumab, and mirikizumab) seem to be effective in Crohn's disease (CD) with emerging evidence also for ulcerative colitis (UC). Janus kinase (JAK) mediates intracellular signaling of a large number of cytokines. Tofacitinib is the first JAK inhibitor approved for UC, and the JAK inhibitors filgotinib and upadacitinib showed potential in CD. Leukocyte trafficking can be inhibited by interference with lymphocyte integrin-α4β7 or endothelial MadCAM-1. The α4β7 integrin inhibitor vedolizumab is an established treatment in IBD, and long-term data of pivotal studies are now available. Additional molecules with therapeutic potential are α4β7-specific abrilumab, β7-specific etrolizumab, and the α4-specific small molecule AJM300. PF-00547659, an antibody against endothelial MadCAM-1, also showed therapeutic potential in UC. Modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) activity is necessary for the egress of lymphocytes into the circulation, and S1PR modulation results in lymphocyte trapping in lymphatic organs. Ozanimod, an S1PR1 and S1PR5 inhibitor, has been successfully tested in initial studies in UC. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has been approved for the treatment of complex, active CD fistula, and mesenchymal stem cell therapy might be a paradigm shift for this condition. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been successfully used in CD case series; however, in a randomized trial, a highly stringent endpoint was not met. However, considering positive effects in secondary endpoints, ASCT might be a future treatment of last resort in severe, refractory CD cases, provided that safer protocols can be provided. Key messages: New IBD treatments are successful for a significant fraction of patients. However, new strategies for patient selection, treatment combinations, and/or additional therapies must be developed to serve the need of all IBD patients.",Misselwitz B; Juillerat P; Sulz MC; Siegmund B; Brand S,2020,Digestion,101 Suppl 1,,69-82,10.1159/000507782,"Misselwitz, B., Juillerat, P., Sulz, M.

39921836,Insights into adverse events and safety profile of upadacitinib in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases - A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with upadacitinib and examined secondary adverse events.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing upadacitinib with placebo in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The primary outcome was the incidence of SAEs, while secondary outcomes included specific adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: Six RCTs, including 2611 patients, were analyzed. The incidence of SAEs did not significantly differ between upadacitinib (6.1%) and placebo (7%) (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.50-1.20; p = 0.25). Secondary outcomes showed no significant differences in serious infections, hepatic disorders, nasopharyngitis or herpes zoster. However, neutropenia (RR = 5.63; 95% CI: 1.90-16.65; p = 0.0002) and creatine kinase elevation (RR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.22-4.47; p = 0.01) were higher with upadacitinib, while anemia (RR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.27-0.48; p < 0.00001) and arthralgia (RR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.30-0.75; p = 0.001) were reduced.
CONCLUSION: Upadacitinib did not increase the overall risk of SAEs in IBD patients, with a notable reduction in anemia and arthralgia. However, the higher risks of neutropenia and CK elevation underscore the importance of monitoring. Further research is necessary to assess long-term safety, particularly regarding rare but serious events such as thromboembolism.",Falcon BTQ; de Mello Guimaraes T; Halpern GA; Gomes C; de Mello Guimaraes T,2025,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,44,2,154-162,10.1007/s12664-024-01720-0,"Falcon, B.

34368180,Innovative Diagnostic Endoscopy in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: From High-Definition to Molecular Endoscopy.,"High-definition endoscopy is one essential step in the initial diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterizing the extent and severity of inflammation, as well as discriminating ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn's disease (CD). Following general recommendations and national guidelines, individual risk stratification should define the appropriate surveillance strategy, biopsy protocol and frequency of endoscopies. Beside high-definition videoendoscopy the application of dyes applied via a spraying catheter is of additional diagnostic value with a higher detection rate of intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN). Virtual chromoendoscopy techniques (NBI, FICE, I-scan, BLI) should not be recommended as a single surveillance strategy in IBD, although newer data suggest a higher comparability to dye-based chromoendoscopy than previously assumed. First results of oral methylene blue formulation are promising for improving the acceptance rate of classical chromoendoscopy. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is still an experimental but highly innovative endoscopic procedure with the potential to contribute to the detection of dysplastic lesions. Molecular endoscopy in IBD has taken application of CLE to a higher level and allows topical application of labeled probes, mainly antibodies, against specific target structures expressed in the tissue to predict response or failure to biological therapies. First pre-clinical and in vivo data from label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM) are now available to characterize mucosal and submucosal inflammation on endoscopy in more detail. These new techniques now have opened the door to individualized and highly specific molecular imaging in IBD in the future and pave the path to personalized medicine approaches.

37763180,A Multifaced Aspect of Clostridium difficile Infection in Pediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Case Series and Literature Review.,"Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), with a rising incidence over time. Differentiating between CDI and IBD exacerbation is challenging due to overlapping symptoms. In our cohort of 55 pediatric IBD patients, 6 were diagnosed with CDI. Upon conducting a thorough patient evaluation and subsequent data analysis, an exhaustive review of the existing literature was undertaken. CDI is more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) than Crohn's disease (CD) patients, as seen in our patients and in the existing literature. The management of a pediatric patient with IBD is itself a challenge for a clinician because of the chronic, possibly relapsing course, and substantial long-term morbidity. When CDI is added, it becomes even more demanding, since CDI leads to more severe disease in children with IBD. A multidisciplinary approach and intensive treatment for possible sepsis, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hydro-electrolytic and acid-base imbalances are frequently mandatory in patients with CDI and IBD, which leads to a significant health care burden in hospitalized children with IBD. After the infection is treated with antibiotic therapy, important considerations regarding the future treatment for the underlying IBD are also necessary; in most cases, a treatment escalation is required, as also seen in our study group.",Iana E; Boboc C; Vlad AG; Cosoreanu MT; Anghel M; Boboc AA; Ioan A; Ionescu MI; Gavriliu L; Galos F,2023,Journal of personalized medicine,13,9,,10.3390/jpm13091413,"Iana, E., Boboc, C., Vlad, A.

The following EIMs can be classified as IBD-associated: mucocutaneous, ocular, pulmonary, renal, genitourinary, hematological, neurological, psychiatric, cardiac and hepatobiliary. The latter include primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cholelithiasis, IgG4 associated cholangiopathy (IAC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis B and C, and drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

36112307,Role of interleukin-6-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease: focus on the available therapeutic approaches and gut microbiome.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is considered a chronic inflammatory and multifactorial disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two types of chronic IBD. Although there is no accurate information about IBD pathophysiology, evidence suggests that various factors, including the gut microbiome, environment, genetics, lifestyle, and a dysregulated immune system, may increase susceptibility to IBD. Moreover, inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in the immunopathogenesis of IBDs. IL-6 contributes to T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation, mediating further destructive inflammatory responses in CD and UC. Moreover, Th1-mediated responses participate in IBD, and the antiapoptotic IL-6/IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signals are responsible for preserving Th1 cells in the site of inflammation. It has been revealed that fecal bacteria isolated from UC-active and UC-remission patients stimulate the hyperproduction of several cytokines, such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-10, and IL-12. Given the importance of the IL-6/IL-6R axis, various therapeutic options exist for controlling or treating IBD. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches such as modulating the gut microbiome could be beneficial due to the failure of the target therapies so far. This review article summarizes IBD immunopathogenesis focusing on the IL-6/IL-6R axis and discusses available therapeutic approaches based on the gut microbiome alteration and IL-6/IL-6R axis targeting and treatment failure.",Shahini A; Shahini A,2023,Journal of cell communication and signaling,17,1,55-74,10.1007/s12079-022-00695-x,"Shahini, A., & Shahini, A.

40027008,Mesalazine-Induced Myocarditis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This chronic, immune-mediated disorder leads to inflammation in specific gastrointestinal tract regions. Myocarditis is a rare but significant IBD complication that affects roughly 0.3% of cases. Mesalazine-induced myocarditis is a rare side effect of mesalazine therapy, which is considered a standard treatment for IBD. Increased mortality and cardiogenic shock are possible outcomes of this adverse response. The objectives of this study are to characterize the clinical features of mesalazine-induced myocarditis in patients with IBD, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of mesalazine-related myocarditis cases in IBD patients, to review the existing literature, to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of myocarditis in IBD, and to determine whether myocarditis represents an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD or an adverse drug reaction to mesalazine. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Relevant literature was retrieved from Cochrane, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, and PubMed Central (PMC). Only articles published in English or with a full English translation available within the last 10 years (2014-2024) were included. A rigorous quality assessment tool was applied to ensure the quality of evidence-based medicine that will be utilized to construct a conclusion and direct future reviews. Among 43 patients analyzed, 29 (67%) developed myocarditis attributable to mesalazine treatment, while 14 (33%) exhibited myocarditis unrelated to the medication. Our findings indicate that myocarditis in IBD is more likely to be a severe drug reaction than an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD progression. In drug-induced myocarditis cases, mesalazine derivatives, including sulfasalazine, mesalamine, and balsalazide, were most frequently implicated. Potential mechanisms underlying mesalazine-associated myocarditis include IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, direct cardiotoxicity, cell-mediated hypersensitivity, or humoral antibody responses to drug metabolites. When treating myocarditis in IBD, whether due to medication or as an extraintestinal manifestation, discontinuing the offending drug and initiating immunosuppressive therapy appear to be the most effective approach.",Jhakri K; Al-Shudifat M; Sumra B; Kocherry C; Shamim H; Mohammed L,2025,Cureus,17,1,e78208,10.7759/cureus.78208,"Jhakri, K., Al-Shudifat, M., Sumra, B., Kocherry, C., Shamim, H., & Mohammed, L.

39521604,TL1A: A model for a precision medicine approach in the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a collective term for chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. The term IBD encompasses two main forms, Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). CD is characterized by inflammation throughout the length of the gut, especially the ileum and colon, and is often complicated with fistulae and/or intestinal strictures. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is inflammatory disease restricted to the colon and rectum. In practice however, IBD is a heterogenous disease with CD and UC representing the extremes of a continuum of diseases with varied clinical presentation, including disease location, severity, and manifestation of extraintestinal diseases. This disease heterogeneity poses a challenge to successful and efficacious therapeutic treatment as the etiology driving disease in individual patients is unknown and likely to be multifactorial, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors such as the microbiota, as well as social behaviors such as smoking and diet. Precision medicine provides a strategy to account for disease heterogeneity and diverse etiology to select for patients most likely to respond to a given therapeutic. In this chapter we present an example of the development of a novel antibody therapeutic, Tulisokibart, as a model for a Precision Medicine approach to the successful treatment of patients with IBD.",Bilsborough JM; Targan SR,2024,"Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",101,,287-299,10.1016/bs.apha.2024.10.014,"Bilsborough, J.

33394309,IL-1 and CD40/CD40L platelet complex: elements of induction of Crohn's disease and new therapeutic targets.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic and multifactorial diseases that affect the intestinal tract, both characterized by recurrent inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, resulting in abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and, rectal bleeding. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) regroup these two disorders. The exact pathological mechanism of IBD remains ambiguous and poorly known. In genetically predisposed patients, defects in intestinal mucosal barrier are due to an uncontrolled inflammatory response to normal flora. In addition to the genetic predisposition, these defects could be triggered by environmental factors or by a specific lifestyle which is widely accepted as etiological hypothesis. The involvement of the CD40/CD40L platelet complex in the development of IBD has been overwhelmingly demonstrated. CD40L is climacteric in cell signalling in innate and adaptive immunity, the CD40L expression on the platelet cell surface gives them an immunological competence. The IL-1, a major inflammation mediator could be involved in different ways in the development of IBD. Here, we provide a comprehensive review regarding the role of platelet CD40/CD40L in the pathophysiological effect of IL-1 in the development of Crohn's disease (CD).

We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the association between genetically predicted IBD and CHD risk.
METHODS: Exposure summary data were obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with cohorts of IBD (12,882 cases and 21,770 controls), UC (6968 cases and 20,464 controls), and CD (5956 cases and 14,927 controls) of European descent to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables. Outcome summary data were obtained from a meta-analysis of 22 GWAS including 22,233 cases and 64,762 controls of European descent. To estimate MR, four methods were used, including inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted median methods. Sensitivity analysis was also performed. The Bonferroni method was used to correct the bias of multiple testing.
RESULTS: Three sets of SNPs (69 SNPs of IBD, 40 SNPs of UC, and 58 SNPs of CD) were used to estimate the causal effect between genetically predicted IBD and CHD. Using the IVW method, we found that no causal relationship between genetically predicted IBD and CHD after Bonferroni correction, and there was no causal relationship between UC/CD and the development of CHD. No evidence of significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy was found.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that genetically predicted IBD may have no causal effect on CHD risk in a population with European ancestry.",Qiu X; Hou C; Yang Z; Wang Q; Li L,2022,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,134,21-22,779-787,10.1007/s00508-022-02095-y,"Qiu, X., Hou, C., Yang, Z., Wang, Q., & Li, L.

37519622,"Advancements in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Narrative Review of Diagnostics, Management, Epidemiology, Prevalence, Patient Outcomes, Quality of Life, and Clinical Presentation.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder that impacts the gastrointestinal tract. Significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD have been made during the past few decades, improving patient outcomes. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD. Both from an evaluative and therapeutic standpoint, the management of IBD has undergone significant change. The standard of treatment for treating UC and CD patients has changed due to several medical developments. These developments include amino-salicylates, immunosuppressants, biological agents, and new therapeutics. The review also addresses the difficulties in applying these developments in clinical practice. Globally, the prevalence of IBD is rising, with Asia among the regions with the highest rates. These environments provide particular difficulties, such as poor disease knowledge, a lack of diagnostic services, and infectious IBD mimics. These issues must be resolved to diagnose and manage IBD in these populations accurately. New imaging modalities and other improvements in diagnostic methods have increased the precision and early identification of IBD. To reduce problems and improve patient outcomes, healthcare professionals treating patients with IBD must work effectively as a team. An extensive summary of current developments in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD is given in this narrative review. It draws attention to the therapeutic possibilities, difficulties, and uncertainties of integrating these developments into clinical practice.

38073917,The Role of Serological Markers in the Prediction of Disease Course and Response to Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common gastrointestinal tract disease and can be divided into two major groups: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These two entities can be diagnosed from a combination of invasive and non-invasive tests as well as a thorough history and physical examination. However, invasive tests are preferred for a definitive diagnosis since the two entities have characteristic features of colonoscopy and biopsy. In this review, the following will be discussed: how non-invasive tests could help detect the presence of IBD, how markers help monitor disease progression, and how the disease responds to treatment. Some of the common markers that are discussed in detail include perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (p-ANCA), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), calprotectin, lactoferrin, lipocalin-2 (LCN2), and several other novel markers that are based on bacterial antigens. The best non-invasive tests available for detecting the presence of IBD are serological and fecal markers. Detecting these markers has helped doctors significantly by bringing to their attention the possibility of the presence of IBD. The serological testing can also help distinguish the two forms of IBD since a different combination of markers is elevated in UC and CD. In addition, the symptoms of IBD are non-specific and usually overlap with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, so by finding these serological markers, doctors can proceed with further invasive testing that would give them a definitive diagnosis. That way, invasive testing, such as colonoscopy with biopsy, can be avoided in patients with no suspicion of IBD. The common markers used in the clinical setting to point out the presence of IBD are discussed in detail in this review. Recently, more specific markers derived from bacterial antigens are also used, and their role is discussed, too.",Reghefaoui M; Peresuodei TS; Saavedra Palacios MS; Gill A; Orji C; Reghefaoui T; Mostafa J,2023,Cureus,15,11,e48442,10.7759/cureus.48442,"Reghefaoui, M., Peresuodei, T.

40650240,Nanomedicine Strategies in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer.,"The gut microbiota has emerged as a key area of biomedical research due to its integral role in maintaining host health and its involvement in the pathogenesis of many systemic diseases. Growing evidence supports the notion that gut dysbiosis contributes significantly to diseases and their progression. An example would be inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group of conditions that cause inflammation and swelling of the digestive tract, with the principal types being ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Another notable disease with significant association to gut dysbiosis would be colorectal cancer (CRC), a malignancy which typically begins as polyps in the colon or rectum, but has the potential to metastasise to other parts of the body, including the liver and lungs, among others. Concurrently, advances in nanomedicine, an evolving field that applies nanotechnology for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, have opened new avenues for targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies.

33392214,Global Studies of Using Fecal Biomarkers in Predicting Relapse in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract mainly comprising two forms including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is a lifelong relapsing remitting disease and relapses occur at random patterns which are unpredictable. Fecal biomarkers have been increasingly used to assess disease activity in IBD due to their positive correlations with intestinal inflammation. Recent studies have also assessed the use of fecal biomarkers in predicting relapse and post-operative recurrence. This review provides information from global studies of using fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin and S100A12 to predict relapse in IBD. Strategies for further studies and the use of these fecal biomarkers for personalized management in IBD are also discussed.",Liu F; Lee SA; Riordan SM; Zhang L; Zhu L,2020,Frontiers in medicine,7,,580803,10.3389/fmed.2020.580803,"Liu, F., Lee, S.

38106709,Therapeutic Granulomonocytapheresis as a Non-pharmacologic Treatment Option for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Efficacy Reports on a Wide Age Range and Disease Profile.,"The major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which cause debilitating symptoms, including bloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and fever. Patients require life-long immunosuppressive medications, which cause adverse side effects as additional morbidity factors. However, IBD is initiated and perpetuated by inflammatory cytokines, and given that in patients with IBD myeloid lineage leukocytes are elevated with activation behavior and release inflammatory cytokines, selective depletion of elevated granulocytes and monocytes by granulomonocytapheresis is a relevant therapeutic option for IBD patients. Therefore, a column filled with specially designed beads as granulomonocytapheresis carriers for selective adsorption of myeloid lineage leukocytes (Adacolumn) has been applied to treat patients with active IBD. Patients receive up to 10 granulomonocytapheresis sessions at one or two sessions per week. During each session, the carriers adsorb up to 60% of the myeloid leukocytes from the blood that passes through the granulomonocytapheresis column. Efficacy rates in the UC setting have been as high as 85% in steroid-naïve patients, and 100% in drug-naïve, first-episode cases, but patients with a long duration of active IBD and extensive colonic lesions that have become refractory to pharmacological treatment have not responded well. However, granulomonocytapheresis has a favorable safety profile. Given that immunosuppressive medications used to treat IBD potentially may increase the risk of severe viral infection, non-drug granulomonocytapheresis should be a favorable treatment strategy. Further, by targeting granulomonocytapheresis to patients with background features and identifying a patient as a likely responder, futile use of medical resources is avoided.",Tanaka T,2023,Cureus,15,11,e48913,10.7759/cureus.48913,"Tanaka, T.

To clarify the relationship between IL-12B gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to CD and UC, a meta-analysis was conducted.Methods: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane databases was conducted up to Oct 2019. Studies evaluating the relationship between risk of IBD and variants of IL-12B (rs6887695, rs3212227 and rs10045431) were included. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was implemented to estimate the required information size (RIS) and evaluate the credibility of the meta-analysis results.Results: Seventeen studies containing 9827 patients with CD, 7583 patients with UC and 16044 controls were included. The results showed significant association between rs6887695 polymorphism and susceptibility to CD (allele model: OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.12-1.22) and UC (allele model: OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09-1.23), and ""C"" allele carriers had a higher risk, with TSA conclusive. For rs10045431, no significant association with CD susceptibility was identified, while a significantly increased risk in UC was found (allele mode: OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.25), both results were conclusive according to TSA. No significant association between rs3212227 and CD or UC susceptibility was found, and TSA research warranted further investigation to certify the results. No significant heterogeneity was found.Conclusion: IL-12B rs6887695 polymorphism was associated with increased risk of CD and UC, while IL-12B rs10045431 polymorphism might only be correlated with the risk of UC.Abbreviations: IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; CD: Crohn's disease; UC: ulcerative colitis; IL-12B: interleukin-12B; OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence interval; TSA: trial sequential analysis; RIS: required information size; DCs: dendritic cells; NK: nature killer; APCs: antigen-presenting cells; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphisms; HWE: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; NOS: Newcastle-Ottawa scale; RRR: relative risk reduction.",Wang J; Liu H; Wang Y; Wu J; Wang C; Liu K; Qin Q,2021,Immunological investigations,50,8,987-1006,10.1080/08820139.2020.1863981,"Wang, J., Liu, H., Wang, Y., Wu, J., Wang, C., Liu, K., & Qin, Q.

35207211,Histological Scores in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: The State of the Art.,"The histological assessment has been advocated as a detailed and accurate measure of disease activity in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In ulcerative colitis (UC), histological activity has been demonstrated to be associated with higher rates of relapse, prolonged corticosteroid use and long-term complications, even when endoscopic remission is achieved. Therefore, histological healing may represent a potential treatment target. Several histological scores have been developed and are available today. The Robarts histopathology index (RHI) and the Nancy index (NI) are the only two recommended by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) for use in patients with UC. Conversely, in Crohn's disease (CD), the discontinuous nature of lesions has limited standardized histological assessment. Most of the available histological scoring systems in CD are complex and not validated. The aim of this review is to comprehensively summarize the latest evidence regarding histological scoring systems in IBD. We guide the reader through understanding the importance of an accurate microscopic evaluation using validated scoring systems, highlighting the strengths and pitfalls of each score.

34017333,Targeting Immune Cell Trafficking - Insights From Research Models and Implications for Future IBD Therapy.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are multifactorial diseases with still unknown aetiology and an increasing prevalence and incidence worldwide. Despite plentiful therapeutic options for IBDs, the lack or loss of response in certain patients demands the development of further treatments to tackle this unmet medical need. In recent years, the success of the anti-α4β7 antibody vedolizumab highlighted the potential of targeting the homing of immune cells, which is now an important pillar of IBD therapy. Due to its complexity, leukocyte trafficking and the involved molecules offer a largely untapped resource for a plethora of potential therapeutic interventions. In this review, we aim to summarise current and future directions of specifically interfering with immune cell trafficking. We will comment on concepts of homing, retention and recirculation and particularly focus on the role of tissue-derived chemokines. Moreover, we will give an overview of the mode of action of drugs currently in use or still in the pipeline, highlighting their mechanisms and potential to reduce disease burden.",Wiendl M; Becker E; Müller TM; Voskens CJ; Neurath MF; Zundler S,2021,Frontiers in immunology,12,,656452,10.3389/fimmu.2021.656452,"Wiendl, M., Becker, E., Müller, T.

36219564,Most Placebo-Controlled Trials in Inflammatory Bowel Disease were Underpowered Because of Overestimated Drug Efficacy Rates: Results from a Systematic Review of Induction Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most pharmaceutical clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are placebo-controlled and require effect size estimation for a drug relative to placebo. We compared expected effect sizes in sample size calculations [SSCs] to actual effect sizes in IBD clinical trials.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane library were searched from inception to March 26, 2021, to identify placebo-controlled induction studies for luminal Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] that reported an SSC and a primary endpoint of clinical remission/response. Expected effects were subtracted from actual effects, and interquartile ranges [IQRs] for each corresponding median difference were calculated. Linear regression was used to assess whether placebo or drug event rate misspecifications were responsible for these differences.
RESULTS: Of eligible studies, 36.9% [55/149] were excluded because of incomplete SSC reporting, yielding 94 studies [46 CD, 48 UC]. Treatment effects were overestimated in CD for remission (-12.6% [IQR: -16.3 to -1.6%]), in UC for remission (-10.2% [IQR: -16.5 to -5.6%]) and in CD for response (-15.3% [IQR: -27.1 to -5.8%]). Differences observed were due to overestimated drug event rates, whereas expected and actual placebo event rates were similar. A meta-regression demonstrated associations between overestimated treatment effect sizes and several trial characteristics: isolated ileal disease, longer CD duration, extensive colitis [UC], single-centre, phase 2 and no endoscopic endpoint component [UC].
CONCLUSION: Overestimation of IBD therapy efficacy rates resulted in smaller-than-expected treatment effects. These results should be used to inform SSCs and trial design for IBD drug development.",Bahnam P; Hanzel J; Ma C; Zou L; Narula N; Singh S; Kahan B; Jairath V,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,3,404-417,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac150,"Bahnam, P., Hanzel, J., Ma, C., Zou, L., Narula, N., Singh, S., Kahan, B., & Jairath, V.

35224015,5-Aminosalicylic Acid Chemoprevention in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Is It Necessary in the Age of Biologics and Small Molecules?,"BACKGROUND: Due to the increased incidence of colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), the value of chemoprevention for this patient group has been repeatedly debated in the past decade. This review describes available evidence and the current recommendations for chemoprevention in national and international guidelines IBD guidelines.
SUMMARY: 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds are the preferred therapeutic option for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). Aside from the known anti-inflammatory effects, their chemopreventive abilities have been described in vitro and in vivo. Pooling the increasing number of retrospective and population-based clinical studies over the last 15 years, 7 consecutive meta-analyses revealed partially conflicting results for the chemopreventive efficacy of 5-ASA, and thus, not all IBD guidelines currently recommend chemoprevention with mesalamine compounds. Accumulating evidence for decreasing the colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in support of thiopurines more recently shows a protective effect. This effect seems solely mediated by control of intestinal inflammation since, for this drug class, another mechanistic interference in IBD-associated CRC pathogenesis is not known. The results regarding chemopreventive efficacy for ursodeoxycholic acid or folic acid are equivocal, and the use of these medications to prevent CRC is not firmly established. Like UC, the risk of CRC is also significantly increased in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), especially Crohn's colitis. However, no published studies exclusively assess the effects of surveillance on the early detection of cancer or CRC chemoprevention in CD patients. In meta-analyses, which predominantly included UC patients, 5-ASA or thiopurines were not beneficial in small CD subgroups. The level of evidence for anti-TNFα agents, anti-integrin (e.g., vedolizumab), or anti-IL-12/IL-23 agents (e.g., ustekinumab) and Janus kinase inhibitors is currently too low or nonexistent to use them solely for chemoprevention in UC or CD patients.
KEY MESSAGE: Intestinal inflammation is one of the main risk factors for developing CRC in IBD, and all drugs that induce and maintain mucosal healing most likely also decrease the IBD-associated CRC risk. Thus, a therapeutic strategy of adding a 5-ASA therapy to a successfully mucosal healing-inducing therapy, for example, with a biologic or a small molecule merely to prevent CRC appears to be obsolete.",Herfarth H; Vavricka SR,2022,Inflammatory intestinal diseases,7,1,28-35,10.1159/000518865,"Herfarth, H., & Vavricka, S.

33287220,Therapeutic Effect of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Ulcerative Colitis: A Review on Achievements and Challenges.,"The worldwide epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), still shows an increasing trend in Asia and Iran. Despite an improvement in the treatment landscape focused on symptomatic control, long-term colectomies have not decreased over the last 10-year period. Thus, novel therapies are urgently needed in clinics to supplement the existing treatments. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells with immunosuppressive effects, targeting IBD as a new treatment strategy. They have recently received global attention for their use in cell transplantation due to their easy expansion and wide range of activities to be engrafted, and because they are home to the mucosa of the intestine. Moreover, MSCs are able to differentiate into epithelial and other cells that can directly promote repair in the mucosal damages in UC. It seems that there is a need to deepen our understanding to target MSCs as a promising treatment option for UC patients who are refractory to conventional therapies. Here, we overviewed the therapeutic effects of MSCs in UC and discussed the achievements and challenges in the cell transplantation of UC.",Hosseini-Asl SK; Mehrabani D; Karimi-Busheri F,2020,Journal of clinical medicine,9,12,,10.3390/jcm9123922,"Hosseini-Asl, S.

Therefore, the authors conducted a meta-analysis to robustly explore relationships between polymorphisms in pro-inflammatory cytokines and the risk of IBD by integrating the results of previous works. Medline, Embase, Wanfang, VIP and CNKI were searched throughly for eligible studies, and 35 genetic association studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. We noticed that genotypic frequencies of IL-1B rs1143627, IL-6 rs1800795 and IL-8 rs4073 polymorphisms among cases with IBD and population-based controls differed significantly. Moreover, we found that genotypic frequencies of IL-1B rs1143627 and IL-6 rs1800795 polymorphisms among cases with IBD and population-based controls of Caucasian origin differed significantly, whereas genotypic frequency of IL-8 rs4073 and IL-18 rs187238 polymorphisms among cases with IBD and population-based controls of Asian origin also differed significantly. Furthermore, we also noticed that genotypic frequency of IL-18 rs187238 polymorphism among cases with Crohn's disease (CD) and population-based controls differed significantly. In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated that IL-1B rs1143627 and IL-6 rs1800795 polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of IBD in overall population and Caucasians. Moreover, IL-8 rs4073 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of IBD in overall population and Asians.

38716206,"Racial and ethnic disparities in clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition that has been increasing in prevalence and incidence worldwide. Although, most cases are described in Caucasian populations, there has been a rise in IBD diagnosis among other populations. In this article, we will discuss the disparities in the presentation, management, medical and surgical outcomes of IBD patients among different racial and ethnic groups.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. The search strategy included targeted keywords to identify specific studies that provided the current literature on disparities in IBD presentation and management. Articles for presentation were selected by the authors, in accordance with a narrative review format, favoring population-based studies, systematic reviews and meta-analysis over single or multicenter reports.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Epidemiological data has shown that there is an increasing incidence in IBD diagnosis among Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations over the past decade. Differences in genetic predispositions have been observed, however it is difficult to ascertain if the minor differences in presentation and medical/surgical management reported are due to innate differences or due to confounding factors such as access to health care.

38257292,Short Chain Fatty Acids: Essential Weapons of Traditional Medicine in Treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent intestinal inflammatory disease, mainly including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In recent years, the incidence and prevalence of IBD have been on the rise worldwide and have become a significant concern of health and a huge economic burden on patients. The occurrence and development of IBD involve a variety of pathogenic factors. The changes in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are considered to be an important pathogenic mechanism of this disease. SCFAs are important metabolites in the intestinal microbial environment, which are closely involved in regulating immune, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activities. Changes in metabolite levels can reflect the homeostasis of the intestinal microflora. Recent studies have shown that SCFAs provide energy for host cells and intestinal microflora, shape the intestinal environment, and regulate the immune system, thereby regulating intestinal physiology. SCFAs can effectively reduce the incidence of enteritis, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, obesity, and diabetes, and also play an important role in maintaining the balance of energy metabolism (mainly glucose metabolism) and improving insulin tolerance. In recent years, many studies have shown that numerous decoctions and natural compounds of traditional Chinese medicine have shown promising therapeutic activities in multiple animal models of colitis and thus attracted increasing attention from scientists in the study of IBD treatment. Some of these traditional Chinese medicines or compounds can effectively alleviate colonic inflammation and clinical symptoms by regulating the generation of SCFAs. This study reviews the effects of various traditional Chinese medicines or bioactive substances on the production of SCFAs and their potential impacts on the severity of colonic inflammation. On this basis, we discussed the mechanism of SCFAs in regulating IBD-associated inflammation, as well as the related regulatory factors and signaling pathways. In addition, we provide our understanding of the limitations of current research and the prospects for future studies on the development of new IBD therapies by targeting SCFAs. This review may widen our understanding of the effect of traditional medicine from the view of SCFAs and their role in alleviating IBD animal models, thus contributing to the studies of IBD researchers.",Yao Y; Liu Y; Xu Q; Mao L,2024,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",29,2,,10.3390/molecules29020379,"Yao, Y., Liu, Y., Xu, Q., & Mao, L.

33433655,"Inflammatory bowel disease and risk of gastric, small bowel and colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of 26 observational studies.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the associations between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and risk of the gastric, small bowel and colorectal cancer.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science for observational studies published before June 2020, and the quality of each included study was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies comprising 531 449 IBD patients and more than 65 million reference individuals were included. Although IBD was significantly associated with 67% increased risk of the total gastric, small bowel and colorectal cancer. After stratifying by cancer location, IBD mainly increased the risk of intestinal cancer instead of gastric cancer. Furthermore, Crohn's disease (CD) significantly increased the risk of both small bowel cancer and colorectal cancer, while ulcerative colitis (UC) only increased the risk of colorectal cancer. In subgroup analysis, associations between IBD and risk of total gastric, small bowel and colorectal cancer were similar between male and female, except for that male IBD patients but not female had a significantly higher risk of small bowel cancer. Additionally, IBD patients in different geographical areas had different associations with risk of various gastrointestinal tract cancers.

Nutrition, as an important factor influencing the occurrence and development of IBD, has attracted more and more attention. As the most important nutrient, protein can not only provide energy and nutrition required by patients, but also help repair damaged intestinal tissue, enhance immunity, and thus alleviate inflammation. Numerous studies have shown that protein nutritional support plays a significant role in the treatment and remission of IBD. This article presents a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of IBD and analyzes and summarizes the potential mechanisms of protein nutritional support in IBD. Additionally, it provides an overview of the clinical effects of protein nutritional support in IBD and its impact on clinical complications. Research findings reveal that protein nutritional support demonstrates significant benefits in improving clinical symptoms, reducing the risk of complications, and improving quality of life in IBD patients.

34110607,Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Cannabis: A Practical Approach for Clinicians.,"Although still not approved at the federal level for medical or adult recreational use, cannabis has been approved in the United States (USA) by individual states for both of these purposes. A total of 15 states now regulate cannabis for adult use and 36 states for medical use. In more recent years, cannabis has gained popularity for the treatment of chronic conditions, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) being one of them. However, the exact role of cannabis in the treatment of IBD remains uncertain. While cannabis may help in some instances with symptom management, it has not been proven to help with inflammation or to fundamentally correct underlying disease processes. Additionally, along with the perceived symptom benefits of cannabis come concerning issues like dosing inconsistencies, dependence, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. In this review article, we explore the nuanced relationship between cannabis and the treatment of IBD by summarizing the current research. We also use clinical vignettes to discuss the more practical considerations surrounding its use.",Buckley MC; Kumar A; Swaminath A,2021,Advances in therapy,38,7,4152-4161,10.1007/s12325-021-01805-8,"Buckley, M.

37859409,Application of Drug Repurposing Approach for Therapeutic Intervention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) characterized by chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation, abdominal pain, cramping, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhoea, and weight loss. Although the etiology of IBD remains unclear, it is believed to be an interaction between genes, and environmental factors, such as an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, changing food habits, an ultra-hygiene environment, and an inappropriate immune system. The development of novel effective therapies is stymied by a lack of understanding of the aetiology of IBD. The current therapy involves the use of aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids that can effectively manage symptoms, induce and sustain remission, prevent complications, modify the course of the disease, provide diverse treatment options, showcase advancements in biologic therapies, and enhance the overall quality of life. However, the efficacy of current therapy is overshadowed by a plethora of adverse effects, such as loss of weight, mood swings, skin issues, loss of bone density, higher vulnerability to infections, and elevated blood pressure. Biologicals, like anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, can stimulate an autoimmune response in certain individuals that may diminish the effectiveness of the medication over time, necessitating a switch to alternative treatments. The response of IBD patients to current drug therapy is quite varied, which can lead to disease flares that underlines the urgent need to explore alternative treatment option to address the unmet need of developing new treatment strategies for IBD with high efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Drug repurposing is a novel strategy where existing drugs that have already been validated safe in patients for the management of certain diseases are redeployed to treat other, unindicated diseases. The present narrative review focuses on potential drug candidates that could be repurposed for the management of IBD using on-target and off-target strategies. It covers their preclinical, clinical assessment, mechanism of action, and safety profiles, and forecasts their appropriateness in the management of IBD. The review presents useful insights into the most promising candidates for repurposing, like anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic troxerutin, which has been found to improve the DSS-induced colitis in rats, an antiosteoarthritic drug diacetylrhein that has been found to have remarkable ameliorating effects on DSS-induced colitis via anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory properties and by influencing both apoptosis and pyroptosis. Topiramate, an antiepileptic and anticonvulsant drug, has remarkably decreased overall pathophysiological and histopathological events in the experimental model of IBD in rodents by its cytokine inhibitory action.",Bhat MA; Usman I; Dhaneshwar S,2024,Current reviews in clinical and experimental pharmacology,19,3,234-249,10.2174/0127724328245156231008154045,"Bhat, M.

39577473,In reviewing the emerging biomarkers of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and their vesicles as potential biomarkers of cardiovascular manifestations and targets for personalized treatments.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory and pathological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, which include two main clinical subtypes: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBDs show an increase in their age-standardized global incidence rate worldwide, with no gender differences, although the age-standardized mortality rate has decreased over the years. Indeed, thanks to recent therapies with novel mechanisms of action, including those with biologics and small molecules, it has been possible to reduce the mortality rate of IBDs. However, a significant percentage of IBD patients remain refractory to these multiple advanced therapies. Therefore, another challenge of IBD research remains the development of novel therapies with novel agents or cells that could improve the quality of life and outcome of IBD patients. Furthermore, another aspect to be studied in IBDs is not only the high risk of progression not only to neoplastic transformation but also to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Consequently, 25-40 % of IBD patients present with cardiovascular manifestations. Here, we propose that the altered number and functions of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may represent one of the crucial mechanisms associated with incomplete/delayed healing of IBD and may offer the possibility of using them, as well as their vesicles and content, as novel biomarkers and potential candidates of cell therapy for IBD. The advantages and limitations are extensively described and discussed.",Balistreri CR,2024,Mechanisms of ageing and development,222,,112006,10.1016/j.mad.2024.112006,"Balistreri, C. R. (2024).

The incidence of IBD is influenced by various genetic and environmental factors, with dietary habits gaining significant scientific interest. While the role of diet in the pathogenesis and development of IBD is still debated, recent studies have demonstrated its potential impact. However, conflicting findings exist regarding the efficacy of dietary interventions in the treatment and control of IBD. This review aimed to summarize the current understanding of the relationship between diet and IBD, highlighting the different perspectives and reasonings observed in recent studies. Overall, it has been shown that dietary habits play a role in the incidence of IBD, and adopting a controlled dietary approach may help manage the disease. Consequently, diet can be considered a predictive and prognostic factor in IBD.",Ahadi M; Rouhbakhsh Zahmatkesh MR; Ebrahimi P; AkbariRad M,2024,Middle East journal of digestive diseases,16,1,5-11,10.34172/mejdd.2024.362,"Ahadi, M., Rouhbakhsh Zahmatkesh, M.

31650411,Increased risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.,"Previous studies have shown increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study is to better characterize this possible association by conducting a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of relevant literature until April 30, 2019, was performed. Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-2.42) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively. Begg's test and Egger's test suggested no publication bias. There was a 74% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with CD and 40% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with UC compared with that in non-IBD.

33584261,Thiopurines: Recent Topics and Their Role in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown etiology, characterized by repeated relapse and remission. The efficacy of thiopurine in IBD was first reported in the late 1960s. Thiopurines are used to alleviate the symptoms of IBD, especially UC. These drugs have a steroid-sparing potential and are widely used for the purpose of maintaining long-term remission in steroid-dependent cases. Therefore, thiopurines tend to be used long-term, but adverse events that accompany long-term use, such as lymphoproliferative disorders, must be monitored with care. In contrast, thiopurine plays a critical role in controlling the immunogenicity of biologics. Furthermore, although thiopurine is an old drug, new findings, including the prediction of serious adverse events such as severe alopecia and acute advanced leukopenia, by nudix hydrolase 15 gene polymorphism analysis, as well as the possibility of appropriate drug monitoring by detailed analysis of 6-thioguanine nucleotides have been clarified. However, the consequences of thiopurine withdrawal have not been determined and further studies, including randomized controlled trials, are necessary to answer the clinical question regarding the scenarios in which thiopurine withdrawal is possible.",Tominaga K; Sugaya T; Tanaka T; Kanazawa M; Iijima M; Irisawa A,2020,Frontiers in pharmacology,11,,582291,10.3389/fphar.2020.582291,"Tominaga, K., Sugaya, T., Tanaka, T., Kanazawa, M., Iijima, M., & Irisawa, A.

38793089,Exploring the Gut Microbiome's Role in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Insights and Interventions.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the intestine that significantly impairs quality of life and imposes a heavy burden on healthcare systems globally. While the exact etiology of IBD is unclear, it is influenced by genetic, environmental, immunological, and microbial factors. Recent advances highlight the gut microbiome's pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis. The microbial dysbiosis characteristic of IBD, marked by a decline in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pathogenic microbes, suggests a profound connection between microbial imbalance and disease mechanisms. This review explores diagnostic approaches to IBD that integrate clinical assessment with advanced microbiological analyses, highlighting the potential of microbiome profiling as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. In addition, it evaluates conventional and emerging treatments and discusses microbiome-targeted intervention prospects, such as probiotics, symbiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation. The necessity for future research to establish their efficacy and safety is emphasised.",Gyriki D; Nikolaidis C; Stavropoulou E; Bezirtzoglou I; Tsigalou C; Vradelis S; Bezirtzoglou E,2024,Journal of personalized medicine,14,5,,10.3390/jpm14050507,"Gyriki, D., Nikolaidis, C., Stavropoulou, E., Bezirtzoglou, I., Tsigalou, C., Vradelis, S., & Bezirtzoglou, E.

35677820,The Impact of Intestinal Ultrasound on the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: From Established Facts Toward New Horizons.,"Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) plays a crucial role as a non-invasive and accurate tool to diagnose and assess inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The rationale for using IUS in Crohn's disease (CD), a transmural disease, is widely acknowledged. While the use of IUS in ulcerative colitis (UC), a mucosal disease, is often underestimated, but, recently, it is increasingly expanding. In the context of a treat-to-target approach, the role of IUS is shifting toward a monitoring tool for predicting response to therapy. Hence, adjusting therapeutic strategies based on IUS response could reduce the burden related to endoscopy and speed the decision process with the ultimate goal to alter the natural course of IBD. Assessment of bowel wall thickness (BWT) is the most reliable IUS measure. However, the development of validated and reproducible sonographic scores to measure disease activity and the identification of parameters of therapeutic response remain relevant issues to implement the daily adoption of IUS in clinical practice. Accordingly, this review focuses on the current literature investigating the impact of IUS on CD with emphasis on the concept of transmural healing (TH) and the main related advantages. We further explore new insights on the role of IUS in UC and its clinical implications.",Nardone OM; Calabrese G; Testa A; Caiazzo A; Fierro G; Rispo A; Castiglione F,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,898092,10.3389/fmed.2022.898092,"Nardone, O.

40682559,Microalgae and Bioactive Substances Therein: Unveiling Therapeutic Promise against Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), represents a chronic and recurrent inflammatory ailment of the intestines. It strikes a harsh blow to patients' quality of life. Currently, there is a dearth of effective treatments for IBD, which causes patients to endure significant distress. Thus, it is of utmost urgency to formulate a treatment plan for IBD that is safe, effective, and affordable. In recent years, natural products have increasingly become a new strategy to alleviate IBD due to their safety and effectiveness. Among many natural products, microalgae have attracted extensive attention from researchers, owing to their abundance in a diverse range of bioactive constituents, such as polysaccharides, phycocyanin, and carotenoids. Microalgae and the bioactive compounds within them can effectively alleviate IBD. Their potential application value is discussed as they are expected to be new strategies concerning the prevention and treatment of this disease. In retrospect, we start from the pathogenesis of IBD, and combining with the deep therapeutic mechanism of microalgae-derived active ingredients, this article expounds on its broad prospects in the treatment of IBD.

40655939,The Potential Role and Effective Components of Sanyeqing as the Potential Therapeutic Candidates for IBD and CRC.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a family of chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Among the serious malignancies that can arise from IBD, colorectal cancer is particularly prevalent. Individuals suffering from both IBD and CRC often endure similar symptoms, which include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal discomfort, weight decline, and profound exhaustion. Sanyeqing is a traditional herbaceous medicinal plant with anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, heat-clearing, detoxifying, and liver-protecting effects. Here, we summarize the possible molecular mechanisms of IBD and CRC, and summarize the potential role of Sanyeqing in clinical therapy for IBD and CRC.

33233007,Increased risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed inconsistent results regarding associations between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes. The present study aimed to make a meta-analysis to assess the risk of IHD and diabetes in IBD.
METHODS: We searched for articles published before February 2020 in the databases as follows: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. We computed odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) regarding the association between IBD and risk of IHD or diabetes by using STATA 13.0 software.
RESULTS: The present meta-analysis showed that IBD was associated with higher risk of IHD (OR/RR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.20 to 1.32, I2 = 88.3 %, p < 0.0001). Additionally, both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were associated with higher risk of IHD (UC: OR/RR = 1.19, 95 % CI 1.13 to 1.26, I2 = 65.6 %, p = 0.001; CD: OR/RR = 1.33, 95 % CI 1.17 to 1.51, I2 = 89.5 %, p < 0.0001). The study showed that IBD was associated with elevated risk of diabetes (OR/RR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.53, I2 = 92.1 %, I2 = 92.1 %, p < 0.0001). Additionally, both UC and CD were associated with higher risk of diabetes (UC: OR/RR = 1.33, 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.71, I2 = 93.8 %, p < 0.0001; CD: OR/RR = 1.39, 95 % CI 1.10 to 1.76, I2 = 76.7 %, p = 0.002).

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify this issue.
METHODS: The Electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies up to 31 November 2020. The quality of eligible studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under different genetic models were calculated to assess the strength of associations.
RESULTS: A total of 22 relevant case-control studies with 9542 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 13,886 controls, as well as 13,651 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15,256 controls, were involved in our meta-analysis. rs10761659 polymorphism significantly decreased CD and UC risk (except for the heterozygous model and the dominant model in UC), and rs10995271 polymorphism was significantly associated with UC (except for the heterozygous model and dominant model) rather than CD.
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs10761659 polymorphism might be a protective factor for both UC and CD in Caucasians, while the rs10995271 polymorphism might be a risk factor for UC rather than CD in Caucasians.",Wu PB; Zhang Y; Nie G; Huang X; Yu YJ; Yin AN; Zhou R; He CP; Wang P,2021,Expert review of clinical immunology,17,8,915-921,10.1080/1744666X.2021.1939012,"Wu, P.

32649238,Case-only analysis of gene-gene interactions in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: Gene-gene interactions (G × G) potentially play a role in the etiology of complex human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and may partially explain their 'missing heritability'.
METHODS: Using the largest genotype dataset available for IBD (16,636 Crohn's disease (CD) and 12,888 ulcerative colitis (UC) cases) we analyzed G × G with the powerful case-only (CO) design. We studied 169 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for CD (156 for UC), previously shown to be associated with the respective diseases. To ensure the validity of the CO design, we confined our analysis to pairs of unlinked SNPs. We used principal component analysis at the center level to adjust for possible causes of genotypic association other than G × G, such as population stratification and genotyping batch effects. Results from center-wise logistic regression analyses were combined by a random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A number of nominally significant (p < .05) G × G interactions were observed, but none of these withstood the Bonferroni multiple testing correction. However, one SNP pair, comprising rs26528 in the IL27 gene and rs9297145 in the KPNA7 gene region was characterized by an interaction odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.10-1.27) for CD and a p-value of 7.75 × 10-6. Owing to the concurrent role of the IL27 and KPNA7 genes in NF-κB signaling, a master regulator of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes in IBD, the observed interaction also has biological plausibility.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to exemplify the utility of the CO design for analyzing G × G, but had to recognize that such interactions are probably scarce for IBD.",Aleknonytė-Resch M; Freitag-Wolf S; Schreiber S; Krawczak M; Dempfle A,2020,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,55,8,897-906,10.1080/00365521.2020.1790646,"Aleknonytė-Resch, M., Freitag-Wolf, S., Schreiber, S., Krawczak, M., & Dempfle, A.

40755720,The current landscape of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder that impacts the intestinal tract. The gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms, plays a pivotal role in the initiation, development, and progression of IBD by modulating inflammation, and immune responses, and maintaining gut homeostasis. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, is frequently observed in IBD patients and is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease by disrupting the mucosal immune system. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring feces from a healthy donor (HD) into a recipient and has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for IBD. The primary goal of FMT is to restore microbial balance in the recipient's gut, improving both microbiota composition and immune function. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated varying degrees of success in alleviating IBD symptoms through FMT. The benefits of FMT include modulation of gut bacteria abundance, restoration of microbial diversity, and enhancement of immune system regulation, all of which contribute to reducing IBD-related inflammation. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of animal studies and clinical trials exploring using FMT as a treatment for IBD. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of FMT in IBD is crucial for designing effective therapeutic strategies and optimizing its clinical impact.",Bi Y; Cheng B; Zou B; Liu S; Cui Z,2025,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,10,,55,10.21037/tgh-24-138,"Bi, Y., Cheng, B., Zou, B., Liu, S., & Cui, Z.

32419327,Targeting desmosomal adhesion and signalling for intestinal barrier stabilization in inflammatory bowel diseases-Lessons from experimental models and patients.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) have a complex and multifactorial pathogenesis which is incompletely understood. A typical feature closely associated with clinical symptoms is impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function. Mounting evidence suggests that desmosomes, which together with tight junctions (TJ) and adherens junctions (AJ) form the intestinal epithelial barrier, play a distinct role in IBD pathogenesis. This is based on the finding that desmoglein (Dsg) 2, a cadherin-type adhesion molecule of desmosomes, is required for maintenance of intestinal barrier properties both in vitro and in vivo, presumably via Dsg2-mediated regulation of TJ. Mice deficient for intestinal Dsg2 show increased basal permeability and are highly susceptible to experimental colitis. In several cohorts of IBD patients, intestinal protein levels of Dsg2 are reduced and desmosome ultrastructure is altered suggesting that Dsg2 is involved in IBD pathogenesis. In addition to its adhesive function, Dsg2 contributes to enterocyte cohesion and intestinal barrier function. Dsg2 is also involved in enterocyte proliferation, barrier differentiation and induction of apoptosis, in part by regulation of p38MAPK and EGFR signalling. In IBD, the function of Dsg2 appears to be compromised via p38MAPK activation, which is a critical pathway for regulation of desmosomes and is associated with keratin phosphorylation in IBD patients. In this review, the current findings on the role of Dsg2 as a novel promising target to prevent loss of intestinal barrier function in IBD patients are discussed.",Schlegel N; Boerner K; Waschke J,2021,"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",231,1,e13492,10.1111/apha.13492,"Schlegel, N., Boerner, K., & Waschke, J.

38429331,Type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"To investigate the association between T2DM and IBD by bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to clarify the casual relationship. Independent genetic variants for T2DM and IBD were selected as instruments from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS), mainly in European ancestry. Instrumental variables (IVs) associated with T2DM and IBD were extracted separately from the largest GWAS meta-analysis. MR analyses included inverse variance weighting, weighted median estimator, MR Egger regression, and sensitivity analyses with Steiger filtering and MR PRESSO. In the data samples for Ulcerative colitis (UC) (6968 cases, 20,464 controls) and Crohn's disease (CD) (5956 cases, 14,927 controls), there was a negative causal relationship between T2DM and UC [IVW, OR/95%CI: 0.882/(0.826,0.942), p < 0.001]. However, the causal relationships between T2DM and CD, UC and T2DM, CD and T2DM were not significant, and the p value measured by the IVW method was ≥ 0.05. All SNPs showed no significant horizontal pleiotropy (p > 0.05). The results of the bidirectional MR Study suggest that T2DM has a negative causal effect on UC, which provides implications for clinical treatment decisions in IBD patients with T2DM. The findings do not support a causal relationship between T2DM and CD, UC and T2DM, or CD and T2DM, and the impact of IBD on T2DM needs further investigation.",Xu G; Xu Y; Zheng T; Liu T,2024,Scientific reports,14,1,5149,10.1038/s41598-024-55869-x,"Xu, G., Xu, Y., Zheng, T., & Liu, T.

34964870,Causal Association Between Atopic Dermatitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A 2-Sample Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study.,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies postulated an association between atopic dermatitis (AD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal.
METHODS: To determine whether AD is causally related to IBD and vice versa, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted. Independent genetic instruments from the largest available genome-wide association study for AD (EAGLE eczema consortium without the 23andMe study including 10,788 cases and 30,047 controls) were used to investigate the association with IBD in the UK Biobank study (7045 cases, 456,327 controls) and a second European IBD sample (12,882 cases, 21,770 controls).
RESULTS: Atopic dermatitis was strongly associated with higher risk of IBD as a whole (odds ratio [OR], 1.107; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.035; 1.183; P = .003) in the UK Biobank study. The positive association was not significant in the other IBD study (OR, 1.114; 95% CI, 0.956; 1.298), but in meta-analyses of results from the 2 studies, the strong association could be confirmed (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04; 1.18). When evaluating the causal relationship in the other direction, IBD as a whole did not show an association with AD. Subtype analyses revealed that AD was suggestively associated with ulcerative colitis (UC; OR, 1.149; 95% CI, 1.018; 1.297) but not Crohn's disease (CD). However, there was a suggestive association between CD and AD (OR, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.004; 1.064) but not UC and AD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a causal effect between AD and IBD-but not between IBD and AD. There seems to be considerable differences between UC and CD regarding their specific associations with AD. These findings have implications for the management of IBD and AD in clinical practice.",Meisinger C; Freuer D,2022,Inflammatory bowel diseases,28,10,1543-1548,10.1093/ibd/izab329,"Meisinger, C., & Freuer, D.

We aimed to assess the contribution of the C3435T polymorphism to disease risk in the Polish population. A total of 100 patients (50 Crohn's disease (CD), 50 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C3435T by using the PCR-RFLP method. Patients were classified on the basis of disease phenotype and the specific treatment used. A meta-analysis was carried out of our results and those from previously published Polish studies. There was no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies in IBD patients compared with controls. For CD patients, a lower frequency of TT genotype in those with colonic disease, a lower frequency of T allele, and a higher frequency of C allele in those with luminal disease were observed, whereas for UC patients, a lower frequency of CT genotype was observed in those with left-sided colitis. A meta-analysis showed a tendency towards higher prevalence of CC genotype in UC cases. These results indicate that the C3435T variants may confer a risk for UC and influence disease behaviour.",Petryszyn P; Dudkowiak R; Gruca A; Jaźwińska-Tarnawska E; Ekk-Cierniakowski P; Poniewierka E; Wiela-Hojeńska A; Głowacka K,2021,Genes,12,9,,10.3390/genes12091419,"Petryszyn, P., Dudkowiak, R., Gruca, A., Jaźwińska-Tarnawska, E., Ekk-Cierniakowski, P., Poniewierka, E., Wiela-Hojeńska, A., & Głowacka, K.

32671616,Hepatotoxicty of Agents Used in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a 2020 Update.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continue to expand, the opportunity for hepatotoxicity remains a clinical concern. This review looks to update the current literature on drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and liver-related complications from current and emerging treatments for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
RECENT FINDINGS: An extensive literature review on currently used medications to treat IBD and their liver-related side effects that includes mesalamine, thiopurines, certain antibiotics, methotrexate, anti-TNF agents including recently introduced biosimilars, anti-integrin therapy, anti-IL 12/IL 23 therapy, and small molecule JAK inhibitors. Hepatotoxicity remains an important clinical issue when managing patients with IBD.

40205601,Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis on a global scale.,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be at higher risk of developing MetS due to chronic inflammation, altered adipokine profiles, and the effects of corticosteroid treatment. However, the prevalence of MetS in IBD patients remains inconsistent across studies. This meta-analysis aims to estimate the prevalence of MetS in IBD patients and compare its occurrence between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science from their inception up to January 19, 2025. Eligible observational studies reporting MetS prevalence in IBD patients were included. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via the I2 statistic. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software, version 4.0 was used for analysis.
RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of MetS in IBD patients was 21.8% (95% CI: 14.3-31.6%). The prevalence was higher in UC patients (32.7%, 95% CI: 16.0-55.5%) compared to CD patients (14.1%, 95% CI: 8.6-22.3%). Patients with UC had significantly higher odds of MetS than those with CD (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.85, P = 0.02). Additionally, IBD patients with MetS were significantly older than those without (MD: 9.89, 95% CI: 5.12-14.67, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In summary, this meta-analysis reveals a notable prevalence of MetS among patients with IBD, particularly in those with UC, where the prevalence is higher than in CD. The analysis also shows that IBD patients with MetS tend to be older, suggesting age as a contributing factor. These findings underscore the need for routine metabolic screening in IBD care, especially in UC and elderly patients.",Janani KV; Saberian P; Patel HB; Keetha NR; Etemadzadeh A; Patel A; Hashemi SM; Amini-Salehi E; Gurram A,2025,"Journal of health, population, and nutrition",44,1,112,10.1186/s41043-025-00860-z,"Janani, K.

32378002,Combination of Biological Agents in Moderate to Severe Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with biological agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) has become standard of care in moderate to severe pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, a significant proportion of patients experience loss of response to anti-TNFs, need treatment escalation, or develop side effects. There is no data in the literature regarding combination of biological agents in pediatric IBD.
METHODS: At our hospital, which is a tertiary referral center, we have combined the anti-TNF infliximab with either vedolizumab or ustekinumab in patients with severe pediatric IBD. The indications for dual biological therapy were insufficient efficacy of infliximab or vedolizumab monotherapy, or side effects such as psoriasis due to anti-TNFs.
RESULTS: Eight patients (four boys) aged 14-17.5 years received a combination of infliximab and vedolizumab due to only a partial response to infliximab, four with Crohn's disease (CD) and four with ulcerative colitis (UC). Clinical remission was achieved in four patients (3 UC) and four had a colectomy (3 CD, 1 UC). Five CD patients (3 girls) aged 11-17 years, on maintenance therapy with infliximab, developed psoriasis resistant to topical treatment. A combination of infliximab and ustekinumab resulted in clinical remission of CD without skin symptoms. No serious adverse events occurred in any of the patients on combination therapy. Thirteen publications report on combining biologicals, all in adult IBD.
CONCLUSION: In pediatric IBD, combining biological agents seems to be safe and beneficial in selected patients. The safety should be addressed in long-term follow-up studies.",Olbjørn C; Rove JB; Jahnsen J,2020,Paediatric drugs,22,4,409-416,10.1007/s40272-020-00396-1,"Olbjørn, C., Rove, J. B., & Jahnsen, J.

38905376,Inflammatory proteins may mediate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease: A mediation and multivariable Mendelian randomization study.,"This research investigates the causal relationships among gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and identifies the role of inflammatory proteins as potential mediators. Our study analyzed gut microbiome data from 13,266 samples collected by the MiBioGen alliance, along with inflammatory protein data from recent research by Zhao et al, and genetic data on CD and UC from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the associations, complemented by replication, meta-analysis, and multivariable MR techniques for enhanced accuracy and robustness. Our analysis employed several statistical methods, including inverse-variance weighting, MR-Egger, and the weighted median method, ensuring comprehensive and precise evaluation. After MR analysis, replication and meta-analysis, we revealed significant associations between 11 types of gut microbiota and 17 inflammatory proteins were associated with CD and UC. Mediator MR analysis and multivariable MR analysis showed that in CD, the CD40L receptor mediated the causal effect of Defluviitaleaceae UCG-011 on CD (mediation ratio 8.3%), and the Hepatocyte growth factor mediated the causal effect of Odoribacter on CD (mediation ratio 18%). In UC, the C-C motif chemokine 4 mediated the causal effect of Ruminococcus2 on UC (mediation ratio 4%). This research demonstrates the interactions between specific gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins, and CD and UC. Furthermore, the CD40L receptor may mediate the relationship between Defluviitaleaceae UCG-011 and CD; the Hepatocyte growth factor may mediate the relationship between Odoribacter and CD; and the C-C motif chemokine 4 may mediate the relationship between Ruminococcus2 and UC.

32606588,Therapeutic Oligonucleotides for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: The better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, which drive the pathological process in the gut of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans, has facilitated the development of novel therapeutic compounds. Among these, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have been used to inhibit the expression of molecules, which sustain the IBD-associated mucosal inflammation.
AREAS COVERED: In this short review, we summarize experimental and clinical data on the use of ASOs in IBD.
EXPERT OPINION: Preclinical work indicates that the modulation of specific inflammatory pathways through the use of ASOs is highly effective and associates with low risk of adverse events. Initial clinical studies have confirmed the benefit of some ASOs even though no compound has yet reached the market. Further experimentation is warranted to establish the optimal route of administration for each ASO, ascertain whether and how long ASOs maintain their activity following administration, and identify which patient can benefit from specific ASO treatment.",Marafini I; Monteleone G,2020,Biologics : targets & therapy,14,,47-51,10.2147/BTT.S257638,"Marafini, I., & Monteleone, G.

39872845,Telocytes in inflammatory bowel diseases: contributions to pathology and therapeutic potentials.,"Telocytes, a novel mesenchymal cell population, are characterized by their distinctive long and slender projections known as telopodes and have garnered significant interest since their formal introduction to the literature in 2010. These cells have been identified in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where they are suggested to play important roles in maintaining structural integrity, immune modulation, and barrier function. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis. While limited information is available on the fate of telocytes in this group of diseases, it has been suggested that loss/plasticity of telocytes can be among the key factors contributing to their pathogenesis. This review focuses on the current understanding of telocytes, their structural features, and their distribution within the GI tract under gut homeostasis and IBD. We also discuss the roles of these cells in immune regulation and intestinal repair. We highlight evidence implicating telocytes in the pathogenesis of IBD and other chronic inflammatory diseases that share similar pathophysiological processes with IBD. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges in gut telocyte biology and the potential therapeutic implications of telocytes in IBD.",Panganiban RP; McAninch C; Chulkina M; Pinchuk IV,2024,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,12,,1452258,10.3389/fcell.2024.1452258,"Panganiban, R.

33214955,Role of Substance P in the Pathophysiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Its Correlation With the Degree of Inflammation.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multi-factorial, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, containing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In UC, inflammation and sores are confined morphologically and microscopically to the mucosa, the innermost surface of the colon and the rectum. Although, in CD, the infection is granulomatous and transmural, affecting the entire gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, with the skip area in-between. A Neuropeptide, substance P (SP), which acts as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator, plays a vital role in the brain-gut axis under stress. Owing to the pro-inflammatory effects of SP, neuropeptide dysregulation induces inflammation in the intestine. There are variations in the distribution of substance P immunoreactive fibres in the various intestinal layers. The highest concentration of SP is in the mucosa and the lowest concentration in the lamina propria of the intestinal muscular membrane. Reduced vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels and elevated SP levels observed in the colonic mucosa of IBD by using immunohistochemistry and immunoassay. This literature review aims to find out the correlations between the level of substance P (SP) and disease activity. We conducted a literature review on IBD, SP, and we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant articles in English. The result of the study supports a positive relationship between the level of substance P (SP) and disease activity, with increased concentration of substance p in the colon and rectum of CD and UC patients. It is concluded that patients with active CD, along with inflammatory changes, had elevated plasma SP levels and immunoreactivity of SP in the colon than those seen in control and inactive cases. These alterations are more prevalent in ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease and are more prevalent in the moderately infected area than the least affected area of the intestine.",Patel M; Valaiyaduppu Subas S; Ghani MR; Busa V; Dardeir A; Marudhai S; Cancarevic I,2020,Cureus,12,10,e11027,10.7759/cureus.11027,"Patel, M., Valaiyaduppu Subas, S., Ghani, M.

33216452,An Insight into the Roles of Dietary Tryptophan and Its Metabolites in Intestinal Inflammation and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex, chronic, and relapsing gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, which includes mainly two conditions, namely ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Development of IBD in any individual is closely related to his/her autoimmune regulation, gene-microbiota interactions, and dietary factors. Dietary tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid for intestinal mucosal cells, and it is associated with the intestinal inflammation, epithelial barrier, and energy homeostasis of the host. According to recent studies, Trp and its three major metabolic pathways, namely kynurenine (KYN) pathway, indole pathway, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) pathway, have vital roles in the regulation of intestinal inflammation by acting directly or indirectly on the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines, functions of various immune cells, as well as the intestinal microbial composition and homeostasis. In this review, recent advances in Trp- and its metabolites-associated intestinal inflammation are summarized. It further discusses the complex mechanisms and interrelationships of the three major metabolic pathways of Trp in regulating inflammation, which could elucidate the value of dietary Trp to be used as a nutrient for IBD patients.",Li X; Zhang ZH; Zabed HM; Yun J; Zhang G; Qi X,2021,Molecular nutrition & food research,65,5,e2000461,10.1002/mnfr.202000461,"Li, X., Zhang, Z.

38030696,Mitochondrial DNA copy number is associated with Crohn's disease: a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Mitochondrial DNA plays a critical role in the pathophysiological process of inflammation. However, the relationship between mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains poorly understood. We conducted a comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) using three instrumental variables (IVs) to explore the causal associations between mtDNA-CN and IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC). MR-Egger regression, weighted median, inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods were used to evaluate the potential causal associations. The robustness of the IVW estimates was determined using the leave-one-out sensitivity test. A meta-analysis was conducted to pool the results from the three sets of IVs. Upon analysis, the findings of the current study revealed that genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was not associated with IBD (CD + UC) and UC. The results of MR analyses between mtDNA-CN and CD risk were inconsistent by using three sets of IVs. After a meta-analysis, we found that genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was associated with CD risk (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.37-3.18). This finding was also confirmed by multivariable MR analyses and remained robust when tested with the leave-one-out sensitivity test. In conclusion, genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was found to be associated with CD risk. Therefore, mtDNA levels in the blood could potentially be used as a marker for CD risk assessment. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and validate the results of this study.",Cai X; Li X; Liang C; Zhang M; Xu Y; Dong Z; Weng Y; Yu W,2023,Scientific reports,13,1,21016,10.1038/s41598-023-48175-5,"Cai, X., Li, X., Liang, C., Zhang, M., Xu, Y., Dong, Z., Weng, Y., & Yu, W.

40650291,Psychopharmacological Therapy Positively Modulates Disease Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Depression, anxiety, and perceived stress are common comorbidities in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may negatively influence the disease course. Likewise, severe IBD may contribute to the development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Despite the established relevance of the gut-brain axis and frequent use of psychotropic medications in IBD patients, limited evidence exists regarding the effects of psychiatric treatments on gastrointestinal disease activity. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of psychiatric therapies on gastrointestinal symptoms and disease activity in patients with IBD. The work was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were performed across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to July 2024. Eligible studies evaluated the effectiveness of psychiatric medications-including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and others-on at least one gastrointestinal outcome in patients with IBD. Outcomes included changes in commonly used clinical and endoscopic scores for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), number of bowel movements, stool consistency, presence of blood in stool, severity of abdominal pain, as well as in surrogate markers of disease activity following treatment. Out of 8513 initially identified articles, 22 studies involving 45,572 IBD patients met the inclusion criteria. Antidepressants, particularly bupropion, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), venlafaxine, and duloxetine, were associated with improvements in IBD activity scores, including Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) for CD, Mayo score and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) for UC. Case reports highlighted potential benefits of pregabalin and lithium carbonate, respectively, showed by the reduction in clinical and endoscopic score of disease activity for pregabalin and improvement of UC symptoms for lithium carbonate, while topiramate showed limited efficacy. Clonidine and naltrexone determined the reductions in clinical and endoscopic score of disease activity, including CDAI and Crohn's disease endoscopy index severity score (CDEIS) for CD and Disease Activity Index (DAI) for UC. Despite the limited data and study heterogeneity, antidepressants, naltrexone, and clonidine were associated with improvements in IBD activity. Larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic potential of psychiatric medications in modulating IBD activity and to guide integrated clinical management.",Di Vincenzo F; D'Onofrio AM; Del Gaudio A; Chiera E; Ferrajoli GF; Pesaresi F; Simonetti A; Mazza M; Kotzalidis GD; Pettorruso M; Martinotti G; Lopetuso LR; Gasbarrini A; Sani G; Fiorino G; Scaldaferri F; Camardese G,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,13,,10.3390/ijms26136514,"Di Vincenzo, F., D'Onofrio, A.

39195452,Marine Algae and Deriving Biomolecules for the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Potential Clinical Therapeutics to Decrease Gut Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Markers?,"The term ""inflammatory bowel disease"" (IBD) describes a class of relapse-remitting conditions that affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Among these, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two of the most globally prevalent and debilitating conditions. Several articles have brought attention to the significant role that inflammation and oxidative stress cooperatively play in the development of IBD, offering a different viewpoint both on its etiopathogenesis and on strategies for the effective treatment of these conditions. Marine ecosystems may be a significant source of physiologically active substances, supporting the search for new potential clinical therapeutics. Based on this evidence, this review aims to comprehensively evaluate the activity of marine algae and deriving biomolecules in decreasing pathological features of CD and UC. To match this purpose, a deep search of the literature on PubMed (MEDLINE) and Google Scholar was performed to highlight primary biological mechanisms, the modulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress biochemical parameters, and potential clinical benefits deriving from marine species. From our findings, both macroalgae and microalgae have shown potential as therapeutic solutions for IBD due to their bioactive compounds and their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities which are capable of modulating markers such as cytokines, the NF-κB pathway, reactive oxidative and nitrosative species (ROS and RNS), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), lactoferrin, SIRT1, etc. However, while we found promising preclinical evidence, more extensive and long-term clinical studies are necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of marine algae for IBD treatment.",Repici A; Hasan A; Capra AP; Scuderi SA; Paterniti I; Campolo M; Ardizzone A; Esposito E,2024,Marine drugs,22,8,,10.3390/md22080336,"Repici, A., Hasan, A., Capra, A.

37094358,Therapeutic Potential of Human Intestinal Organoids in Tissue Repair Approaches in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic immune-mediated conditions characterized by significant gut tissue damage due to uncontrolled inflammation. Anti-inflammatory treatments have improved, but there are no current prorepair approaches. Organoids have developed into a powerful experimental platform to study mechanisms of human diseases. Here, we specifically focus on its role as a direct tissue repair modality in IBD. We discuss the scientific rationale for this, recent parallel advances in scientific technologies (CRISPR [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats]/Cas9 and metabolic programming), and in addition, the clinical IBD context in which this therapeutic approach is tractable. Finally, we review the translational roadmap for the application of organoids and the need for this as a novel direction in IBD.",Rutherford D; Ho GT,2023,Inflammatory bowel diseases,29,9,1488-1498,10.1093/ibd/izad044,"Rutherford, D., & Ho, G.

37629560,The Role of Plant-Derived Natural Products in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-What Is the Clinical Evidence So Far?,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are a major healthcare challenge worldwide. Disturbances in the immune system and gut microbiota followed by environmental triggers are thought to be part of the aetiological factors. Current treatment for IBD includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and other biologic agents; however, some patients are still unresponsive, and these are also linked to high financial load and severe side effects. Plant-derived natural products are rich in phytochemicals and have been used as healing agents in several diseases since antiquity due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, as well as gut microbiota modulation. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that phytochemicals act in key pathways that are associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. It is also reported that the use of plant-derived natural products as complementary treatments is increasing amongst patients with IBD to avoid the side effects accompanying standard medical treatment. This review summarises the relevant evidence around the use of plant-derived natural products in the management of IBD, with specific focus on the clinical evidence so far for Curcumin, Mastiha, Boswellia serrata, and Artemisia absinthium.",Davila MM; Papada E,2023,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",13,8,,10.3390/life13081703,"Davila, M.

39968296,Thyroid disorders and inflammatory bowel disease: an association present in adults but also in children and adolescents.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) represent chronic inflammatory multisystemic disorders that primarily involve the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) exhibit a higher prevalence of thyroid disorders compared to the general population. The aim of this review is to summarize the literature on concomitant IBD and thyroid disorders, specifically autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), as well as thyroid cancer, with a focus on children and adolescents. We provide an overview of the age-related differences between children and adults in the prevalence of this association. Literature shows that relatively few studies have been conducted on this subject in pediatric populations. The etiopathogenetic similarities between IBD and autoimmune thyroiditis are undeniable. Nevertheless, current data does not indicate a unanimous association between GD and HT and chronic IBD (both CD and UC). Although evidence suggests a potential association between IBD and thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid cancer, the precise nature of this relationship varies across studies and is influenced by multiple factors. The limited information regarding the relationship between IBD and thyroid disorders in children highlights a significant knowledge gap. Since the thyroid plays a critical role in the pediatric population's development, it is essential to promptly recognize and treat thyroid diseases. A thyroid function monitoring and future research exploring the genetic and immunologic connections are essential to enhance our understanding of the interrelation between IBD and thyroid disorders.",Calcaterra V; Penagini F; Rossi V; Abbattista L; Bianchi A; Turzi M; Cococcioni L; Zuccotti G,2025,Frontiers in endocrinology,16,,1425241,10.3389/fendo.2025.1425241,"Calcaterra, V., Penagini, F., Rossi, V., Abbattista, L., Bianchi, A., Turzi, M., Cococcioni, L., & Zuccotti, G.

32560118,Oral Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and the Role of Non-Invasive Surrogate Markers of Disease Activity.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can be associated with several extra-intestinal manifestations requiring a multidisciplinary management both in terms of work-up and therapy. Oral lesions are common in patients with IBD, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 50%. These can represent an oral location of IBD as well as a side-effect of drugs used to treat the intestinal disease. Oral manifestations, occurring in patients with IBD, can be divided in nonmalignant, specific, and non-specific ones, and malignant lesions. While there is undoubtedly a need to search for an IBD in patients with oral lesions associated with intestinal symptoms, the work-up of those with an exclusive oral lesion should be personalized. Fecal calprotectin is a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation and may be used to select which patients need to undergo endoscopic examination, thereby avoiding unnecessary investigations. The pharmacological armamentarium to treat oral lesions associated with IBD includes topical or systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic drugs.",Ribaldone DG; Brigo S; Mangia M; Saracco GM; Astegiano M; Pellicano R,2020,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",7,6,,10.3390/medicines7060033,"Ribaldone, D.

34571853,Role of MicroRNA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Evidence and the Development of Preclinical Animal Models.,"The dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) is implicated in cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular disorders, drug resistance, and aging. While most researchers study miRNA's role as a biomarker, for example, to distinguish between various sub-forms or stages of a given disease of interest, research is also ongoing to utilize these small nucleic acids as therapeutics. An example of a common pleiotropic disease that could benefit from miRNA-based therapeutics is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small and large intestines. Due to complex interactions between multiple factors in the etiology of IBD, development of therapies that effectively maintain remission for this disease is a significant challenge. In this review, we discuss the role of dysregulated miRNA expression in the context of clinical ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)-the two main forms of IBD-and the various preclinical mouse models of IBD utilized to validate the therapeutic potential of targeting these miRNA. Additionally, we highlight advances in the development of genetically engineered animal models that recapitulate clinical miRNA expression and provide powerful preclinical models to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic promise of miRNA in IBD.",Suri K; Bubier JA; Wiles MV; Shultz LD; Amiji MM; Hosur V,2021,Cells,10,9,,10.3390/cells10092204,"Suri, K., Bubier, J.

40904825,Review study of alteration functional activities and networks in ulcerative colitis using resting-state fMRI.,"BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is linked to neuropsychiatric comorbidities and changes in brain connectivity through the brain-gut axis. Resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to examining these neural alterations; however, no comprehensive review has compiled findings specific to UC.
OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes RS-fMRI studies to characterize functional connectivity (FC) alterations and methodological approaches in UC patients compared to healthy controls (HCs) and other inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subtypes.
METHODS: Literature searches were performed in Ovid, PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE (up to July 2025) using keywords: resting-state fMRI, RS-FMRI, ulcerative colitis, and UC. Few studies meeting the inclusion criteria (human participants, UC diagnosis, RS-fMRI analysis) were reviewed.
KEY FINDINGS: Seven studies were included in this review. UC patients show disrupted FC in the salience, cerebellar, visual, default mode, and dorsal attention networks. Reduced hippocampal activity is linked to working memory deficits, while increased FC in corticolimbic areas (e.g., caudate anterior, cingulate) correlates with active inflammation. Grey matter volume decreases in cerebellar regions and increases in parahippocampal regions. Sex-specific differences in FC are observed, especially in the visual and attention networks. Altered FC patterns are associated with the severity of anxiety, depression, and stress. UC exhibits distinct neural signatures compared to CD.
IMPLICATIONS: RS-fMRI uncovers UC-specific neural phenotypes, advancing the mechanistic understanding of brain-gut interactions. These findings highlight potential biomarkers for neuropsychiatric comorbidities and support the use of integrated fMRI in clinical assessments. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, larger cohorts, and AI-enhanced analytics to clarify causality and identify therapeutic targets.",Alyami AS,2025,Frontiers in neurology,16,,1608371,10.3389/fneur.2025.1608371,"Alyami, A.

39799299,Inflammatory bowel disease increases the risk of pancreatitis: a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and pancreatitis, including acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). We aimed to examine the potential causal relationship between IBD and pancreatitis using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method.
METHODS: We obtained data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European individuals for IBD and its main subtypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (31,665 IBD cases, 13,768 UC cases, 17,897 CD cases and 33,977 controls). Four independent summary statistics of pancreatitis from the the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, 10,630 AP cases and 844,679 controls, 1,424 CP cases and 476,104 controls) and FinnGen Consortium (8,446 AP cases, 4,820 CP cases and 437,418 controls) were used for bidirectional MR analyses and sensitivity analysis. Finally, further meta-analysis was conducted on the MR results.
RESULTS: Generally, IBD is associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis (IBD-AP, OR = 1.050, 95% CI 1.020-1.080, P = 7.20 × 10-5; IBD-CP, OR = 1.050, 95% CI 1.010-1.090, P = 0.019). In addition, UC increased the risk of pancreatitis (UC-AP, OR = 1.050, 95% CI 1.020-1.070, P = 9.10 × 10-5; UC-CP, OR = 1.090, 95% CI 1.040-1.140, P = 1.44 × 10-4) and CD increased the risk of acute pancreatitis (OR = 1.040, 95% CI 1.020-1.060, P = 9.61 × 10-5). However, no causal association was found between CD and the risk of chronic pancreatitis (P > 0.05). The reverse MR results showed that AP may be associated with a reduced risk of IBD and CD (AP-IBD, OR = 0.880, 95% CI 0.810-0.960, P = 0.003; AP-CD, OR = 0.830, 95% CI 0.730-0.940, P = 0.003). However, there is no causal relationship between AP and the risk of UC, and there is no causal relationship between CP and the risk of IBD and its subtypes(P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, based on MR analysis and meta-analysis, our results showed a positive causal effect of IBD on pancreatitis, and subgroup analyses showed that UC and CD may promote the development of acute pancreatitis, whereas UC may promote the development of chronic pancreatitis. Reverse MR analysis suggests that AP may have a potential protective effect on IBD and CD.",Fang LH; Zhang JQ; Huang JK; Tang XD,2025,BMC gastroenterology,25,1,13,10.1186/s12876-024-03571-7,"Fang, L.

38716215,From random to precise: updated colon cancer screening and surveillance for inflammatory bowel disease.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). The pathogenesis of CRC in IBD differs from sporadic cancer, with the burden of inflammation being an important contributing factor. Other risk factors for developing CRC in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) includes a family history of CRC, personal history of dysplasia, history of strictures, or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Dysplasia is the precursor of cancer and ensuring effective surveillance strategies is vital for early detection and intervention. In the past, dysplasia detection relied on random biopsies, but recent studies have shown that, with the adaptation of high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE), dye sprayed chromoendoscopy (DCE) and virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE), dysplasia detection has improved. While there exists a certain degree of consensus amongst experts regarding the management of dysplasia, it is important to implement a personalized approach to each patient's care. Our review focuses on advancements in the past two decades, specifically highlighting the modifications that have been implemented since the SCENIC guidelines. It also explores future directions, including the potential implementation of stool studies as a non-invasive tool for surveillance and the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) in dysplasia detection.",Fatakhova K; Rajapakse R,2024,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,9,,27,10.21037/tgh-23-36,"Fatakhova, K., & Rajapakse, R.

36159838,Are neurodegenerative diseases associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease? A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease [PD] and Alzheimer's disease [AD]) are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the causality and direction of their associations remain unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have explored the causal effects of IBD on PD and AD. However, only a few studies examined this reverse association. Thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PD and AD with IBD, using a two-sample MR study.
METHODS: Summary statistics for IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included the International IBD Genetics Consortium and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium (n=59,957). Genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of GWAS of PD (n=1,474,097) and AD (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. We used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD. To confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations.
RESULTS: The results of the IVW method, WM, and RAPS showed that genetically predicted PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC (odds ratio [OR]IVW=1.068, OR WM=1.107, OR RAPS=1.069, all P<0.05). Additionally, we found that there were significant associations of genetically predicted PD with CD (OR IVW=1.064, OR RAPS=1.065, all P<0.05) and IBD (OR IVW=1.062, OR RAPS=1.063, all P<0.05) using the IVW method and RAPS. However, there was no significant causal evidence of genetically predicted AD in IBD, UC, or CD among all MR methods. In all MR analyses, there were no horizontal pleiotropy (all P>0.05), or statistical heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis results of the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the causal effect estimations of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study corroborated a causal association between genetically predicted PD and IBD but did not support a causal effect of genetically predicted AD on IBD. More animal experiments or population-based observational studies are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms of PD and IBD.",Cui G; Li S; Ye H; Yang Y; Huang Q; Chu Y; Shi Z; Zhang X,2022,Frontiers in immunology,13,,956005,10.3389/fimmu.2022.956005,"Cui, G., Li, S., Ye, H., Yang, Y., Huang, Q., Chu, Y., Shi, Z., & Zhang, X.

In the last few decades, the scientific world has witnessed many developments in IBD management by controlling debilitating symptoms and remaining in remission for more protracted periods. Even so, we still have a large population suffering from active IBD. An individual's quality of life (QoL) can be severely affected by IBD, like any other chronic illness. In this article, we have reviewed factors influencing the QoL in IBD patients, including chronic pain, diet, physical activity, and psychological factors like depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We also discussed the mechanisms of diet-microbial-immune system interaction, currently available dietary therapies for active CD and UC, and early psycho-social interventions that can reduce the disease burden and improve QoL in IBD patients.",Khan S; Sebastian SA; Parmar MP; Ghadge N; Padda I; Keshta AS; Minhaz N; Patel A,2024,Disease-a-month : DM,70,1S,101672,10.1016/j.disamonth.2023.101672,"Khan, S., Sebastian, S.

38465431,The Multiple Roles of Heat Shock Proteins in the Development of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammatory condition of the human intestine, comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increases the risk of developing colorectal carcinoma. Although the etiology of IBD remains ambiguous, complex interactions between genetic predisposition, microbiota, epithelial barrier, and immune factors have been implicated. The disruption of intestinal homeostasis is a cardinal characteristic of IBD. Patients with IBD exhibit intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, impaired epithelial tight junctions, and immune dysregulation; however, the relationship between them is not completely understood. As the largest body surface is exposed to the external environment, the gastrointestinal tract epithelium is continuously subjected to environmental and endogenous stressors that can disrupt cellular homeostasis and survival. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are endogenous factors that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, such as maintaining intestinal homeostasis and influencing IBD progression. Specifically, HSPs share an intricate association with microbes, intestinal epithelium, and the immune system. In this review, we aim to elucidate the impact of HSPs on IBD development by examining their involvement in the interactions between the intestinal microbiota, epithelial barrier, and immune system. The recent clinical and animal models and cellular research delineating the relationship between HSPs and IBD are summarized. Additionally, new perspectives on IBD treatment approaches have been proposed.",Su J; Wang H; Wang Z,2025,Current molecular medicine,25,2,132-145,10.2174/0115665240286793240306053111,"Su, J., Wang, H., & Wang, Z.

34471409,The Role of T Follicular Helper Cells and Interleukin-21 in the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells represent a novel subset of CD4+ T cells which can provide critical help for germinal center (GC) formation and antibody production. The Tfh cells are characterized by the expression of CXC chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5), programmed death 1 (PD-1), inducible costimulatory molecule (ICOS), B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), and the secretion of interleukin-21 (IL-21). Given the important role of Tfh cells in B cell activation and high-affinity antibody production, Tfh cells are involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are the most studied types of IBD. Dysregulated mucosal immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. In recent years, many studies have identified the critical role of Tfh cells and IL-21 in the pathogenic process IBD. In this paper, we will discuss the role of Tfh cells and IL-21 in IBD pathogenesis.",Sun L; Kong R; Li H; Wang D,2021,Gastroenterology research and practice,2021,,9621738,10.1155/2021/9621738,"Sun, L., Kong, R., Li, H., & Wang, D.

38720886,Causal relationship between eosinophilic esophagitis and inflammatory bowel disease: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are immune-mediated gastrointestinal diseases with overlapped pathogenesis and are sometimes concurrently diagnosed, but their causal relationship remains unclear. We investigated the causal relationship between EoE and IBD and its subtypes via a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.
METHODS: MR analyses were performed using summary data of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on individuals of European ancestry. Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms correlated with EoE (from a GWAS meta-analysis containing 1,930 cases and 13,634 controls) and IBD (from FinnGen GWASs containing 9,083 IBD, 2,033 CD, and 5,931 UC cases, and GWASs of IBD genetic consortium containing 12,882 IBD, 6,968 UC, and 5,956 CD cases) were selected as instruments. We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis followed by several sensitivity analyses. For the forward MR study, estimates from IVW methods were subsequently meta-analyzed using a random-effect model.
RESULTS: Our results suggested a causal effect of EoE on IBD [pooled odds ratio (OR), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.13] and EoE on UC (pooled OR, 1.09, 95% CI, 1.04-1.14). No causal link between EoE and CD was observed (pooled OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96-1.16). The reverse MR analyses revealed no causal effect of IBD (and its subtypes) on EoE. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of primary results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided evidence of a suggestive causal effect of EoE on IBD (specifically on UC) in the European population. Increased awareness of concurrent or subsequent IBD in patients with EoE is called for. Still, the present evidence is not adequate enough and ought to be validated by further investigations.",Ji R; Zhi Y,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1374107,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1374107,"Ji, R., & Zhi, Y.

38665135,C-reactive Protein: An Inflammatory Biomarker and a Predictor of Neurodegenerative Disease in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two chronic conditions of the digestive tract: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), representing a progressive inflammatory process that mainly occurs in the gut, with frequent extra-intestinal manifestations. Even if remission is periodically obtained for some patients, the histological activity and digestive symptoms may continue, maintaining a persistent systemic inflammation that could induce further extra-intestinal complications and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase reactant that is widely accepted as a dominant serum biomarker in IBD. CRP consequently activates the complement cascade, supports the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the clearance of microbial pathogens. All these processes facilitate further processes, including atherosclerosis and hypercoagulability, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and the increased permeability of the intestinal barrier for neurotoxic substances produced by gut microorganisms, due to the presence of a high level of lipopolysaccharides. For IBD, the connection between intestinal inflammation and central nervous system inflammation could be explained through the activity of the vagus nerve, a carrier of cytokines, CRP, and toxic materials to the brain, potentially inducing vascular lesions and damage of the glial vascular unit, with further risk for degeneration within the central nervous system. CRP is a key marker for IBD pathogenesis and is able to dissociate into its monomeric form, mCRP, on contact with activated cell and tissue components via the systemic circulation. We hypothesize that the chronic inflammatory process within IBD could initiate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and therefore, further investigation of the significance of chronically raised plasma of CRP and mCRP in patients with IBD is warranted, as it may represent a critical predictive factor associated with a later neurodegenerative risk. Any future initiative aimed at pharmacologic modulation of CRP (e.g., blocking CRP-mCRP dissociation), could represent a new therapeutic approach protecting against intestinal inflammation and concomitantly reducing the risk of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline.",Muresan S; Slevin M,2024,Cureus,16,4,e59009,10.7759/cureus.59009,"Muresan, S., & Slevin, M.

Emerging evidence reveals a notable epidemiological and pathogenic overlap between HS and IBD, particularly CD. Although a bidirectional association between HS and IBD has been well documented, current evidence supports a causal effect of IBD on the development of HS, while a causal relationship in the opposite direction has yet to be established. The present review explores the important association between these immune-mediated conditions and further highlights shared risk factors, genetic predispositions and immunopathogenic mechanisms, such as dysbiosis and cytokine dysregulation, involved in both HS and IBD. Diagnostic challenges, especially in differentiating perianal HS from perianal CD, are also discussed. The coexistence of HS and IBD impacts disease severity, treatment response, and overall management strategies. Shared therapeutic approaches, such as TNF-α inhibitors and JAK inhibitors, are considered promising options for effectively managing patients affected by both conditions. Nevertheless, deeper understanding of the gut-skin axis that will offer potential for more precise interventions in patients with simultaneous HS and IBD is considered imperative.",Mpakogiannis K; Fousekis FS; Karampinis E; Mastoridou E; Gaitanis G; Katsanos KH,2025,Biomedicines,13,8,,10.3390/biomedicines13081833,"Mpakogiannis, K., Fousekis, F.

33315320,[Polyphenols in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases].,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic diseases. The exact etiology of IBD is not well elucidated, however it is defined as a multifactorial disease. In addition, IBD carries the risk of serious complications and increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Also, in recent years, an increased rate of IBD cases has been noted. So far, there is no effective and well-defined therapy for IBD, and currently available drugs mainly provide symptomatic treatment. Unfortunately, conventional treatment does not always bring the expected benefits, moreover, it is often associated with unpleasant side effects. Currently, some research have been focused on unconventional forms of IBD treatment, testing therapies based on natural products. Individual polyphenols, as well as polyphenol-rich preparations and extracts are also valuable in IBD treatment through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and bactericidal activity. Moreover, described here results of clinical trials suggest that polyphenols can alleviate symptoms and prevent recurrence of IBD.",Chojnacka K; Laskowska J,2020,Postepy biochemii,66,3,256-262,10.18388/pb.2020_334,"Chojnacka, K., & Laskowska, J.

40187540,Small molecule drug absorption in inflammatory bowel disease and current implementation in physiologically- based pharmacokinetic models.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, with predominant localization in the colon in ulcerative colitis (UC) or affecting the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract in Crohn's disease (CD). Recent advances in the drug development space have been marked by a return to orally administered small molecules with novel mechanisms of action such as Janus kinase inhibitors. Additionally, the prevalence of certain chronic conditions is higher in IBD patients, many of which are treated with orally administered drugs. Given the pathophysiology and localization of IBD, altered drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract can be expected. This review discusses several physiological differences between the small and large intestine with the potential to influence drug absorption including pathophysiology related alterations associated with IBD. The main physiological parameters which are identified include luminal fluid volume, luminal pH, transit time, bile salt concentration, microbiome, absorptive surface area, permeability and metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Literature regarding these factors in IBD patients is marked with high heterogeneity in reporting of disease severity and location leading to difficulties in interpreting data across different studies. While the influence of most of these factors has been directly assessed in healthy volunteers, this is rarely the case for IBD patients. Furthermore, studies which used PBPK modelling to describe the PK of an orally administered drug in an IBD population and were able to verify their findings using clinical data are critically examined. These models were able to incorporate the pathophysiological changes associated with IBD and partly succeeded in adequately predicting drug absorption in this population. Given the limited amount of PBPK studies performed on a limited number of drugs, the developed models are most likely not suitable to be used as a general PBPK model for the IBD population.",Langeraert J; Gasthuys E; Vermeulen A,2025,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,209,,107095,10.1016/j.ejps.2025.107095,"Langeraert, J., Gasthuys, E., & Vermeulen, A.

40806882,Intestinal Microbiota and Fecal Transplantation in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Clostridioides difficile: An Updated Literature Review.,"Background/Objectives: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic relapsing and remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an FDA-approved treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs), with promising potential in patients with IBD. This manuscript aimed to provide a comprehensive and updated review of the available literature on fecal microbiota transplantation, its clinical use in IBD in general, as well as in patients with IBD and CDI. Methods: An extensive literature search was performed from October 2024 to March 2025. All publications available within PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases were reviewed. All original articles, case reports, review articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included. Qualitative and quantitative data were both extracted. Discussion: Intestinal microbiota is an integral part of the human body, and dysbiosis (an imbalance in the gut's microbial community) has been linked with several pathologies. Dysbiosis in IBD is marked by reduced beneficial bacteria and increased pro-inflammatory pathogens, contributing to mucosal damage and immune dysregulation. FMT has emerged as a solution to dysbiosis, with the first case recorded in 1917. FMT has been successful in treating patients with CDI. The diagnostic value of the gut microbiome is currently being explored as a possible therapeutic approach to IBD. Several studies have assessed FMT in patients with IBD and CDI with promising results in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) but varying efficacy based on administration routes, donor selection, and processing methods. In the context of recurrent CDI in patients with IBD, FMT demonstrates a high cure rate and potential benefit in concurrently improving IBD activity. However, risks such as IBD flare-ups post-FMT remain a concern. Conclusions: FMT holds promising potential in the management of CDI in patients with IBD. By restoring microbial diversity and correcting dysbiosis, FMT offers a novel, microbiota-targeted alternative to conventional therapies. While data support its efficacy in improving disease remission, variability in outcomes underscores the need for standardized protocols and additional large-scale, controlled studies. Continued research efforts into donor selection, treatment regimens, and long-term safety will be critical to optimizing FMT's role in IBD and CDI care as well as improving patient outcomes.",Lahoud C; Habib T; Kalta D; Dimachkie R; El Sayegh S; Deeb L,2025,Journal of clinical medicine,14,15,,10.3390/jcm14155260,"Lahoud, C., Habib, T., Kalta, D., Dimachkie, R., El Sayegh, S., & Deeb, L.

40313162,Are single nucleotide polymorphisms underutilized for guiding treatment of inflammatory bowel disease?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and IBD unclassified (IBDU), significantly impacts quality of life. Despite significant advances in the management of the conditions, responses to treatments vary greatly, and this is due partly to our natural genetic variation. Here we will review the evidence for whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have the potential to guide treatment decisions for people with IBD. We will first consider SNPs that exhibit strong associations with IBD pathogenesis and their relevance to epithelial barrier integrity, cytokine production, and immune system function. Then, we will cover those SNPs implicated in altering response to our various current IBD therapeutics, including the recently implemented drugs ustekinumab and tofacitinib. Finally, we will explore lesser-known SNPs that exhibit complex relationships with the disease and which may be undervalued as pharmacogenetic tools. Overall, it will be demonstrated that SNPs associated with IBD pathology are largely distinct from those predicting response to treatments and that new discoveries of clinically useful tools can be expected from therapy-focused investigations. Given the growing list of treatments available, we argue that beneficial personalization of treatments based on SNPs is still underutilized.",van der Werf J; Fleming NI,2025,Immunology and cell biology,103,6,551-562,10.1111/imcb.70029,"van der Werf, J., & Fleming, N.

31728561,Genetic association between IL23R rs11209026 and rs10889677 polymorphisms and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: evidence from 41 studies.,"OBJECTIVE: IL23R plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IL23R rs11209026 and rs10889677 polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). But the results were inconsistent and inconclusive. So, we aim to investigate the genetic association between rs11209026 and rs10889677 polymorphisms and UC and CD risk by a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Literature search was conducted through PubMed, CNKI, and web of science databases. Pooled OR and 95% CI was used to assess the association between the allelic, dominant and recessive models of IL23R rs11209026 and rs10889677 polymorphisms and UC and CD risk.
RESULTS: 41 publications with 13,803 patients with CD and 17,446 controls, as well as 5876 patients with UC and 10,053 controls were included in the present study. All the genetic models of rs11209026 polymorphism significantly decrease CD and UC risk (except for the recessive model in UC) (p < 0.05). A subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed that the allelic (p < 0.00001, OR = 0.65) and dominant models (p < 0.00001, OR = 0.61) of rs11209026 polymorphism were significantly associated with UC risk in Caucasians, but not in Asians (p > 0.05). In addition, the allelic (CD: p < 0.00001, OR = 1.34; UC: p < 0.00001, OR = 1.22) and dominant models (CD: p = 0.002, OR = 1.39; UC: p = 0.01, OR = 1.29), but not the recessive model of rs10889677 polymorphism significantly increase the risk of CD and UC (p > 0.05). A subgroup analysis showed that the genetic models of rs10889677 polymorphism were associated with CD risk in Caucasians (p < 0.05), but not in Asians (p > 0.05). The dominant model of rs10889677 polymorphism was associated with UC risk in Asians (p = 0.04, OR = 1.54), but not in Caucasians (p > 0.05).

The variant rs2241880 can diminish these capabilities, potentially contributing to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: To perform an updated meta-analysis on the association between ATG16L1 rs2241880 and IBD susceptibility by exploring the impact of age, ethnicity, and geography. Moreover, to investigate the association between rs2241880 and clinical features.
METHODS: Literature searches up until September 2022 across 7 electronic public databases were performed for all case-control studies on ATG16L1 rs2241880 and IBD. Pooled odds ratios (ORP ) and 95% CI were calculated under the random effects model.
RESULTS: Our analyses included a total of 30,606 IBD patients, comprising 21,270 Crohn's disease (CD) and 9336 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 33,329 controls. ATG16L1 rs2241880 was significantly associated with CD susceptibility, where the A allele was protective (ORP : 0.74, 95% CI: 0.72-0.77, p-value: <0.001), while the G allele was a risk factor (ORP : 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09-1.39, p-value: 0.001), depending on the minor allele frequencies observed in this multi-ancestry study sample. rs2241880 was predominantly relevant in Caucasians from North America and Europe, and in Latin American populations. Importantly, CD patients harbouring the G allele were significantly more predisposed to perianal disease (ORP : 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07-1.38, p-value: 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: ATG16L1 rs2241880 (G allele) is a consistent risk factor for IBD in Caucasian cohorts and influences clinical outcomes.

39451734,The Impact of Gastrectomy on Inflammatory Bowel Disease Risk in Gastric Cancer Patients: A Critical Analysis.,"Gastrectomy, a prevalent surgical procedure for gastric cancer, results in substantial alterations to the gastrointestinal tract, including reduced gastric acid production and significant modifications to the gut microbiota. These changes can impair postoperative recovery, influence metabolic functions, and predispose patients to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies have shown an increased risk of IBD, particularly Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), in patients following gastrectomy and bariatric surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). For instance, patients undergoing RYGB have a higher hazard ratio for developing CD, while SG patients show an increased risk for UC. The surgical alteration of the gastrointestinal tract promotes dysbiosis, with a significant increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial microbial populations. This dysbiosis can impair the intestinal mucosal barrier and promote systemic inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms behind these changes and their clinical implications is essential for developing effective postoperative management strategies. Probiotics and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have shown promise in mitigating these adverse effects, improving gut microbiota balance, and enhancing patient outcomes. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the long-term impacts of gastrectomy on gastrointestinal health and to refine therapeutic approaches for postoperative care.",Christodoulidis G; Koumarelas KE; Tsagkidou K; Agko ES; Bartzi D; Koumarelas K; Zacharoulis D,2024,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",31,10,5789-5801,10.3390/curroncol31100430,"Christodoulidis, G., Koumarelas, K.

The naissance of chronic inflammation due to the battle of the immune system with the trespassing gut bacteria leads to the rise of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Though the genes behind the scenes and their link to the disease are still unclear, the onset of IBD occurs in young adults and has expanded from the Western world into the newly industrialized countries. Conventional drug deliveries depend on a daily heavy dosage of immune suppressants or anti-inflammatory drugs targeted for the treatment of two types of IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are often associated with systemic side effects and adverse toxicities. Advances in oral delivery through nanotechnology seek remedies to overcome the drawbacks of these conventional drug delivery systems through improved drug encapsulation and targeted delivery. In this review, we discuss the association of genetic factors, the immune system, the gut microbiome, and environmental factors like diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Historically, patients underwent a proctocolectomy with end ileostomy, however, a restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) was introduced in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom and gave patients the opportunity to avoid a permanent stoma. Initially designed as a hand-sewn ""S"" shaped pouch, with the invention of the linear stapler, a ""J"" shaped pouch was described in Japan, and subsequent advances in the United States largely contributed to the pelvic pouch's evolution to the standard of care in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The procedure was then divided into different stages depending on the medical condition of the patient and minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic & robotic surgery) have continued to advance the success of the operation. Unfortunately, pouch complications occur, and seem to be occurring at an increasing frequency with the adoption of minimally invasive surgery. The field of reoperative pouch surgery has emerged to offer patients the opportunity to restore their quality of life (QOL) without the need for a permanent ostomy. Many patients with signs of pouch failure such as pouchitis, fistulae, pain and obstruction are diagnosed with Crohn's of the pouch, but many have mechanical complications that can be corrected with surgery, rather than offering pouch excision with a permanent ostomy (continent or traditional). Patients with Crohn's may be offered an IPAA but they will not have success if they, like patients with UC, have mechanical complications leading to their pouch failure. Patients who undergo reoperative pouch surgery do well with an acceptable QOL.",Cohen D; Silvestri C; Schwartzberg DM,2023,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,8,,27,10.21037/tgh-23-28,"Cohen, D., Silvestri, C., & Schwartzberg, D.

40841786,Main genetic factors associated with inflammatory bowel diseases and their consequences on intestinal permeability: involvement in gut inflammation.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main subtypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD are multifactorial diseases with a complex etiology, involving an intricate interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Since the discovery of NOD2 gene in 2001, genome-wide association studies have reported more than 200 IBD susceptibility loci. The strongest associations highlighted five main pathways as altered in IBD: bacterial sensing (NOD2), autophagy (ATG16L1, IRGM...), endoplasmic reticulum stress (XBP1, ARG2...), Th-17 immune pathway (IL23-receptor), and the vitamin D receptors (VDR). The pathophysiology of IBD results from an abnormal immune response toward an altered gut microbiota. Although the primum movens remains unknown, an increased intestinal permeability is clearly involved in the genesis of this abnormal crosstalk, leading to whole tissue inflammation. Thus, an excessive intestinal permeability, or ""leaky gut"", has been described to precede the development of CD. Moreover, in IBD, intestinal permeability is described to be a sensitive prognostic indicator of relapse in patients with quiescent IBD. Thus, the aim of this review is to highlight the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the main pathways associated with IBD could contribute to alter the intestinal permeability to favour and/or exacerbate chronic inflammation, leading to debilitating diseases.",Mauduit A; Mas E; Solà-Tapias N; Ménard S; Barreau F,2025,Journal of gastroenterology,,,,10.1007/s00535-025-02289-x,"Mauduit, A., Mas, E., Solà-Tapias, N., Ménard, S., & Barreau, F.

40823559,Probiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases: emphasis on mechanisms and clinical application.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of diseases characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In recent years, probiotics have attracted more and more attention as a potential adjuvant therapy. Probiotics can improve the symptoms and quality of life of IBD patients mainly by regulating intestinal microflora, regulating immune response, enhancing intestinal barrier function and exerting anti-inflammatory effect. However, although a large number of studies have explored the role of probiotics, there are still individual differences and uncertainties in clinical application. This paper reviews the mechanism, clinical effect and future prospect of probiotics in the treatment of IBD, and analyzes the existing clinical research and experimental data to provide reference for further research. Finally, this paper looks forward to the research direction of probiotics in the treatment of IBD, aiming at providing evidence for clinical practice.",Zhang J; Zhang X; Cheng X; Wang S; Lv Y; Zheng X; Wu G,2025,Frontiers in medicine,12,,1620079,10.3389/fmed.2025.1620079,"Zhang, J., Zhang, X., Cheng, X., Wang, S., Lv, Y., Zheng, X., & Wu, G.

33214029,Risk of renal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A pooled analysis of population-based studies.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, newer epidemiological studies report the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and risk of renal cancer (RCa). Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether IBD patients were associated with RCa risk.
METHODS: Various medical databases were searched from inception to April 2020. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled. The meta-analysis was completed by STATA version 14.2.
RESULTS: A total of 421 articles were identified, and 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data from 9 cohort studies showed a significantly increased risk of RCa in IBD patients (pooled SIR: 1.53; 95%CI: 1.25-1.80; I2 = 42.4%), especially for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled SIR: 1.95; 95%CI: 1.45-2.44; I2 = 39.9%). We did not observe a significantly increased risk of RCa in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (pooled SIR: 1.31; 95%CI: 0.94-1.67; I2 = 48.0%) when compared to the background population. Only 2 case-control studies reported the results of RCa risk, showing no significant difference between IBD group and IBD-free group (pooled RR: 1.64; 95%CI: 0.52-5.22; I2 = 77.9%).

39463190,Exploring photobiomodulation in the management of bowel diseases: a concise critical review.,"The complexity of the gastrointestinal system plays a crucial role in coordinating essential processes such as digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) pose significant treatment challenges due to their complex aetiology and varied symptoms. Conventional therapeutic approaches often involve pharmacological interventions, which may have side effects and limited efficacy. Photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low-level light therapy, has emerged as a promising therapeutic or adjunctive alternative in the treatment of intestinal diseases. The search was conducted in the MEDLINE database via PubMed, SCOPUS, covering the period from 1990 to 2024. A total of 72 studies were selected, of which 9 focused on inflammatory bowel diseases IBD, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Among these studies, 1 was clinical protocol while eight experimental. The results showed that PBM has a significant positive effect in IBD studies in rats, with reduction of intestinal inflammation, improvement of mucosal integrity, and modulation of the immune response. However, no clinical studies were found necessary to obtain results and establish effective and safe treatment protocols. Nevertheless, PBM holds potential as a non-invasive and complementary therapeutic approach for managing IBD, offering new perspectives for the treatment of chronic intestinal diseases. Therefore, this brief review emphasizes the need to transition from preclinical research to clinical research on this topic and highlights the scarcity of clinical studies.",De Souza V; Cruz MDP; Mello DC; Oliveira APL; Martins RÁBL; Longo L; Parizotto NA; Marcos RL,2024,Lasers in medical science,39,1,265,10.1007/s10103-024-04217-6,"De Souza, V., Cruz, M.

40691419,The role of gastrointestinal PCR in inflammatory bowel disease flares: A double-edged sword or a diagnostic breakthrough?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, leading to unpredictable flares and substantial morbidity. Gastrointestinal polymerase chain reaction (GI-PCR) testing has emerged as a widely used diagnostic tool to identify enteric pathogens during IBD exacerbations. It is a novel, quick and sensitive diagnostic test to detect Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), as well as other enteric pathogens. However, the clinical significance of non-C. difficile pathogens detected by GI-PCR remains uncertain, raising concerns about the over-interpretation of positive results and the potential for unnecessary antimicrobial therapy. While traditional stool culture and microscopy offered limited sensitivity, GI-PCR has dramatically improved pathogen detection rates, identifying infections in up to 26% of IBD patients compared to 5% with conventional methods. Beyond C. difficile, pathogens such as Escherichia coli (especially adherent-invasive strains), Campylobacter, Salmonella, Norovirus and Yersinia enterocolitica are frequently detected in IBD flares. However, whether these microbes actively drive disease exacerbations or merely reflect inflammation-associated dysbiosis remains unclear. Enterobacteriaceae, in particular, bloom in inflamed intestines, raising critical questions regarding their pathogenic role vs. colonization. The high sensitivity of GI-PCR further complicates clinical decision-making, as distinguishing active infection from harmless microbial presence is challenging. This review explores the current literature on GI-PCR in IBD, emphasizing its benefits and limitations. While GI-PCR provides rapid, comprehensive pathogen detection, its indiscriminate application may lead to unnecessary antibiotic use and therapeutic missteps. Understanding the ecological shifts in IBD-associated dysbiosis and refining clinical interpretation of GI-PCR results are essential to optimizing patient management. Future research should aim to delineate the pathogenic significance of non-C. difficile microbes and establish evidence-based protocols for the appropriate use of GI-PCR in IBD care.",Goyal MK; Berinstein E; Dutta P; Ahuja V; Higgins PDR; Berinstein J; Bishu S,2025,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,,,,10.1007/s12664-025-01811-6,"Goyal, M.

38547511,Operating Properties of Disease Activity Indices in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate, reliable, and responsive disease activity indices are important to streamline drug approval and treatment modalities for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD). We aimed to identify all scoring indices used in pIBD randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to evaluate their operating properties.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched on December 6, 2022, to identify studies evaluating clinical, endoscopic, imaging, or patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in pIBD including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Validity, reliability, responsiveness, and feasibility were summarized.
RESULTS: Seventy RCTs evaluating pIBD indices were identified. Forty-one studies reported on the operating properties of 14 eligible indices (n = 9 CD, n = 5 UC). The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) varied widely in terms of validity and reliability and was less feasible overall. In contrast, the Mucosal Inflammation Noninvasive Index, which includes fecal calprotectin, had better operating properties than the PCDAI. The Simplified Endoscopic Mucosal Assessment of Crohn's Disease appears more feasible and had similar operating properties than the longer Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index was feasible, valid, and reliable, but responsiveness needs to be evaluated further. The Endoscopic Mayo score and the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity were reliable, but validity and responsiveness need to be evaluated further. Imaging and PROMs/quality of life indices need further evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: The operating properties of pIBD clinical trial end points varied widely.

35843146,Mendelian randomization study for the roles of IL-18 and IL-1 receptor antagonist in the development of inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: IL-1 and IL-18 play important roles in intestine barrier integrity maintenance and inflammatory response. However, their net effects on the risk of IBD are still inconclusive. Here, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches to investigate the causal associations of IL-18 and IL-1Ra (receptor antagonist) on the risks of IBD and subtypes.
METHODS: For IL-18, both three-sample and two-sample MR approaches were used for the causal inferences. In three-sample MR, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the effect values were extracted from two quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets with non-overlapping populations. In two-sample MR, we extracted genetic instruments information from the same larger pQTL dataset. For IL-1Ra, we applied the two-sample MR method with summary-statistics from the larger pQTL dataset. Summary-level results of three large IBD/CD/UC genome-wide association studies in European ancestry were employed. Inverse-variance weighted method, various sensitivity analyses and meta-analysis were performed to give causal estimates, detect heterogeneity and correct for outliers.
RESULTS: We observed consistent positive causal effects of IL-18 on all three major outcomes using three-sample MR, with meta-analyses odds ratios (ORs) equal to 1.240 (IBD), 1.199 (CD) and 1.274 (UC) respectively. The two-sample MR demonstrated similar results. Moreover, genetically predicted IL-1Ra is inversely associated with the risk of IBD/UC/CD with ORs equal to 0.915 (IBD), 0.902 (CD) and 0.899 (UC) respectively in meta-analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested genetically predicted IL-18 and IL-1Ra level are causally associated with an increased and decreased risk of IBD and subtypes.",Mi J; Liu Z; Pei S; Wu X; Zhao N; Jiang L; Zhang Z; Bai X,2022,International immunopharmacology,110,,109020,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109020,"Mi, J., Liu, Z., Pei, S., Wu, X., Zhao, N., Jiang, L., Zhang, Z., & Bai, X.

38335423,Primary clostridium difficile infection in patients with ulcerative colitis: Case report and literature review.,"RATIONALE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with IBD are susceptible to various complications, including the coexistence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The incidence of IBD combined with difficile infection is higher in patients with compromised immune function, which can lead to increased mortality.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 43-year-old male presented with recurrent episodes of mucus and bloody stools persisting for more than a month without any identifiable triggering factors. Initially, the stool consistency was normal, but it progressively shifted to a loose and watery texture, with up to 8 occurrences daily.
DIAGNOSES: This case underscores the diagnosis of severe UC through colonoscopy and colonic biopsy, along with the supplementary identification of a positive result for Clostridioides difficile in the fecal sample.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient initiated infliximab therapy alongside a full vancomycin course, demonstrating the potential effectiveness of this intervention in managing early-stage ulcerative colitis with concurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.
OUTCOMES: Following the completion of a full vancomycin course, the patient initiated infliximab therapy. The patient was free from significant discomfort, exhibited no fever, and had no mucopurulent bloody stools. A follow-up blood test indicated reduced inflammatory markers compared to the preoperative period, and the stools were normal.
LESSONS: We illustrate the potential effectiveness of this medication by presenting an in-depth case report of a patient with early-stage UC. The report outlines the patient inclusion of infliximab to better manage UC inflammation alongside an adjunct vancomycin regimen, given the ineffectiveness of mesalazine therapy and the concurrent presence of Clostridium difficile infection. This case prompts consideration of therapeutic approaches for complex UC and contributes to advancing both research and clinical practice.

A Meta-Analysis of Data from 61 Million Participants.,"INTRODUCTION: This review aimed to examine if atopic dermatitis (AD) led to an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by collating data from longitudinal studies.
METHODS: Cohort and case-control studies examining the risk of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) due to exposure to AD were included in this review. Articles were searched on PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic repositories up to 2nd October 2024.
RESULTS: Eight retrospective cohort studies with 61,190,816 participants were included. The meta-analysis found that AD was a significant risk factor for IBD (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.43). No statistical heterogeneity was noted. Pooled analysis showed that exposure to AD was a significant risk factor for both CD (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.76) and UC (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.56). Both meta-analyses had high inter-study heterogeneity with I2 = 83% and I2 = 89%, respectively. Results remained significant on sensitivity analysis.

These diseases manifest themselves as chronic, uncontrolled inflammation of the intestines, difficult to control, with periods of spontaneous exacerbations and remissions. Depending on the variety of symptoms present and their location in the human gastrointestinal tract, these diseases can occur in various forms. The most common: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). The underlying cause of activation as well as subsequent development is not clearly defined, but it is known that these disorders are autoimmune.

However, associations between TNFSF15 rs6478109, rs7869487, and rs7865494 polymorphisms and IBD remain unclear.
METHODS: Eligible articles were retrieved from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI databases through 20 March 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the relationships of TNFSF15 polymorphisms with IBD susceptibility.
RESULTS: Under the recessive model, TNFSF15 rs6478109 was associated with IBD risk (OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.92). Stratification analyses based on the type of disease-Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC)-revealed a significant association under the allelic and recessive models between TNFSF15 rs6478109 and CD (allelic model: OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.99; recessive model: OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.87) but not UC.

38183088,Assessing causality between inflammatory bowel diseases with frailty index and sarcopenia: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found that frailty and sarcopenia are commonly diagnosed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, indicating an association between these conditions. Nonetheless, the cause‒effect connection between IBD, frailty, and sarcopenia remains unclear.
METHODS: We sourced the genetic variants for the exposures and outcomes from publicly accessible, extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Specifically, we obtained IBD data from the International IBD Genetics Consortium, frailty index (FI) data from the United Kingdom Biobank and Swedish TwinGene, and sarcopenia data from a recent GWAS meta-analysis. Five methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), simple mode, MR-Egger, weighted mode, and the weighted median, were used to proceed with MR estimates. We also performed heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a positive causal relationship between ulcerative colitis (UC) (IVW: β = 0.014, 95% CI, 0.006 to 0.021, p = 0.001) and Crohn's disease (CD) (IVW: β = 0.012; 95% CI, 0.006 to 0.018, p = 2e-04) with the FI. However, we uncovered no proof of a cause-and-effect relationship between UC (IVW: β = 0.001, 95% CI, -0.015 to 0.017, p = 0.344) or CD (IVW: β = 0.003, 95% CI, -0.009 to 0.015, p = 0.214) and sarcopenia. Additionally, in the inverse order, we also discovered no cause-and-effect connection between FI or sarcopenia on UC or CD in this study.
CONCLUSION: The MR analysis showed a positive causal association between IBD and FI, indicating that IBD patients may exhibit aging-related characteristics. Therefore, frailty assessments should be conducted as early as possible in IBD patients.",Wang P; Tao W; Zhang Z; Xu C; Qiu Y; Xiao W,2024,European journal of medical research,29,1,23,10.1186/s40001-023-01614-5,"Wang, P., Tao, W., Zhang, Z., Xu, C., Qiu, Y., & Xiao, W.

40868118,Pathophysiological Links Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: The Role of Dysbiosis and Emerging Biomarkers.,"This review introduces a novel integrative framework linking gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We highlight emerging biomarkers, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), calprotectin, and zonulin, that reflect alterations in the gut microbiome and increased intestinal permeability, which contribute to cardiovascular pathology. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and recent evidence identifies IBD, encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), as a significant non-traditional risk factor for CVD. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how dysbiosis-driven inflammation in IBD patients exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and atherosclerosis, even in the absence of traditional risk factors. Additionally, we discuss how commonly used IBD therapies may modulate cardiovascular risk. Understanding these multifactorial mechanisms and validating reliable biomarkers are essential for improving cardiovascular risk stratification and guiding targeted prevention strategies in this vulnerable population.",Šantić R; Pavlović N; Kumrić M; Vilović M; Božić J,2025,Biomedicines,13,8,,10.3390/biomedicines13081864,"Šantić, R., Pavlović, N., Kumrić, M., Vilović, M., & Božić, J.

40661220,Artificial intelligence in inflammatory bowel disease endoscopy - a review of current evidence and a critical perspective on future challenges.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated condition with a rising global prevalence. Endoscopic diagnosis, monitoring and surveillance currently depend on individual endoscopists, introducing subjectivity, variability, delays and potential diagnostic discrepancies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform these processes. To date, most AI applications have focused on ulcerative colitis (UC) severity assessment, demonstrating promising results in replicating human evaluation, standardizing severity evaluation and facilitating the application of more complex scoring systems. Research into AI for Crohn's disease (CD) has lagged behind UC, due to challenges such as disease heterogeneity and transmural extension; nevertheless, significant progress has been made to automate capsule endoscopy readings for CD. Beyond the grading of disease severity, AI is also being explored for tasks such as identifying dysplastic lesions, differentiating IBD from other conditions, assessing intestinal barrier permeability, guiding treatment decisions and integrating data from multiple omics, though studies in these areas remain exploratory. This review examines the current landscape of AI applications in IBD endoscopy, summarizes key studies in the field and explores the future potential of AI in IBD care.",Lodola I; D'Amico F; Danese S; Parigi TL,2025,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,18,,17562848251350896,10.1177/17562848251350896,"Lodola, I., D'Amico, F., Danese, S., & Parigi, T.

39642943,The role of urine metabolomics in the diagnosis and management of adult and pediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.,"INTRODUCTION: Urine metabolomics offers a non-invasive approach to diagnose and manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), by identifying distinct metabolic signatures.
OBJECTIVES: This narrative review summarizes current findings on urinary metabolites in IBD, evaluating their roles in disease differentiation, assessment of activity, and monitoring therapeutic response.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE up to October 2023 was conducted using keywords, such as 'urine metabolomics', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'Crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis', and 'urinary biomarkers'. Studies were included that described alterations to metabolic pathways, including those related to the urea cycle, central energy metabolism (Krebs cycle), amino acid metabolism, and neurotransmitters.
RESULTS: Specific urinary metabolites differentiate IBD patients from healthy controls and between CD and UC. Decreased urinary levels of hippurate, acetate, methanol, formate, and methylamine are observed in IBD, indicating altered gut microbiota. In CD patients, urea cycle alterations include reduced urinary urea and ornithine with increased arginine. Changes in Krebs cycle intermediates show decreased citrate and succinate in adults, but increased fumarate and isocitrate in pediatric patients, reflecting energy metabolism differences. Amino acid metabolism differs by age: Adults exhibit decreased urinary asparagine, lysine, and histidine, while pediatric patients show increased methionine, proline, aspartic acid, and isoleucine. Elevated urinary neurotransmitters like dopamine are noted in pediatric IBD patients. Urine metabolomics also can monitor treatment efficacy by distinguishing responders from non-responders to therapies and differentiating active disease from remission.
CONCLUSION: Urine metabolomics provides promising, non-invasive biomarkers to enhance IBD diagnostics by distinguishing CD from UC and offering insights into underlying metabolic disturbances, paving the way for more precise, accessible patient care.",Baskaran K; Moshkovich M; Hart L; Shah N; Chowdhury F; Shanmuganathan M; Britz-McKibbin P; Pai N,2025,"Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",30,1,104-113,10.1080/1354750X.2024.2438734,"Baskaran, K., Moshkovich, M., Hart, L., Shah, N., Chowdhury, F., Shanmuganathan, M., Britz-McKibbin, P., & Pai, N.

40868062,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Gastrointestinal Immune Homeostasis and Inflammation: Implications for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a heterogeneous group of recurring inflammatory conditions of the digestive system that encompass both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), pose a significant public health challenge, currently lacking a definitive cure. The specific etiopathogenesis of IBD is not yet fully understood, but a multifactorial interplay of genetic and environmental factors is suspected. A growing body of evidence supports the involvement of intestinal dysbiosis in the development of IBD, including the effects of dysbiosis on the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier, modulation of the host immune system, alterations in the enteric nervous system, and the perpetuation of chronic inflammation. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is important to define preventive measures, to develop new effective and lasting treatments, and to improve disease outcome. This review examines the complex tri-directional relationship between gut microbiota, mucosal immune system, and intestinal epithelium in IBD. In addition, nonpharmacological and behavioral strategies aimed at restoring a proper microbial-immune relationship will be suggested.",Bretto E; Urpì-Ferreruela M; Casanova GR; González-Suárez B,2025,Biomedicines,13,8,,10.3390/biomedicines13081807,"Bretto, E., Urpì-Ferreruela, M., Casanova, G.

40913942,The role of CT Colonography in the assessment of inflammatory bowel Diseases patients.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, and its long-standing course significantly elevates the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), primarily arising from dysplastic lesions. While regular surveillance by colonoscopy is well established for UC patients, guidelines for CD remain uncertain. Computed Tomographic Colonography (CTC) offers a minimally invasive alternative for evaluating the colon, particularly in cases where colonoscopy is incomplete or contraindicated. Although not commonly utilized in IBD management, CTC provides substantial advantages in identifying complications such as fistulas, strictures, and colonic neoplasms. Additionally, it offers anatomical detail, which is crucial for surgical planning and decision-making. In this review we aim to demonstrate the usefulness of CTC in selected IBD cases, particularly in patients for whom colonoscopy is not feasible, and to show how its integration into clinical practice enhances decision-making and provides crucial insights into disease complications.",Leonardo M; Francesco C; Sarah M; Gloria Z; Piergiorgio D; Giovanni M; Andrea I; Nicola F,2025,European journal of radiology,192,,112397,10.1016/j.ejrad.2025.112397,"Leonardo, M., Francesco, C., Sarah, M., Gloria, Z., Piergiorgio, D., Giovanni, M., Andrea, I., & Nicola, F.

31286804,"New insights into the interplay between autophagy, gut microbiota and inflammatory responses in IBD.","One of the most significant challenges of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research is to understand how alterations in the symbiotic relationship between the genetic composition of the host and the intestinal microbiota, under impact of specific environmental factors, lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using in vitro and in vivo models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for disease management.Abbreviations: AIEC: adherent-invasive Escherichia coli; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; ATG: autophagy related; Atg16l1[ΔIEC] mice: mice with Atg16l1 depletion specifically in intestinal epithelial cells; Atg16l1[HM] mice: mice hypomorphic for Atg16l1 expression; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CALCOCO2: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CASP: caspase; CD: Crohn disease; CGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; CHUK/IKKA: conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase; CLDN2: claudin 2; DAPK1: death associated protein kinase 1; DCs: dendritic cells; DSS: dextran sulfate sodium; EIF2A: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A; EIF2AK: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERBIN: Erbb2 interacting protein; ERN1/IRE1A: ER to nucleus signaling 1; FNBP1L: formin binding protein 1-like; FOXP3: forkhead box P3; GPR65: G-protein coupled receptor 65; GSK3B: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; IECs: intestinal epithelial cells; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; IL10R: interleukin 10 receptor; IRGM: immunity related GTPase M; ISC: intestinal stem cell; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LRRK2: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MIF: macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MIR/miRNA: microRNA; MTMR3: myotubularin related protein 3; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MYD88: myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; NLRP3: NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; NOD2: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2; NPC: Niemann-Pick disease type C; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; OMVs: outer membrane vesicles; OPTN: optineurin; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PRR: pattern-recognition receptor; PTPN2: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2; PTPN22: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid); PYCARD/ASC: PYD and CARD domain containing; RAB2A: RAB2A, member RAS oncogene family; RELA: v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (avian); RIPK2: receptor (TNFRSF)-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SNPs: single nucleotide polymorphisms; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; Th: T helper 1; TIRAP/TRIF: toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein; TLR: toll-like receptor; TMEM173/STING: transmembrane protein 173; TMEM59: transmembrane protein 59; TNF/TNFA: tumor necrosis factor; Treg: regulatory T; TREM1: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; UC: ulcerative colitis; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild-type; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1; XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.",Larabi A; Barnich N; Nguyen HTT,2020,Autophagy,16,1,38-51,10.1080/15548627.2019.1635384,"Larabi, A., Barnich, N., & Nguyen, H.

33906557,How autophagy controls the intestinal epithelial barrier.,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that results in lysosome-mediated recycling of organelles and protein aggregates, as well as the destruction of intracellular pathogens. Its role in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium is of particular interest, as several autophagy-related genes have been associated with intestinal disease. Autophagy and its regulatory mechanisms are involved in both homeostasis and repair of the intestine, supporting intestinal barrier function in response to cellular stress through tight junction regulation and protection from cell death. Furthermore, a clear role has emerged for autophagy not only in secretory cells but also in intestinal stem cells, where it affects their metabolism, as well as their proliferative and regenerative capacity. Here, we review the physiological role of autophagy in the context of intestinal epithelial maintenance and how genetic mutations affecting autophagy contribute to the development of intestinal disease.Abbreviations: AKT1S1: AKT1 substrate 1; AMBRA1: autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; APC: APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; ATG: autophagy related; atg16l1[ΔIEC] mice: mice with a specific deletion of Atg16l1 in intestinal epithelial cells; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BECN1: beclin 1; bsk/Jnk: basket; CADPR: cyclic ADP ribose; CALCOCO2: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CASP3: caspase 3; CD: Crohn disease; CDH1/E-cadherin: cadherin 1; CF: cystic fibrosis; CFTR: CF transmembrane conductance regulator; CGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; CLDN2: claudin 2; CoPEC: colibactin-producing E. coli; CRC: colorectal cancer; CYP1A1: cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1; DC: dendritic cell; DDIT3: DNA damage inducible transcript 3; DEPTOR: DEP domain containing MTOR interacting protein; DSS: dextran sulfate sodium; EGF: epidermal growth factor; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EIF2A: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A; EIF2AK3: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; EIF2AK4/GCN2: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERN1: endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; HMGB1: high mobility group box 1; HSPA5/GRP78: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; IEC: intestinal epithelial cell; IFN: interferon; IFNG/IFNγ:interferon gamma; IL: interleukin; IRGM: immunity related GTPase M; ISC: intestinal stem cell; LGR5: leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5; LRRK2: leucine rich repeat kinase 2; MAP1LC3A/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha; MAPK/JNK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPK14/p38 MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; MAPKAP1: MAPK associated protein 1; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; miRNA: microRNA; MLKL: mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase; MLST8: MTOR associated protein, LST8 homolog; MNV: murine norovirus; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; NLRP: NLR family pyrin domain containing; NOD: nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing; NRBF2: nuclear receptor binding factor 2; OPTN: optineurin; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; P: phosphorylation; Patj: PATJ crumbs cell polarity complex component; PE: phosphatidyl-ethanolamine; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PIK3R4: phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 4; PPARG: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; PRR5: proline rich 5; PRR5L: proline rich 5 like; PtdIns3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; RB1CC1/FIP200: RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1; RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum; RHEB: Ras homolog, MTORC1 binding; RICTOR: RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2; RIPK1: receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RPTOR: regulatory associated protein of MTOR complex 1; RPS6KB1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SH3GLB1: SH3 domain containing GRB2 like, endophilin B1; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphism; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; STING1: stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1; TA: transit-amplifying; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TFE3: transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3; TGM2: transglutaminase 2; TJ: tight junction; TJP1/ZO1: tight junction protein 1; TNBS: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid; TNF/TNFα: tumor necrosis factor; Tor: target of rapamycin; TRAF: TNF receptor associated factor; TRIM11: tripartite motif containing 11; TRP53: transformation related protein 53; TSC: TSC complex subunit; Ub: ubiquitin; UC: ulcerative colitis; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; USO1/p115: USO1 vesicle transport factor; UVRAG: UV radiation resistance associated; WIPI: WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting; WNT: WNT family member; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1; ZFYVE1/DFCP1: zinc finger FYVE-type containing 1.",Foerster EG; Mukherjee T; Cabral-Fernandes L; Rocha JDB; Girardin SE; Philpott DJ,2022,Autophagy,18,1,86-103,10.1080/15548627.2021.1909406,"Foerster, E.

37108339,Intestinal Microbiota and miRNA in IBD: A Narrative Review about Discoveries and Perspectives for the Future.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and comprises a chronic gastrointestinal tract disorder characterized by hyperactive and dysregulated immune responses to environmental factors, including gut microbiota and dietary components. An imbalance of the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development and/or worsening of the inflammatory process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with various physiological processes, such as cell development and proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer. In addition, they play an important role in inflammatory processes, acting in the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. Differences in the profiles of miRNAs may represent a useful tool in the diagnosis of UC and CD and as a prognostic marker in both diseases. The relationship between miRNAs and the intestinal microbiota is not completely elucidated, but recently this topic has gained prominence and has become the target of several studies that demonstrate the role of miRNAs in the modulation of the intestinal microbiota and induction of dysbiosis; the microbiota, in turn, can regulate the expression of miRNAs and, consequently, alter the intestinal homeostasis.

35443818,MicroRNAs as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical importance of aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been well established, so was investigated in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Articles in online databases from inception to March 17, 2021 were retrieved. Random effects meta-analysis was used to obtain sensitivity, specificity, positive (PLRs) and negative likelihood ratios (NLRs), diagnostic odds ratios (DORs), and areas under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for IBD diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of 117 studies reporting altered miRNA expression in IBD included in the systematic review, 15 involving 937 patients with IBD and 707 controls, 22 miRNAs, and two miRNA panels were eligible for meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed a moderate diagnostic accuracy for miRNAs in the IBD diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.82), specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86), DOR of 21.19 (95% CI: 13.90-32.31), and AUC of 0.89. Subgroup analyses revealed a better performance in patients with ulcerative colitis (AUC, 0.93) than Crohn's disease (AUC, 0.84).

36545755,Deep Dive Into MicroRNAs in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is thought to develop in genetically predisposed individuals as a consequence of complex interactions between dysregulated inflammatory stimuli, immunological responses, and environmental factors. The pathogenesis of IBD has yet to be fully understood. The global increase in the incidence of IBD suggests a gap in the current understanding of the disease. The development of a new diagnostic tool for inflammatory bowel disease that is both less invasive and more cost-effective would allow for better management of this condition. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs with important roles as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, which has led to new insights into understanding IBD. Using techniques such as microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reactions, researchers have investigated the patterns in which patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show alterations in the expression of miRNA in tissue, blood, and feces. These miRNAs are found to be differentially expressed in IBD and implicated in its pathogenesis through alterations in autophagy, intestinal barrier, and immune homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the miRNA expression profiles associated with IBD in tissue, peripheral blood, and feces and provide an overview of the miRNA mechanisms involved in IBD.",Alfaifi J; Germain A; Heba AC; Arnone D; Gailly L; Ndiaye NC; Viennois E; Caron B; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Dreumont N,2023,Inflammatory bowel diseases,29,6,986-999,10.1093/ibd/izac250,"Alfaifi, J., Germain, A., Heba, A.

One major player is microRNA (miRNA), which is found to be associated with multiple pathways in mediating inflammation, especially those of a chronic nature in IBD, as well as irritable bowel syndrome. Although there have been studies linking miRNA alterations in IBD, even differentiating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, this review focuses mainly on how miRNAs cause and mechanistically influence the pathologic complications of IBD. In addition to its role in the well-known progression towards colorectal cancer, we also emphasize how miRNA manifests the many extraintestinal complications in IBD such as cardiovascular diseases; neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders; and others, including various musculoskeletal, dermatologic, ocular, and hepatobiliary complications. We conclude through a description of its potential use in bettering diagnostics and the future treatment of IBD and its systemic symptoms.",Krishnachaitanya SS; Liu M; Fujise K; Li Q,2022,International journal of molecular sciences,23,15,,10.3390/ijms23158751,"Krishnachaitanya, S.

Although IBD has been extensively studied for decades, its cause and pathogenesis remain unclear. Existing research suggests that IBD may be the result of an interaction between genetic factors, environmental factors and the gut microbiome. IBD is closely related to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). NcRNAs are composed of microRNA(miRNA), long non-coding RNA(lnc RNA) and circular RNA(circ RNA). Compared with miRNA, the role of lnc RNA in IBD has been little studied. Lnc RNA is an RNA molecule that regulates gene expression and regulates a variety of molecular pathways involved in the pathbiology of IBD. Targeting IBD-associated lnc RNAs may promote personalized treatment of IBD and have therapeutic value for IBD patients. Therefore, this review summarized the effects of lnc RNA on the intestinal epithelial barrier, inflammatory response and immune homeostasis in IBD, and summarized the potential of lnc RNA as a biomarker of IBD and as a predictor of therapeutic response to IBD in the future.",Hu Y; Lu Y; Fang Y; Zhang Q; Zheng Z; Zheng X; Ye X; Chen Y; Ding J; Yang J,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1406538,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1406538,"Hu, Y., Lu, Y., Fang, Y., Zhang, Q., Zheng, Z., Zheng, X., Ye, X., Chen, Y., Ding, J., & Yang, J.

Recently, several studies have assessed the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated neoplasia. Particularly, it has been shown that many members of miRNAs family are involved in the pathways of inflammation and fibrogenesis of IBD; therefore, their use as inflammatory and fibrosis biomarkers has been postulated. In light of these results, the role of miRNAs in IBD therapy has been proposed and is currently under investigation with many in vitro and in vivo studies, murine models, and a phase 2a trial. The accumulating data have pushed miRNA-based therapy closer to clinical practice, although many open questions remain.

Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA or microRNA), single-stranded noncoding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides, have been considered as the potential therapeutic targets in the pathogenesis of IBD. Many previous studies have focused on the mechanisms that miRNAs use to regulate inflammation, immunity, and microorganisms in IBD. The review highlights in detail the findings of miRNAs in the intestinal epithelial barrier of IBD, and focuses on their gene targets, signaling pathways associated with IBD, and some potential therapies.

This review summarizes current knowledge of differentially expressed miRNAs in mucosal tissues and peripheral blood of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We combined comprehensive literature curation with computational meta-analysis of publicly available high-throughput datasets to obtain a consensus set of miRNAs consistently differentially expressed in mucosal tissues.

36385416,Updated immunomodulatory roles of gut flora and microRNAs in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel disease is a heterogeneous intestinal inflammatory disorder, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Existing studies have shown that the pathogenesis of IBD is closely related to the host's genetic susceptibility, intestinal flora disturbance and mucosal immune abnormalities, etc. It is generally believed that there are complicated interactions between host immunity and intestinal microflora/microRNAs during the occurrence and progression of IBD. Intestinal flora is mainly composed of bacteria, fungi, viruses and helminths. These commensals are highly implicated in the maintenance of intestinal microenvironment homeostasis alone or in combination. MiRNA is an endogenous non-coding small RNA with a length of 20 to 22 nucleotides, which can perform a variety of biological functions by silencing or activating target genes through complementary pairing bonds. A large quantity of miRNAs are involved in intestinal inflammation, mucosal barrier integrity, autophagy, vesicle transportation and other small RNA alterations in IBD circumstance. In this review, the immunomodulatory roles of gut flora and microRNAs are updated in the occurrence and progression of IBD. Meanwhile, the gut flora and microRNA targeted therapeutic strategies as well as other immunomodulatory approaches including TNF-α monoclonal antibodies are also emphasized in the treatment of IBD.",Cheng T; Xu C; Shao J,2023,Clinical and experimental medicine,23,4,1015-1031,10.1007/s10238-022-00935-9,"Cheng, T., Xu, C., & Shao, J.

38156400,Exploring the theranostic potentials of miRNA and epigenetic networks in autoimmune diseases: A comprehensive review.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune diseases (AD) are severe pathophysiological ailments that are stimulated by an exaggerated immunogenic response towards self-antigens, which can cause systemic or site-specific organ damage. An array of complex genetic and epigenetic facets majorly contributes to the progression of AD, thus providing significant insight into the regulatory mechanism of microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that have been identified as essential contributors to the post-transcriptional regulation of host genome expression and as crucial regulators of a myriad of biological processes such as immune homeostasis, T helper cell differentiation, central and peripheral tolerance, and immune cell development.
AIMS: This article tends to deliberate and conceptualize the brief pathogenesis and pertinent epigenetic regulatory mechanism as well as miRNA networks majorly affecting five different ADs namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) thereby providing novel miRNA-based theranostic interventions.
RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Pertaining to the differential expression of miRNA attributed in target tissues and cellular bodies of innate and adaptive immunity, a paradigm of scientific expeditions suggests an optimistic correlation between immunogenic dysfunction and miRNA alterations.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is not astonishing that dysregulations in miRNA expression patterns are now recognized in a wide spectrum of disorders, establishing themselves as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

36111766,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Current State of the Art.,"The human microbiome comprises the genomes of the microbiota that live on and within humans, such as protozoa, archaea, eukaryotes, viruses, and most bacteria. Gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome can all be triggered by a change in gut flora. The alteration of the gut microbiota (also known as ""gut dysbiosis"") is affected by host genetics, nutrition, antibiotics, and inflammation, and it is associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Also, intestinal epithelial dysfunction, altered autophagy, and immune hyperactivation are frequently detected in individuals with severe IBD, which may be attributed to impaired miRNA expression functions. While the exact mechanisms of how Gut Microbiota may cause IBD and intestinal epithelial dysfunction are still debated, recent data point toward the possibility that hormones, gender and miRNAs expression are modifiable contributors to IBD. This review summarizes the current evidence for an association between hormones, gender and miRNAs and Gut Microbiota in IBD and discusses potential mechanisms by which gut microbiota may impact IBD. The study also outlines critical unanswered topics that need to be solved to enhance IBD prevention and treatment in people with gut dysbiosis.",Askari H; Shojaei-Zarghani S; Raeis-Abdollahi E; Jahromi HK; Abdullahi PR; Daliri K; Tajbakhsh A; Rahmati L; Safarpour AR,2023,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,23,13,1376-1389,10.2174/1389557522666220914093331,"Askari, H., Shojaei-Zarghani, S., Raeis-Abdollahi, E., Jahromi, H.

IBD, represented by ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is one of the most prevalent tumors in the world, and its main risk factors are obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, alcoholism, advanced age, and some eating habits, in addition to chronic intestinal inflammatory processes and the use of immunosuppressants administered to IBD patients. Recent studies have identified miRNAs associated with an increased risk of developing CRC in this population. The identification of miRNAs involved in this tumorigenic process could be useful to stratify cancer risk development for patients with IBD and to monitor and assess prognosis. Thus, the present review aimed to summarize the role of miRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of IBD-associated CRC. In the future, therapies based on miRNA modulation could be used both in clinical practice to achieve remission of the disease and restore the quality of life for patients with IBD, and to identify the patients with IBD at high risk for tumor development.",Grillo TG; Quaglio AEV; Beraldo RF; Lima TB; Baima JP; Di Stasi LC; Sassaki LY,2021,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,13,9,995-1016,10.4251/wjgo.v13.i9.995,"Grillo, T.

Environmental factors, genetics, intestinal microbiota, and the immune system are all involved in the pathophysiology of IBD. Lately, accumulating evidence has shown that abnormal epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, histone markers, and non-coding RNA expression greatly contribute to the development of the entire disease. Epigenetics regulates many functions, such as maintaining the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium and regulating the immune system of the immune cells. In the present study, we systematically summarized the latest advances in epigenetic modification of IBD and how epigenetics reveals new mechanisms of IBD.

These are chronic autoimmune diseases of unknown etiology affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The IBD population includes a heterogeneous group of patients with varying disease courses requiring personalized treatment protocols. The complexity of the disease often delays the diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate treatments. In a subset of patients, IBD leads to colitis-associated cancer (CAC). MicroRNAs are single-stranded regulatory noncoding RNAs of 18 to 22 nucleotides with putative roles in the pathogenesis of IBD and colorectal cancer. They have been explored as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Both tissue-derived and circulating microRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers in the differential diagnosis and in the prognosis of disease severity of IBD as well as predictive biomarkers in drug resistance. In addition, knowledge of the cellular localization of differentially expressed microRNAs is a prerequisite for deciphering the biological role of these important epigenetic regulators and the cellular localization may even contribute to an alternative repertoire of biomarkers.

38186999,Exosome-mediated macrophage regulation for inflammatory bowel disease repair: a potential target of gut inflammation.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a complex condition without a definite cause. During IBD, immune cells such as macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, contributing to intestinal barrier integrity dysfunction. IBD is largely influenced by macrophages, which are classified into subtypes M1 and M2. M1 macrophages have been found to contribute to the development of IBD, whereas M2 macrophages alleviate IBD. Hence, agents that cause increased polarization of the M2 phenotype could help repair IBD. Exosomes, as ubiquitous conveyors of intercellular messages, are involved in immune responses and immune-mediated disease processes. Exosomes and their microRNA (miRNA) from healthy cells have been found to polarize macrophages to M2 to repair IBD due to their anti-inflammatory properties; however, those from inflammatory-driven cells and disease cells promote M1 macrophages to perpetuate IBD. Here, we review the biogenesis, biochemical composition, and sources of exosomes, as well as the roles of exosomes as extracellular vesicles in regulation of macrophages to repair IBD.",Ma F; Zhang S; Akanyibah FA; Zhang W; Chen K; Ocansey DKW; Lyu C; Mao F,2023,American journal of translational research,15,12,6970-6987,,"Ma, F., Zhang, S., Akanyibah, F.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which primarily include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are characterized by chronic recurrent inflammation of intestinal tissues. Due to the multifactorial etiology of these diseases, the development of innovative treatment strategies that can effectively maintain remission and alleviate disease symptoms is a major challenge. In recent years, evidence for the regulatory role of miRNAs in the pathogenetic mechanisms of various diseases, including IBD, has been accumulating. In light of these findings, miRNAs represent potential innovative candidates for therapeutic application in IBD. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the role of miRNAs in regulating inflammatory responses, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, and developing fibrosis in clinical and experimental IBD. The focus is on the existing literature, indicating potential therapeutic application of miRNAs in both preclinical experimental IBD models and translational data in the context of clinical IBD.

33026230,Role and mechanisms of exosomal miRNAs in IBD pathophysiology.,"Exosomes represent secretory membranous vesicles used for the information exchange between cells and organ-to-organ communication. Exosome crosstalk mechanisms are involved in the regulation of several inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated pathophysiological intestinal processes such as barrier function, immune responses, and intestinal flora. Functional biomolecules, mainly noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), are believed to be transmitted between the mammalian cells via exosomes that likely play important roles in cell-to-cell communication, both locally and systemically. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated in exosomes have generated substantial interest because of their critical roles in multiple pathophysiological processes. In addition, exosomal miRNAs are implicated in the gut health. MiRNAs are selectively and actively loaded into the exosomes and then transferred to the target recipient cell where they manipulate cell function through posttranscriptional silencing of target genes. Intriguingly, miRNA profile of exosomes differs from their cellular counterparts suggesting an active sorting and packaging mechanism of exosomal miRNAs. Even more exciting is the involvement of posttranscriptional modifications in the specific loading of miRNAs into exosomes, but the underlying mechanisms of how these modifications direct ncRNA sorting have not been established.

Role of microRNAs in intestinal barrier function.,"Defective intestinal tight-junction (TJ) barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and other inflammatory conditions of the gut. The role of microRNAs (miRNA's or miR's) has also been demonstrated in the last two decades in the pathogenesis of IBD and in the regulation of intestinal TJ barrier function. MiRNAs are noncoding regulators of gene expression at the posttranscription level that have an essential role in targeting transcripts encoding proteins of intestinal TJs and their regulators. Many miRNAs have been reported to regulate or deregulate the TJ proteins responsible for the intestinal barrier integrity and intestinal permeability. Many of those miRNAs have been reported to have essential roles in the pathogenesis of IBD. In this mini-review, we summarize the results of studies in the last three years that implicate miRNAs in the defective TJ barrier in relation to IBD. The therapeutic potential of using specific miRNAs to target the intestinal TJ barrier might be of great insight for IBD therapy.",Al-Sadi R; Engers J; Abdulqadir R,2020,American journal of physiology.

32545207,Review: Local Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Inhibition in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by intestinal inflammation. Increased intestinal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are associated with disease activity and severity. Anti-TNF-α therapy is administered systemically and efficacious in the treatment of IBD. However, systemic exposure is associated with adverse events that may impede therapeutic treatment. Clinical studies show that the efficacy correlates with immunological effects localized in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) as opposed to systemic effects. These data suggest that site-specific TNF-α inhibition in IBD may be efficacious with fewer expected side effects related to systemic exposure. We therefore reviewed the available literature that investigated the efficacy or feasibility of local TNF-α inhibition in IBD. A literature search was performed on PubMed with given search terms and strategy. Of 8739 hits, 48 citations were included in this review. These studies ranged from animal studies to randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. In these studies, local anti-TNF-α therapy was achieved with antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and genetically modified organisms. This narrative review summarizes and discusses these approaches in view of the clinical relevance of local TNF-α inhibition in IBD.",Gareb B; Otten AT; Frijlink HW; Dijkstra G; Kosterink JGW,2020,Pharmaceutics,12,6,,10.3390/pharmaceutics12060539,"Gareb, B., Otten, A.

32901590,Role of Inflammation in the Development of Colorectal Cancer.,"Chronic inflammation can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that includes both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohnmp's disease (CD) are risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Many cytokines produced primarily by the gut immune cells either during or in response to localized inflammation in the colon and rectum are known to stimulate the complex interactions between the different cell types in the gut environment resulting in acute inflammation. Subsequently, chronic inflammation, together with genetic and epigenetic changes, have been shown to lead to the development and progression of CRC. Various cell types present in the colon, such as enterocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells, and macrophages, express receptors for inflammatory cytokines and respond to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and other cytokines. Among the several cytokines produced, TNF-α and IL-1β are the key pro-inflammatory molecules that play critical roles in the development of CRC. The current review is intended to consolidate the published findings to focus on the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-α and IL-1β, on inflammation (and the altered immune response) in the gut, to better understand the development of CRC in IBD, using various experimental model systems, preclinical and clinical studies. Moreover, this review also highlights the current therapeutic strategies available (monotherapy and combination therapy) to alleviate the symptoms or treat inflammation-associated CRC by using monoclonal antibodies or aptamers to block pro-inflammatory molecules, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases in the inflammatory signaling cascade, competitive inhibitors of pro-inflammatory molecules, and the nucleic acid drugs like small activating RNAs (saRNAs) or microRNA (miRNA) mimics to activate tumor suppressor or repress oncogene/pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression.",Muthusami S; Ramachandran IK; Babu KN; Krishnamoorthy S; Guruswamy A; Queimado L; Chaudhuri G; Ramachandran I,2021,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",21,1,77-90,10.2174/1871530320666200909092908,"Muthusami, S., Ramachandran, I.

Unfortunately, IBD patients' quality of life is negatively impacted by the symptoms associated with the disease. The exact etiology of IBD pathogenesis is not fully understood, but the emerging research indicated that the microRNA (miRNA) plays an important role. miRNAs have been documented to possess a significant role in regulating pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, in addition to their roles in several physiological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Variations in the miRNA profiles might be a helpful prognostic indicator and a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis of IBD. Most interestingly, these miRNAs have a promising therapeutic target in several pre-clinical animal studies and phase 2 clinical studies to alleviate inflammation and improve patient's quality of life. This comprehensive review discusses the current knowledge about the significant physiological role of different miRNAs in the health of the intestinal immune system and addresses the role of the most relevant differentially expressed miRNAs in IBD, identify their potential targets, and emphasize their diagnostic and therapeutic potential for future research.",Ramadan YN; Kamel AM; Medhat MA; Hetta HF,2024,Clinical and experimental medicine,24,1,217,10.1007/s10238-024-01476-z,"Ramadan, Y.

37499519,Exploring the impact of miR-128 in inflammatory diseases: A comprehensive study on autoimmune diseases.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in various biological processes, including immune system regulation, such as cell proliferation, tolerance (central and peripheral), and T helper cell development. Dysregulation of miRNA expression and activity can disrupt immune responses and increase susceptibility to neuroimmune disorders. Conversely, miRNAs have been shown to have a protective role in modulating immune responses and preventing autoimmunity. Specifically, reducing the expression of miRNA-128 (miR-128) in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model has been found to improve cognitive deficits and reduce neuropathology. This comprehensive review focuses on the significance of miR-128 in the pathogenesis of neuroautoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), epilepsy, as well as other immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, we present compelling evidence supporting the potential use of miR-128 as a diagnostic or therapeutic biomarker for neuroimmune disorders. Collectively, the available literature suggests that targeting miR-128 could be a promising strategy to alleviate the behavioral symptoms associated with neuroimmune diseases.

32940190,Regulation of MicroRNAs in Inflammation-Associated Colorectal Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.,"The development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multistage process. The inflammation of the colon as in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) is often regarded as the initial trigger for the development of inflammation-associated CRC. Many cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (ILs) are known to exert proinflammatory actions, and inflammation initiates or promotes tumorigenesis of various cancers, including CRC, through differential regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs). miRNAs can be oncogenic miRNAs (oncomiRs) or anti-oncomiRs/tumor suppressor miRNAs, and they play key roles during colorectal carcinogenesis. However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of regulation of miRNAs involved in inflammation-associated CRC are still anecdotal and largely unknown. Consolidating the published results and offering perspective solutions to circumvent CRC, the current review is focused on the role of miRNAs and their regulation in the development of CRC. We have also discussed the model systems adapted by researchers to delineate the role of miRNAs in inflammation-associated CRC.",Muthusami S; Ramachandran I; Krishnamoorthy S; Sambandam Y; Ramalingam S; Queimado L; Chaudhuri G; Ramachandran IK,2021,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",21,1,67-76,10.2174/1871530320666200917112802,"Muthusami, S., Ramachandran, I., Krishnamoorthy, S., Sambandam, Y., Ramalingam, S., Queimado, L., Chaudhuri, G., & Ramachandran, I.

While most researchers study miRNA's role as a biomarker, for example, to distinguish between various sub-forms or stages of a given disease of interest, research is also ongoing to utilize these small nucleic acids as therapeutics. An example of a common pleiotropic disease that could benefit from miRNA-based therapeutics is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small and large intestines. Due to complex interactions between multiple factors in the etiology of IBD, development of therapies that effectively maintain remission for this disease is a significant challenge. In this review, we discuss the role of dysregulated miRNA expression in the context of clinical ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)-the two main forms of IBD-and the various preclinical mouse models of IBD utilized to validate the therapeutic potential of targeting these miRNA. Additionally, we highlight advances in the development of genetically engineered animal models that recapitulate clinical miRNA expression and provide powerful preclinical models to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic promise of miRNA in IBD.",Suri K; Bubier JA; Wiles MV; Shultz LD; Amiji MM; Hosur V,2021,Cells,10,9,,10.3390/cells10092204,"Suri, K., Bubier, J.

40562987,Mechanistic insights into periodontal ligament stem cell-derived exosomes in tissue regeneration.,"OBJECTIVE: This review comprehensively examined the emerging role of exosomes derived from periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC-Exos) in regenerative medicine and dentistry, with a particular focus on their therapeutic potential in periodontitis-a prevalent inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive destruction of periodontal tissues.
METHODS: An initial search on Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed using terms associated with exosomes (i.e., exosomes, exosomal, extracellular vesicles, and EVs) and periodontal ligament stem cells without any limitation of publication year and field of study was performed on October 31st, 2024.
RESULTS: PDLSC-Exos demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in both bone and periodontal regeneration as well as various medical conditions through the enhancement of cellular proliferation, osteoblast differentiation, and the modulation of inflammatory responses. These exosomes function by regulating miRNA and activating essential signaling pathways, thereby facilitating periodontal/bone regeneration, angiogenesis, and tissue repair in disorders such as periodontitis, OTM, and skeletal bony defects. Furthermore, they exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, leading to improved outcomes under inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis, IBD, and MS. Moreover, PDLSC-Exos played a role in anti-microbial and anti-cancer interventions, demonstrating their diverse applicability.
CONCLUSION: The cell-free nature of these therapeutic agents makes PDLSC-Exos a versatile and promising tool for regenerative medicine and immune system regulation. The cell-free nature of these therapeutic agents positions PDLSC-Exos as a promising and adaptable instrument for regenerative medicine and immune system modulation.

Numerous products derived from plant sources have been shown to exert antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects. Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) are natural nanocarriers containing lipids, protein, DNA and microRNA (miRNA) with the ability to enter mammalian cells and regulate cellular activity. PDVLNs have significant potential in immunomodulation of macrophages, along with regulation of intestinal microorganisms and friendly antioxidant activity, as well as overcoming drug resistance. PDVLNs have utility as effective drug carriers and potential modification, with improved drug stability. Since immune function, intestinal microorganisms, and antioxidative stress are commonly targeted key phenomena in the treatment of IBD and CAC, PDVLNs offer a novel therapeutic tool. This review provides a summary of the latest advances in research on the sources and extraction methods, applications and mechanisms in IBD and CAC therapy, overcoming drug resistance, safety, stability, and clinical application of PDVLNs.

34224949,"The pathogenic, therapeutic and diagnostic role of exosomal microRNA in the autoimmune diseases.","Exosomes are a nano-vesicle surrounded by a bilipid layer that can release from almost all cells and could be detected in tissues and biological liquids. These vesicles contain lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (including DNA, mRNA, and miRNA) inside and on the exosomes' surface constitute their content. Exosomes can transfer their cargo into the recipient cell, which can modify recipient cells' biological activities. Recently it has been deciphering that the miRNA pattern of exosomes reveals the cellular pathophysiological situation and modifies various biological processes. Increasing data regarding exosomes highlights that the exosomes and their cargo, especially miRNAs, are implicated in the pathophysiology of various disorders, such as autoimmune disease. The current evidence on the deciphering of mechanisms in which exosomal miRNAs contributed to autoimmunity was indicated that exosomal miRNA might hold information that can reprogram the function of many of the immune cells involved in autoimmune diseases' pathogenesis.

34918052,MicroRNA and Gut Microbiota: Tiny but Mighty-Novel Insights into Their Cross-talk in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Pathogenesis and Therapeutics.,"MicroRNAs [miRNAs], small non-coding RNAs, have recently been described as crucial contributors to intestinal homeostasis. They can interact with the gut microbiota in a reciprocal manner and deeply affect host health status, leading to several disorders when unbalanced. Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that co-occurs with alterations of the gut microbiota, and whose aetiology remains largely unclear. On one hand, host miRNA could be playing a relevant role in IBD pathophysiology by shaping the gut microbiota. The gut microbiome, on the other hand, may regulate the expression of host miRNAs, resulting in intestinal epithelial dysfunction, altered autophagy, and immune hyperactivation. Interestingly, it has been hypothesised that their reciprocal impact may be used for therapeutic goals. This review describes the latest research and suggests mechanisms through which miRNA and intestinal microbiota, as joint actors, may participate specifically in IBD pathophysiology. Furthermore, we discuss the diagnostic power and therapeutic potential resulting from their bidirectional communication after faecal transplantation, probiotics intake, or anti-miRNAs or miRNA mimics administration.

These are autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract with a chronic relapsing and remitting course. Due to complex interactions between multiple factors in the etiology of IBD, the discovery of new predictors of disease course and response to therapy, and the development of effective therapies is a significant challenge. The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of conserved endogenous, small non-coding RNA molecules with a length of 18-25 nucleotides, that regulate gene expression by an RNA interference process, is implicated in the complex pathogenetic context of IBD. Both tissue-derived, circulating, and fecal microRNAs have been explored as promising biomarkers in the diagnosis and the prognosis of disease severity of IBD. In this review, we summarize the expressed miRNA profile in blood, mucosal tissue, and stool and highlight the role of miRNAs as biomarkers with potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

IBDs, encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are multifactorial disorders characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. On the other hand, IBS is one of the principal gastrointestinal tract functional disorders and is characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Although the precise etiopathogenesis of these disorders remains unclear, mounting evidence suggests that non-coding RNA molecules play crucial roles in regulating gene expression associated with inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and tissue permeability, thus influencing disease progression. miRNAs have emerged as possible reliable biomarkers, as they can be analyzed in the biological fluids of patients at a low cost. This review explores the roles of miRNAs in IBDs and IBS, focusing on their involvement in the control of disease hallmarks. By an extensive literature review and employing bioinformatics tools, we identified the miRNAs frequently studied concerning these diseases. Ultimately, specific miRNAs could be proposed as diagnostic biomarkers for IBDs and IBS. Their ability to be secreted into biofluids makes them promising candidates for non-invasive diagnostic tools. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms through the ways in which they regulate gastrointestinal inflammation and immune responses could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of IBDs and IBS and open avenues for miRNA-based therapeutic interventions.",Giammona A; Galuzzi BG; Imperia E; Gervasoni C; Remedia S; Restaneo L; Nespoli M; De Gara L; Tani F; Cicala M; Guarino MPL; Porro D; Cerasa A; Lo Dico A; Altomare A; Bertoli G,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,1,,10.3390/ijms26010413,"Giammona, A., Galuzzi, B.

35309327,Dysregulation of Survivin-Targeting microRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases: New Perspectives for Novel Therapies.,"It has been well established that the etiopathogenesis of diverse autoimmune diseases is rooted in the autoreactive immune cells' excessively proliferative state and impaired apoptotic machinery. Survivin is an anti-apoptotic and mitotic factor that has sparked a considerable research interest in this field. Survivin overexpression has been shown to contribute significantly to the development of autoimmune diseases via autoreactive immune cell overproliferation and apoptotic dysregulation. Several microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have been discovered to be involved in survivin regulation, rendering the survivin-miRNA axis a perspective target for autoimmune disease therapy. In this review, we discuss the role of survivin as an immune regulator and a highly implicated protein in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, the significance of survivin-targeting miRNAs in autoimmunity, and the feasibility of targeting the survivin-miRNA axis as a promising therapeutic option for autoimmune diseases.",Shomali N; Suliman Maashi M; Baradaran B; Daei Sorkhabi A; Sarkesh A; Mohammadi H; Hemmatzadeh M; Marofi F; Sandoghchian Shotorbani S; Jarahian M,2022,Frontiers in immunology,13,,839945,10.3389/fimmu.2022.839945,"Shomali, N., Suliman Maashi, M., Baradaran, B., Daei Sorkhabi, A., Sarkesh, A., Mohammadi, H., Hemmatzadeh, M., Marofi, F., Sandoghchian Shotorbani, S., & Jarahian, M.

39771031,Importance of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation and Molecular Regulation as Therapeutic Strategies in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Noncoding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have emerged as key players in the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MiRNAs, small endogenous RNA molecules that silence target mRNAs to regulate gene expression, are closely linked to immune responses and inflammatory pathways in IBD. Notably, miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-155 are consistently upregulated in IBD, influencing immune cell modulation, cytokine production, and the intestinal epithelial barrier. These miRNAs serve as biomarkers for disease progression and severity, as well as therapeutic targets for controlling inflammation. This comprehensive review highlights the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and miRNA regulation. It concludes that microbiota and FMT influence miRNA activity, presenting a promising avenue for personalized IBD treatment.",Brusnic O; Adrian B; Sorin-Radu F; Grama B; Sofonea F; Roman-Filip C; Roman-Filip I; Solomon A; Bîrsan S; Dura H; Porr C; Adrian C; Onisor DM,2024,Nutrients,16,24,,10.3390/nu16244411,"Brusnic, O., Adrian, B., Sorin-Radu, F., Grama, B., Sofonea, F., Roman-Filip, C., Roman-Filip, I., Solomon, A., Bîrsan, S., Dura, H., Porr, C., Adrian, C., & Onisor, D.

36435061,The role of NOD2 in intestinal immune response and microbiota modulation: A therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.,"As an intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PPR), the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) triggers a cascade of immune responses. Previous studies of NOD2 regarding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mainly focused on the relevance of NOD2 mutations and loss within the disease onset and progression. With increasing research, more studies are exploring other functional roles and clinical applications of NOD2. In this review, we discuss the role of NOD2 in intestinal immune response and microbiota modulation in IBD and explore its clinical potential as a therapeutic target for IBD.",Liu Z; Zhang Y; Jin T; Yi C; Ocansey DKW; Mao F,2022,International immunopharmacology,113,Pt B,109466,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109466,"Liu, Z., Zhang, Y., Jin, T., Yi, C., Ocansey, D.

39707170,Role of microRNAs in immunoregulatory functions of epithelial cells.,"Epithelial cells (ECs) provide the first line of defense against microbial threats and environmental challenges. They participate in the host's immune responses via the expression and secretion of various immune-related molecules such as cytokines and chemokines, as well as interaction with immune cells. A growing body of evidence suggests that the dysregulated function of ECs can be involved in the pathophysiology of a broad range of infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. To maintain a substantial immunoregulatory function of ECs, precise expression of different molecules and their regulatory effects are indispensable. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression commonly at post-transcriptional level through degradation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or suppression of protein translation. MiRNAs implicate as critical regulators in many cellular processes, including apoptosis, growth, differentiation, and immune response. Due to the crucial roles of miRNAs in such a vast range of biological processes, they have become the spotlight of biological research for more than two decades, but we are still at the beginning stages of the use of miRNA-based therapies in the improvement of human health. Hence, in the present paper, attempts are made to provide a comprehensive overview with regard to the roles of miRNAs in the immunoregulatory functions of ECs. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which immunoregulatory properties of ECs are manifested, could aid the development of efficient strategies to prevent and treat multiple human diseases.",Jafari N; Abediankenari S,2024,BMC immunology,25,1,84,10.1186/s12865-024-00675-3,"Jafari, N., & Abediankenari, S.

It is expressed in virtually every cell and is responsible for critical regulatory actions that are important in health and disease. This microRNA has been shown to potentially have a role in the pathogenesis of several immune-related disorders, including autoimmune diseases, such as Multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, as two prominent examples of diseases that might be involved.

34943865,The Impact of MicroRNAs during Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Effects on the Mucus Layer and Intercellular Junctions for Gut Permeability.,"Research on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has produced mounting evidence for the modulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) during pathogenesis. MiRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that interfere with the translation of mRNAs. Their high stability in free circulation at various regions of the body allows researchers to utilise miRNAs as biomarkers and as a focus for potential treatments of IBD. Yet, their distinct regulatory roles at the gut epithelial barrier remain elusive due to the fact that there are several external and cellular factors contributing to gut permeability. This review focuses on how miRNAs may compromise two components of the gut epithelium that together form the initial physical barrier: the mucus layer and the intercellular epithelial junctions. Here, we summarise the impact of miRNAs on goblet cell secretion and mucin structure, along with the proper function of various junctional proteins involved in paracellular transport, cell adhesion and communication. Knowledge of how this elaborate network of cells at the gut epithelial barrier becomes compromised as a result of dysregulated miRNA expression, thereby contributing to the development of IBD, will support the generation of miRNA-associated biomarker panels and therapeutic strategies that detect and ameliorate gut permeability.",Stiegeler S; Mercurio K; Iancu MA; Corr SC,2021,Cells,10,12,,10.3390/cells10123358,"Stiegeler, S., Mercurio, K., Iancu, M.

39754704,Probiotics Exert Gut Immunomodulatory Effects by Regulating the Expression of Host miRNAs.,"Probiotics exert a diverse range of immunomodulatory effects on the human gut immune system. These mechanisms encompass strengthening the intestinal mucosal barrier, inhibiting pathogen adhesion and colonization, stimulating immune modulation, and fostering the production of beneficial substances. As a result, probiotics hold significant potential in the prevention and treatment of various conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. A pivotal mechanism by which probiotics achieve these effects is through modulating the expression of host miRNAs. miRNAs, non-coding RNA molecules, are vital regulators of fundamental biological processes like cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. By interacting with mRNAs, miRNAs can either promote their degradation or repress their translation, thereby regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally and modulating the immune system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how probiotics modulate gut immune responses by altering miRNA expression levels, both upregulating and downregulating specific miRNAs. It further delves into how this modulation impacts the host's resistance to pathogens and susceptibility to diseases, offering a theoretical foundation and practical insights for the clinical utilization of probiotics in disease prevention and therapy.",Li W; Zeng Y; Zhong J; Hu Y; Xiong X; Zhou Y; Fu L,2025,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,17,2,557-568,10.1007/s12602-024-10443-9,"Li, W., Zeng, Y., Zhong, J., Hu, Y., Xiong, X., Zhou, Y., & Fu, L.

40544176,"MicroRNAs as Key Modulators of Intestinal Barrier Function: Pattern Recognition Receptors, Epithelial Junctional Complexes, and Therapeutic Approaches.","PURPOSE: This review aims to investigate the regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in intestinal barrier function, with a focus on their interaction with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4, TLR5) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors. Additionally, the review explores how miRNAs influence epithelial junctional complexes-including tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes-and their implications in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine recent studies focusing on miRNA-mediated modulation of signaling pathways related to PRRs and junctional complexes. Particular attention was given to the expression and regulation of key junctional complexes such as claudin, occludin, and zonula occludens, and their relationship with epithelial homeostasis.
RESULTS: Emerging evidence demonstrates that miRNAs modulate both inflammatory signaling and structural junctional integrity. Dysregulated expression of specific miRNAs is associated with impaired barrier function and increased intestinal permeability, contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD. Moreover, experimental data suggest that miRNA mimics and antagomiRs may help restore epithelial barrier integrity and reduce inflammation.
CONCLUSION: MiRNAs play a central role in maintaining intestinal barrier homeostasis by targeting PRRs and junctional complexes. Their ability to modulate inflammation and barrier function highlights their potential as therapeutic targets. miRNA-based strategies may offer novel, targeted treatments for IBD and other intestinal disorders.",Sevim R; Erhan S; Matur E,2025,Digestive diseases and sciences,,,,10.1007/s10620-025-09131-7,"Sevim, R., Erhan, S., & Matur, E.
