33170492,Rosacea And The Microbiome: A Systematic Review.,"rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent episodes of facial flushing, erythema, pustules, and telangiectasia, largely affects fair-skinned women over 30 years of age. although a long-recognized entity, the exact pathophysiology of this disease is still debated. current theories highlight the role of the cutaneous microbiome and its associated inflammatory effects in rosacea's pathogenesis. however, microbiological reverberations are not limited to the skin, as recent studies have described the potential cutaneous effects of alterations in the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiome. associations with additional gi pathologies, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo), irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), have been investigated, as well as helicobacter pylori infection. in an attempt to better understand and characterize these relationships, as well as current treatment options, we conducted a systematic review of the literature in pubmed, cochrane, and embase from their inception to august 6, 2020. we have synthesized the literature findings within three sections of this manuscript: the cutaneous microbiome, the gut microbiome, and therapeutic strategies. future studies should focus on specific mechanisms linking gi pathology with rosacea manifestations and the role of enteral drugs in mitigating cutaneous symptoms.",Daou H; Paradiso M; Hennessy K; Seminario-Vidal L,2021,Dermatology and therapy,11,1,1-12,10.1007/s13555-020-00460-1,"Daou, H., Paradiso, M., Hennessy, K., & Seminario-Vidal, L.

34589512,Inflammatory And Microbiota-Related Regulation Of The Intestinal Epithelial Barrier.,"the intestinal epithelial barrier (ieb) is one of the largest interfaces between the environment and the internal milieu of the body. it is essential to limit the passage of harmful antigens and microorganisms and, on the other side, to assure the absorption of nutrients and water. the maintenance of this delicate equilibrium is tightly regulated as it is essential for human homeostasis. luminal solutes and ions can pass across the ieb via two main routes: the transcellular pathway or the paracellular pathway. tight junctions (tjs) are a multi-protein complex responsible for the regulation of paracellular permeability. tjs control the passage of antigens through the ieb and have a key role in maintaining barrier integrity. several factors, including cytokines, gut microbiota, and dietary components are known to regulate intestinal tjs. gut microbiota participates in several human functions including the modulation of epithelial cells and immune system through the release of several metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (scfas). mediators released by immune cells can induce epithelial cell damage and tjs dysfunction. the subsequent disruption of the ieb allows the passage of antigens into the mucosa leading to further inflammation. growing evidence indicates that dysbiosis, immune activation, and ieb dysfunction have a role in several diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and gluten-related conditions. here we summarize the interplay between the ieb and gut microbiota and mucosal immune system and their involvement in ibs, ibd, and gluten-related disorders.",Barbara G; Barbaro MR; Fuschi D; Palombo M; Falangone F; Cremon C; Marasco G; Stanghellini V,2021,Frontiers in nutrition,8,,718356,10.3389/fnut.2021.718356,"Barbara, G., Barbaro, M.

37678185,Intestinal Proteases.,"purpose of review: proteases constitute a group of enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds. intestinal proteases are an integral part of gut homeostasis and digestion. this review discusses the broader classification of proteases, regulation of proteolytic activity (pa) in the intestinal tract, and how dysregulation of intestinal proteases contributes to the pathophysiology of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and celiac disease. we also discuss recent advancements in therapeutic modulation that directly or indirectly target intestinal proteases and can be utilized to treat these illnesses.
recent findings: host and microbiota derived proteases have been associated with symptoms in subsets of patients with ibs, ibd and celiac disease. elevated pa mediates barrier dysfunction, visceral hypersensitivity as well as immune activation and inflammation. recent mechanistic studies have revealed the nature of disease-associated proteases and mechanisms regulating their activity, particularly those driven by the microbiota. advancements in activity-based probes have allowed novel ways of in vivo imaging of pa. newer strategies targeting proteases include monoclonal antibodies, engineered microbiota as well as specific protease inhibitors.

methods: articles were extensively searched in bibliographic databases using medical subject heading and entry phrases or terms. in addition, articles were directly searched in google scholar to account for the studies omission in searching bibliographic databases. observational (cohort, cross-sectional and case-control) studies, published in english language and conducted on ibd were included. for studies meeting the eligibility criteria, the first author's name, publication year, population, study design, study area, sample size, mean platelet volume and standard deviation were extracted and entered in to microsoft-excel. the analysis was done by stata version 11. in order to estimate the pooled mean platelet volume and mean difference, random effect model was done. the heterogeneity was quantified using higgin's i2 statistics. publication bias was determined using egger's test statistics and funnel plot. sub-group analysis based on population carried to reduce heterogeneity.
results: a total of 17 relevant articles with 2957 participants (1823 ibd cases and 1134 healthy controls) were included to this study. the pooled estimated mpv was 9.29fl; 95% ci: 9.01-9.57 and 9.50fl; 95% ci: 8.81-10.20 in ibd and control groups, respectively. the standardized pooled estimate of mean difference in mean platelet volume was -0.83fl; 95% ci: -1.15, -0.51; i2: 93.1%; p-value < 0.001. in subgroup analysis based on population, the highest estimated mean difference in mpv was observed among patients of cd; -2.30; 95% ci: -3.46, -1.14; i2: 97.8%; p-value < 0.001.
conclusion: according to the current systematic review and meta-analysis, mean platelet volume was lower in ibd compared to control. the decreased mean platelet volume could be attributed to platelet consumption or sequestration associated with the progression of ibd. as a result, in ibd, mean platelet volume can provide diagnostic and prognostic information.",Bambo GM; Shiferaw E; Melku M,2022,PloS one,17,8,e0273417,10.1371/journal.pone.0273417,"Bambo, G.

materials and methods: we searched articles in pubmed/medline, web of science, and lilacs published until march 2020. observational studies evaluating the coexistence of pd in ibd and reported values of clinical periodontal parameters, or radiographic bone loss; and ibd diagnosis established by clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological criteria were deemed eligible.
results: a total of 9 studies were included (33,216 individuals). only one study reported longitudinal data on ibds onset in patients with pd. several case-control studies reported coexistence. meta-analysis showed that the presence of pd was associated with ibd (2.78 [95%ci 1.36-5.69]). pd was strongly associated both with cd (3.41 [95%ci 1.36-8.56]) and uc (3.98 [95%ci 2.02-7.87]).
conclusion: this review presents clear evidence for an association between pd and ibds. future studies should avoid non-longitudinal designs and focus on addressing direction. pd screening may be included in the multidisciplinary management of ibd patients. the mere theoretical possibility that pd may predispose to ibds may be of key significance due to the rising incidence of diseases.",Lorenzo-Pouso AI; Castelo-Baz P; Rodriguez-Zorrilla S; Pérez-Sayáns M; Vega P,2021,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,79,5,344-353,10.1080/00016357.2020.1859132,"Lorenzo-Pouso, A.

methods: we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. we searched medline and others up to 2/2022, for studies on ibd inpatients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization, compared to no prophylaxis. primary efficacy and safety outcomes were any vte and major bleeding, respectively. results were pooled using random-effects models, calculating odds ratios (or), and 95% confidence intervals (ci). the robins-i tool was used to assess bias.
results: we extracted data from 18 observational studies and 2 randomized-trial subgroups. the studies were highly variable regarding the included populations, interventions, and outcome definitions. meta-analysis of all studies showed a nonsignificant effect of prophylaxis on vtes (or: 0.97 [95% ci: 0.49-1.95]). an analysis of eight lower-risk-of-bias studies showed a significant reduction in vtes (or: 0.27 [95% ci: 0.13-0.55], number needed to treat (nnt) 34.8 [95% ci: 26.8-49.8]). a significant protective effect persisted in several subgroups. major bleeding was reported in three studies and showed a significant increase with prophylaxis (or: 2.02 [95% ci: 1.11-3.67], number needed to harm (nnh) 113.6 [95% ci: 40.7-very-large-number]).
conclusion: in studies with lower-risk-of-bias, a significant reduction in vtes was shown in patients treated with vte prophylaxis (nnt = 35), which should be carefully considered against an increased major-bleeding risk (nnh = 114). however, current data are limited and randomized trials dedicated to ibd inpatients would aid in understating whether universal prophylaxis should be recommended.",McNeil R; Fredman D; Eldar O; Gafter-Gvili A; Avni T,2024,Acta haematologica,147,6,702-715,10.1159/000538086,"McNeil, R., Fredman, D., Eldar, O., Gafter-Gvili, A., & Avni, T.

35641579,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Association Between Obesity/Overweight And Surgical Complications In Ibd.,"purpose: while the prevalence of obesity in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients is rapidly increasing, it is unclear whether obesity affects surgical outcomes in this population. this meta-analysis aims to assess the impact of obesity/overweight on patients undergoing surgery for ibd.
methods: databases (pubmed, web of science, cochrane library, and springer) were searched through september 2021. the meta-analysis included patients with surgically treated ibd to investigate the impact of obesity/overweight on this population. primary outcomes included overall complications, infectious complications, noninfectious complications, and conversion to laparotomy.
results: fifteen studies totaling 12,622 ibd patients were enrolled. compared with nonobese (including overweight) patients, obese ibd patients have increased the risk in terms of overall complications (or = 1.45, p < 0.001), infectious complications (or = 1.48, p = 0.003) (especially wound complications), as well as conversion to laparotomy (or = 1.90, p < 0.001). among the noninfectious complications, only the incidence of visceral injury (or = 2.36, p = 0.05) had significantly increased. compared with non-overweight patients, the risk of developing wound complications (or = 1.65, p = 0.01) and sepsis (or = 1.73, p = 0.007) were increased in overweight patients, but the rates of overall complications (or = 1.04, p = 0.81), infectious complications (or = 1.31, p = 0.07), and conversion to laparotomy (or = 1.33, p = 0.08) associated with body mass index (bmi) were not significantly different.
conclusion: obesity is a risk factor for surgical complications in ibd patients, mainly reflected in infectious complications. moreover, obese patients seem to have a more common chance of developing surgical complications than overweight patients.",Jiang K; Chen B; Lou D; Zhang M; Shi Y; Dai W; Shen J; Zhou B; Hu J,2022,International journal of colorectal disease,37,7,1485-1496,10.1007/s00384-022-04190-y,"Jiang, K., Chen, B., Lou, D., Zhang, M., Shi, Y., Dai, W., Shen, J., Zhou, B., & Hu, J.

38486190,Circulatory Resistin Levels In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), is a chronic relapsing-remitting systemic disease of the gastrointestinal tract with rising incidence. studies have shown that adipocytes play a crucial role in patients with ibd by actively participating in systemic immune responses. the present study was designed to investigate the correlation between the circulatory levels of resistin, as an adipokine, and active and remission phases of ibd in comparison with healthy controls.
methods: relevant articles were retrieved from pubmed, embase, the web of science, and scopus from inception until june 2023. estimation of the standardized mean difference (smd) and 95% confidence interval (ci) for comparison of plasma/serum resistin levels between ibd patients, patients in remission, and healthy controls were conducted through random-effect meta-analysis.
results: a total of 19 studies were included, assessing 1836 cases. meta-analysis indicated that generally, serum/plasma resistin levels were higher in ibd patients in comparison with healthy controls (smd 1.33, 95% ci 0.58 to 2.08, p-value < 0.01). this was true for each of the uc and cd separate analyses, as well. moreover, it was shown that higher serum/plasma resistin levels were detected in the active phase of ibd than in the remission phase (smd 1.04, 95% ci 0.65 to 1.42, p-value = 0.01). finally, higher serum/plasma resistin levels were found in the remission phase compared to healthy controls (smd 0.60, 95% ci 0.15 to 1.06, p-value < 0.01).
conclusion: the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion that circulating resistin levels are increased in ibd (both uc and cd). also, higher resistin levels were recorded in the remission phase of ibd in comparison with healthy controls. this indicates that further studies may provide valuable insights into the role of resistin in the pathogenesis of ibd.",Behnoush AH; Maroufi SP; Reshadmanesh T; Mohtasham Kia Y; Norouzi M; Mohammadi SM; Klisic A; Khalaji A,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,107,10.1186/s12876-024-03199-7,"Behnoush, A.

33721889,Ethnic Differences In The Smoking-Related Risk Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and aims: the association between smoking and inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] relies on old meta-analyses including exclusively non-jewish white populations. uncertainty persists regarding the role of smoking in other ethnicities.
methods: we systematically searched medline/pubmed, embase, and scopus for studies examining tobacco smoking and the risk of developing ibd, ie, crohn's disease [cd] or ulcerative colitis [uc]. two authors independently extracted study data and assessed each study's risk of bias. we examined heterogeneity and small-study effect, and calculated summary estimates using random-effects models. stratified analyses and meta-regression were employed to study the association between study-level characteristics and effect estimates. the strength of epidemiological evidence was assessed through prespecified criteria.
results: we synthesised 57 studies examining the smoking-related risk of developing cd and uc. non-jewish white smokers were at increased risk of cd (29 studies; relative risk [rr]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.69‒2.24; moderate evidence). no association was observed in asian, jewish. and latin-american populations [11 studies; rr: 0.97; 95% ci: 0.83-1.13], with no evidence of heterogeneity across these ethnicities. smokers were at reduced risk of uc [51 studies; rr: 0.55, 95% ci: 0.48-0.64; weak evidence] irrespectively of ethnicity; however, cohort studies, large studies, and those recently published showed attenuated associations.
conclusions: this meta-analysis did not identify any increased risk of cd in smokers in ethnicities other than non-jewish whites, and confirmed the protective effect of smoking on uc occurrence. future research should characterise the genetic background of cd patients across different ethnicities to improve our understanding of the role of smoking in cd pathogenesis.",Piovani D; Pansieri C; Kotha SRR; Piazza AC; Comberg CL; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S; Bonovas S,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,10,1658-1678,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab047,"Piovani, D., Pansieri, C., Kotha, S.

36550400,Prevalence Of Frailty Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Its Association With Clinical Outcomes: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: studies have reported frailty as an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to determine the relationship of frailty and ibd. we aimed to investigate the prevalence of frailty in patients with ibd and the impact of frailty on the clinical prognosis of these patients.
methods: we systematically searched pubmed, ovid (medline), embase, web of science, and cochrane library from database inception until october 2022. this systematic review included observational studies describing ibd and frailty. we performed meta-analysis for the frailty prevalence in patients with ibd. we analyzed primary outcomes (mortality) and secondary outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, readmission, and ibd-related surgery).
results: nine studies with a total of 1,495,695 participants were included in our meta-analysis. the prevalence of frailty was 18% in patients with ibd. the combined effect analysis showed that frail patients with ibd had a higher risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-4.55) than non-frail patients with ibd. the hazard ratio for infections (hr = 1.23, 0.94-1.60), hospitalizations (hr = 1.72, 0.88-3.36), readmission (hr = 1.21, 1.17-1.25) and ibd-related surgery (hr = 0.78, 0.66-0.91) in frail patients with ibd.
conclusions: we demonstrated that frailty is a significant independent predictor of mortality in patients with ibd. our work supports the importance of implementing frailty screening upon admission in patients with ibd. more prospective studies are needed to investigate the influence of frailty on patients with ibd and improve the poor prognosis of patients with frailty and ibd.",Huang X; Xiao M; Jiang B; Wang X; Tang X; Xu X; Chen Y; Wang S; Yan S; Wang S; Wang J; Zhang P,2022,BMC gastroenterology,22,1,534,10.1186/s12876-022-02620-3,"Huang, X., Xiao, M., Jiang, B., Wang, X., Tang, X., Xu, X., Chen, Y., Wang, S., Yan, S., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Zhang, P.

aim: to compare disease course and treatment outcomes in ibd patients with and without dm.
methods: this is a systematic review with meta-analysis comparing patients with ibd plus dm with patients with ibd only.
primary endpoints: need for surgery, ibd-related complications, hospitalizations, sepsis, mortality. quality of life and costs were assessed.
results: five studies with 71,216 patients (49.1% with dm) were included. risk for ibd-related complications (or=1.12, i2 98% p = 0.77), mortality (or=1.52, i2 98% p = 0.37) and ibd-related surgery (or=1.20, i2 81% p = 0.26) did not differ. risk of ibd-related hospitalizations (or=2.52, i2 0% p < 0.00001) and sepsis (or=1.56, i2 88% p = 0.0003) was higher in the ibd+dm group. risk of pneumonia and urinary tract infections was higher in the ibd+dm group (or=1.72 and or=1.93), while risk of c. difficile infection did not differ (or=1.22 i2 88% p = 0.37). mean short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score was lower in the ibd+dm group (38.9 vs. 47, p = 0.03). mean health care costs per year were $10,598.2 vs $3747.3 (p < 0.001).

38272759,Do Interventions For Mood Improve Inflammatory Biomarkers In Inflammatory Bowel Disease?: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms and the gut-brain axis appear relevant to disease activity and progression in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). a recent review showed no effect of psychological therapies on self-reported disease activity in ibd. this meta-analysis aims to establish whether interventions targeting mood outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety and stress) impact inflammation levels in ibd and possible moderators of these effects.
methods: the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines were followed. we searched five electronic databases and included randomised controlled trials where interventions targeted mood and assessed inflammatory outcomes pre- and post-intervention in adults with ibd. independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. data were pooled to estimate standardised mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (cis). a random-effects robust variance estimation accounted for studies measuring multiple biomarkers. intervention type, mood as a primary or secondary outcome, effect on mood outcomes and ibd subtype were investigated as treatment effect moderators. where there were sufficient biomarkers, individual meta-analyses were run (pre-registration prospero: crd42023389401).
findings: 28 rcts involving 1789 participants met inclusion criteria. interventions demonstrated small, statistically significant effects on biomarkers (-0.35, 95% ci: -0.48, -0.22, p < 0.001) and medium effects on mood outcomes (-0.50, 95% ci: -0.73, -0.27, p < 0.001), without evidence of substantive heterogeneity or publication bias. individual analyses showed small effects for improved faecal calprotectin (-0.19, 95% ci: -0.34, -0.03, p = 0.018) and c-reactive protein (-0.29, 95% ci: -0.47, -0.10, p = 0.002). effect sizes were larger for psychological therapy interventions (compared with exercise or antidepressants) and when there was an effect (smd ≥0.2) on mood.
interpretation: treatments which address mood outcomes have beneficial effects on generic inflammation as well as disease-specific biomarkers (faecal calprotectin and c-reactive protein). psychological interventions and interventions with larger treatment effects on mood accentuated the effect on biomarkers. more research is required to understand the biological or behavioural mechanisms underlying this effect.

32330874,Volatomics In Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"volatile organic compounds (vocs) are produced by the human metabolism, inflammation and gut microbiota and form the basis of innovative volatomics research. vocs detected through breath and faecal analysis hence serve as attractive, non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). this review describes the clinical applicability of volatomics in discriminating between ibs, ibd and healthy volunteers with acceptable accuracy in breath (70%-100%) and faecal (58%-85%) samples. promising compounds are propan-1-ol for diagnosing and monitoring of ibd patients, and 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohexa-1,4-diene as biomarker for ibs diagnosis. however, these vocs often seem to be related to inflammation and probably will need to be used in conjunction with other clinical evidence. furthermore, three interventional studies underlined the potential of vocs in predicting treatment outcome and patient follow-up. this shows great promise for future use of vocs as non-invasive breath and faecal biomarkers in personalised medicine. however, properly designed studies that correlate vocs to ibd/ibs pathogenesis, while taking microbial influences into account, are still key before clinical implementation can be expected.",Van Malderen K; De Winter BY; De Man JG; De Schepper HU; Lamote K,2020,EBioMedicine,54,,102725,10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102725,"Van Malderen, K., De Winter, B.

38006941,Indigo Naturalis (Qing Dai) For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: indigo naturalis (qing dai) is a traditional therapy reported to be useful in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), especially for ulcerative colitis. we performed a systematic review of its efficacy and safety in ibd.
methods: electronic databases (pubmed, embase, and scopus) were searched on 4th march 2023 to identify reports about the use of indigo naturalis in ibd. we extracted data with respect to clinical response, remission, endoscopic and histological responses, and adverse events with the use of indigo naturalis in ibd. pooled clinical response rates and remission rates were calculated. the quality of studies was assessed using joanna-briggs tools.
results: nine studies reporting on 299 patients were included. the pooled clinical response rate was 0.796 (95 %ci, 0.7465-0.8379, i2=0), and the clinical remission rate in ulcerative colitis was 0.668 (0.488- 0.809, i2=85.2 %). the pooled relative risk of clinical response was higher in the indigo naturalis group as compared to placebo in the two randomized trials [3.82 (2.04; 7.14, i2=0)]. except for one reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension case, most reported adverse effects were mild. the endoscopic and histological responses, when reported, suggested that indigo naturalis is effective for ulcerative colitis. the limitations of the systematic review included a small number of randomized studies, reports only from east asia and a relatively small number of patients, especially for crohn's disease.
conclusion: indigo naturalis is effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. future studies should evaluate the comparative efficacy with other drugs.",Kakdiya R; Jha DK; Choudhury A; Jena A; Sharma V,2024,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,48,1,102250,10.1016/j.clinre.2023.102250,"Kakdiya, R., Jha, D.

methods: observational studies investigating the ra risk among patients with ibd (crohn disease (cd) and/or ulcerative colitis (uc)) were searched in pubmed, embase, and web of science from the date of inception to december 2019. the methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale. relative risks (rrs) and corresponding 95% confidential intervals (cis) were pooled with a random-effects model. heterogeneity was evaluated using i2 statistics while publication bias was determined using begg's and egger's tests. subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
results: a total of three cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two case-control studies were included in the meta-analyses. compared to the non-ibd control or general population, there was a significantly higher risk of ra among patients with ibd (rr = 2.59; 95% ci: 1.93-3.48). moreover, both cd (rr = 3.14; 95% ci: 2.46-4.01) and uc (rr = 2.29; 95% ci: 1.76-2.97) were associated with a significantly increased risk of ra. however, heterogeneity was substantial across studies and the subgroup analyses failed to identify the potential source of heterogeneity.

aims: to examine the prevalence of icp in pregnancies with ibd and associations with thiopurine exposure.
methods: an electronic search of medline, embase, and embase classic databases using search terms for ibd and icp from inception to 10th september 2024 was performed. studies involving pregnant adults with a confirmed diagnosis of ibd reporting icp were included. prevalence and event numbers for icp were pooled using a random effects model.
results: we identified two case reports, a case series of eight cases, and three cohort studies. pooled prevalence of icp in 1603 pregnancies with ibd was 3% (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.0%-7.0%). one cohort study reported that the prevalence of icp in ibd was significantly higher compared to the general population (odds ratio [or] 3.08 [95% ci 1.11-8.56], p = 0.039). meta-analysis showed that thiopurine exposure was associated with an increased risk of icp, or 6.65 [95% ci 3.10-14.25]. one cohort study showed that, compared to non-ibd controls, the incidence of icp was increased in thiopurine exposed pregnancies (or 7.55 [95% ci 2.52-22.57] p < 0.001) but not in non-exposed pregnancies (or 1.41 [95% ci 0.40-4.92], p = 0.75).

35067654,The Prevalence And Incidence Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Inflammatory Bowel Disease In Depression And Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"objective: the increased prevalence and incidence of affective disorders among patients with gastrointestinal disease have been well established. however, few studies have investigated the inverse relationship. we aimed to identify all pieces of evidence of the prevalence and incidence of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) in people with depression and bipolar disorder.
methods: we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the association between affective disorders (exposure) and ibs or ibd (outcome) in adults. evidence was evaluated for quality using joanna briggs institute critical appraisal tools. where suitable data were available, meta-analyses were performed.
results: we identified 18 studies that met the selection criteria, of which 11 provided data on ibs, 5 on ibd, and 2 on both. overall, people with depression were significantly more likely to have comorbid ibs (risk ratio = 2.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.98-2.96) and to develop new-onset ibs (risk ratio = 1.90, 95% confidence interval = 1.41-2.56) compared with people without depression. they were also more likely to have and develop ibd, and among patients with ibd, significantly increased rates of depression were observed as early as 5 years before diagnosis. bipolar disorder was not consistently associated with risk of either condition.
conclusions: people with depression are at an increased risk of both having and developing lower gastrointestinal disorders. these findings have important implications for how we understand, manage, and prevent this comorbidity in clinical practice. further studies are needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between bipolar disorder and bowel disease as well as the role of psychotropic medication, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",Nikolova VL; Pelton L; Moulton CD; Zorzato D; Cleare AJ; Young AH; Stone JM,2022,Psychosomatic medicine,84,3,313-324,10.1097/PSY.0000000000001046,"Nikolova, V.

33010814,Prevalence Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Type Symptoms In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease In Remission: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) often report symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), which might have an effect on psychological health. however, previous estimates of the magnitude of this issue have not accounted for ongoing inflammation as the potential cause. we updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis to determine prevalence of ibs-type symptoms in patients with ibd in remission to better quantify the magnitude of this issue.
methods: in this systematic review and meta-analysis, embase, embase classic, and medline were searched (from jan 1, 2012, to may 11, 2020) to identify prospective case-control or cross-sectional studies reporting prevalence of symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for ibs in adults with ibd in remission. studies were required to have recruited an unselected adult population (more than 90% of participants aged ≥16 years) with histologically or radiologically confirmed ibd and include at least 50 participants. pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ors) with 95% cis were calculated according to the definition of remission, criteria used to define ibs-type symptoms, and type of ibd. the association between ibs-type symptom reporting and psychological comorbidity was examined using weighted mean difference (wmd) or standardised mean difference (smd) in anxiety and depression scores between those reporting ibs-type symptoms and those not, for cases in which these data were available.
findings: of 3370 studies identified, 27 were eligible, of which 18 were newly identified. among 3169 patients with ibd in remission, pooled prevalence of ibs-type symptoms was 32·5% (95% ci 27·4-37·9; i2=90·1%). prevalence was lower when remission was defined by endoscopic assessment (23·5%, 95% ci 17·9-29·6; i2=59·9%) or histological assessment (25.8%, 95% ci 20.2-31.7; i2=not applicable) than when defined by validated clinical disease activity index (33·6%, 26·3-41·2; i2=91·8%) and higher in crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis (36·6%, 29·5-44·0; i2=82·9% vs 28·7%, 22·9-34·8; i2=87·2%). anxiety (wmd 2·5; 95% ci 0·8-4·3) and depression (smd 0·64; 0·44-0·84) scores were significantly higher among those who reported ibs-type symptoms than in those who did not.
interpretation: prevalence of symptoms compatible with ibs in patients with ibd varied according to how remission was defined. however, even when stringent criteria such as endoscopic or histological remission were used, about a quarter of patients reported these symptoms. such symptoms were more common in patients with crohn's disease and were associated with psychological comorbidity. addressing psychological wellbeing might improve outcomes in this specific group of patients.

34927756,Review Article: Diagnosis And Investigation Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction. it is defined by the rome criteria as the presence of abdominal pain, related to defaecation, associated with a change in stool form and/or frequency. the approach to diagnosis and investigation of suspected ibs varies between clinicians and, due in part to the uncertainty that can surround the diagnosis, many still consider it to be a diagnosis of exclusion. however, exhaustive investigation is both unnecessary and costly, and may also be counterproductive. instead, physicians should aim to make a positive diagnosis, based on their clinical assessment of symptoms, and limit their use of investigations. the yield of routine blood tests in suspected ibs is low overall, but normal inflammatory markers may be reassuring. all patients should have serological testing for coeliac disease, irrespective of their predominant stool form. routine testing of stool microbiology or faecal elastase is unnecessary; however, all patients with diarrhoea aged <45 should have a faecal calprotectin or a similar marker measured which, if positive, should lead to colonoscopy to exclude possible inflammatory bowel disease. colonoscopy should also be undertaken in any patient reporting alarm symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer, and in those whose presentation raises suspicion for microscopic colitis. testing for bile acid diarrhoea should be considered for patients with ibs with diarrhoea where available. hydrogen breath tests for lactose malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth have no role in the routine assessment of suspected ibs. adopting a standardised approach to the diagnosis and investigation of ibs will help to promote high-quality and high-value care for patients overall.",Black CJ,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54 Suppl 1,,S33-S43,10.1111/apt.16597,"Black, C.

methods: we searched medline, embase, embase classic, psychinfo, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials for relevant articles published by march 2024.
results: the bi-directional relationship between psychological well-being and adverse longitudinal disease activity outcomes, and the high prevalence of ibs-type symptom reporting highlight the presence of gba-mediated effects in ibd. treatments targeting gut-brain interactions including brain-gut behavioural treatments, neuromodulators, and dietary interventions appear to be useful adjunctive treatments in a subset of patients.
conclusions: psychological morbidity is prevalent in patients with ibd. the relationship between longitudinal disease activity outcomes, ibs-type symptom reporting, and poor psychological health is mediated via the gba. proactive management of psychological health should be integrated into routine care. further clinical trials of gba-targeted therapies, conducted in selected groups of patients with co-existent common mental disorders, or those who report ibs-type symptoms, are required to inform effective integrated models of care in the future.",Riggott C; Ford AC; Gracie DJ,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,60,9,1200-1214,10.1111/apt.18192,"Riggott, C., Ford, A.

methods: seven databases were comprehensively retrieved from their establishment to march 23, 2025. the combined results were described through standardized mean differences (smd) or odds ratios (or) with 95% confidence intervals (ci). review manager 5.4 and stata 15.0 were leveraged for data analysis.
results: our analysis included 35 studies involving 5,870 patients. the aggregated data revealed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (nlr) (or = 1.18, 95% ci:1.04 to 1.34; p = 0.001) (smd = 1.01, 95%ci = 0.73 to 1.29, p < 0.001), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (plr) (smd = 0.60, 95%ci = 0.46 to 0.74, p < 0.001), neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (npr) (or = 1.20, 95% ci:1.08 to 1.32, p < 0.001), and c-reactive protein to albumin ratio (crp/alb) (or = 1.50, 95% ci:1.38 to 1.65, p < 0.001) were potentially linked to disease activity in ibd patients. plr (smd = 1.08, 95%ci = 0.60 to 1.55, p < 0.001) showed potential associations with disease severity in ibd patients. additionally, nlr (smd = 0.43, 95%ci = 0.15 to 0.70, p = 0.002) and eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (elr) (smd = 0.63, 95%ci = 0.26 to 1.00, p < 0.001) had potential associations with endoscopic response in ibd patients. moreover, nlr was potentially associated with disease relapse(or = 1.35, 95% ci:1.09 to 1.68; p = 0.006) and steroid responsiveness (smd = 0.50, 95%ci = 0.15 to 0.85, p = 0.005).
conclusion: nlr, plr, npr, and crp/alb are potential predictors of disease activity in ibd patients. plr shows the potential to predict disease severity, while nlr and elr are potential indicators of endoscopic response. furthermore, nlr is also a potential predictor of relapse and steroid responsiveness. currently, there is insufficient evidence to support an association between nlr and the severity of ibd, whereas lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (lmr) appears to be associated with both the severity and activity of ibd and plr and eosinophil*neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (enlr) are associated with endoscopic response in ibd.

methods: multiple databases were searched for relevant case-control studies. indicators used to diagnose bam included 75 se-homocholic acid taurine (sehcat), 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one(c4), fibroblast growth factor-19 and 48-hour fecal bile acid (48fba). the rate of bam (sehcat) was calculated by using a random-effect model. the levels of c4, fgf19, and 48fba were compared, and the overall effect size was combined by a fixed effect model.
results: the search strategy identified 10 relevant studies comprising 1034 ibs-d patients and 232 healthy volunteers. the pooled rate of bam in ibs-d patients was 32% (according to sehcat; 95% ci: 24%-40%). the level of c4 in ibs-d patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (2.86 ng/ml; 95% ci: 1.09, 4.63); the level of fgf19 was significantly lower than that in the control group (-33.97 pg/ml; 95% ci: -51.13, -16.82); the level of 48fba was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.059; 95% ci: 0.41, 0.77).
conclusions: the results mainly concluded serum c4 and fgf19 levels in ibs-d patients. most of the studies have different normal cutoff points of serum c4 and fgf19 levels; the performance of each test should be further estimated. by comparing the levels of these biomarkers, bam in patients with ibs-d could be identified more accurately, which would lead to more effective treatment.",Liu T; Ma M; Li K; Tan W; Yu H; Wang L,,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,57,5,451-458,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001841,"Liu, T., Ma, M., Li, K., Tan, W., Yu, H., & Wang, L.

35911403,Diagnostic Utility Of Non-Invasive Tests For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Umbrella Review.,"background: this study aims to consolidate evidence from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the diagnostic performances of non-invasive tests for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) in various clinical conditions and age groups.
methods: two independent reviewers systematically identified and appraised systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the diagnostic utility of non-invasive tests for ibd. each association was categorized as adults, children, and mixed population, based on the age ranges of patients included in the primary studies. we classified clinical scenarios into diagnosis, activity assessment, and predicting recurrence.
results: in total, 106 assessments from 43 reviews were included, with 17 non-invasive tests. fecal calprotectin (fc) and fecal lactoferrin (fl) were the most sensitive for distinguishing ibd from non-ibd. however, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (anca) and fl were the most specific for it. fc and fl were the most sensitive and specific tests, respectively, to distinguish ibd from irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (asca), iga, were the best test to distinguish crohn's disease (cd) from ulcerative colitis (uc). interferon-γ release assay was the best test to distinguish cd from intestinal tuberculosis (itb). ultrasound (us) and magnetic resonance enterography (mre) were both sensitive and specific for disease activity, along with the high sensitivity of fc. small intestine contrast ultrasonography (sicus) had the highest sensitivity, and fc had the highest specificity for operative cd recurrence.
conclusion: in this umbrella review, we summarized the diagnostic performance of non-invasive tests for ibd in various clinical conditions and age groups. clinicians can use the suggested non-invasive test depending on the appropriate clinical situation in ibd patients.",Shi JT; Zhang Y; She Y; Goyal H; Wu ZQ; Xu HG,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,920732,10.3389/fmed.2022.920732,"Shi, J.

methods: four international databases, pubmed, embase, scopus, and the web of science were systematically searched for studies assessing ghrelin or obestatin levels in patients with ibd (either crohn's disease [cd] or ulcerative colitis [uc]) in active phase or in remission. random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to calculate the pooled estimate using the standardized mean difference (smd) and 95% confidence interval (ci).
results: nineteen studies were included in our systematic review, comprising 1064 patients with ibd (476 uc and 588 cd). a meta-analysis of 11 studies for comparison of active and quiescent disease showed that patients with active ibd had significantly higher levels of ghrelin (smd, 0.70; 95% ci, 0.06 to 1.34; p = .03). however, in separate analyses for uc or cd, no such difference was observed (smd, 1.30; 95% ci, -0.28 to 2.88, p = .11; and smd, 0.80; 95% ci, -0.41 to 2.01; p = .20, respectively). no significant difference was also observed in ghrelin levels between patients with active ibd and healthy control subjects. obestatin levels also were not different between patients with active disease and those in remission (smd, 0.31; 95% ci, -0.05 to 0.68; p = .09). on the other hand, the obestatin/ghrelin ratio was significantly lower in patients with active ibd (smd, -1.90; 95% ci, -2.45 to -1.35; p < .01).

33189181,The Overlap Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Organic Gastrointestinal Diseases.,"irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common functional bowel disorder characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habit. this condition is one of the most frequent reasons to seek a gastroenterology consultation in primary and secondary care. the diagnosis of ibs is made by identifying characteristic symptoms, as defined by the rome criteria, and excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases that might otherwise explain these symptoms. organic conditions that can be mistaken for ibs include coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), colorectal cancer, and, in those with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms, chronic gastrointestinal infections, microscopic colitis, and primary bile acid diarrhoea. the concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth being associated with ibs is shrouded with controversy and uncertainty, mainly because of invalid tests due to poor sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions. there is insufficient evidence to link ibs-type symptoms with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, since both are hampered by conflicting data. finally, there is growing appreciation that ibs can present in patients with known but stable organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as quiescent ibd or coeliac disease. recognising functional gut symptoms in these individuals is paramount so that potentially harmful escalations in immunosuppressive therapy can be avoided and attention can be focused on addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction. this review endeavours to aid clinicians who practise adult gastroenterology in recognising the potential overlap between ibs and organic gastrointestinal diseases and highlights areas in need of further research and clarity.",Aziz I; Simrén M,2021,The lancet.

methods: studies were identified through literature search of the pubmed, embase, and cochrane databases (from inception inclusive april 2024) for english studies. the criteria for selecting participants were as follows: (1) studies including patients with crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis in the asian population; (2) comparisons were specified as with control group of non-ibd patients for comparative incidence; and (3) outcomes were measured by relative risks (rrs) and hazard risk for vte incidence in nationwide cohort studies. three independent reviewers extracted published data using standardized procedure in accordance with the reporting guidelines. a fixed-effects model was used to estimate pooled effect sizes. meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify the potential moderating effects of vte risk in ibd patients.
results: five studies met the inclusion criteria. the pooled rr for overall vte incidence in asian ibd patients compared with that in non-ibd patients was 2.065 (95% ci: 1.905-2.238). there was no statistical moderating effect of the variables (mean age, female rate, cd proportion, and country) on the outcomes.

40272527,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Cytomegalovirus-Associated Adverse Outcomes And Healthcare Resource Utilization In Hospitalized Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"purpose: serious complications and unplanned healthcare utilization are reported among inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) hospitalizations with associated cytomegalovirus (cmv). the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the in-hospital outcomes of cmv-related hospitalization in ibd patients.
methods: electronic databases were systematically searched in pubmed, web of science (isi), scopus, embase, and google scholar until february 2024. the quality of the included studies was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale. cochran's q test and i2 statistics were applied to evaluate potential heterogeneity across eligible studies. the random-effects model obtained pooled odds ratio (or) estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (ci).
results: sixteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing 5120 ibd patients diagnosed with comorbid cmv infection. our findings indicated that compared to ibd patients without cmv, those with both cmv and ibd had a longer hospital length of stay (los) (8.65 days longer; 95% ci: 6.96, 10.34; p < 0.01), a greater colectomy risk (or = 2.26; 95% ci: 1.53, 3.34; p < 0.01), and higher in-hospital mortality (or = 2.83; 95% ci: 1.92, 4.16; p < 0.01). however, the difference in hospital charges between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.78). sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out approach revealed significant changes in hospital costs after excluding certain studies. additionally, subgroup analyses showed significant differences based on ibd subtypes for surgery risk and los.
conclusion: our findings suggest that cmv infection is associated with poorer outcomes in hospitalized ibd patients, highlighting the importance of early detection and appropriate management of cmv infection in this population to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare resource utilization.",Gholami Shahrebabak M; Kouchaki H; Gholami Shahrebabak A; Ravankhah M; Abdollahi M; Akbari M; Lankarani KB,2025,International journal of colorectal disease,40,1,101,10.1007/s00384-025-04886-x,"Gholami Shahrebabak, M., Kouchaki, H., Gholami Shahrebabak, A., Ravankhah, M., Abdollahi, M., Akbari, M., & Lankarani, K.

35812241,Metabolomics: The Key To Unraveling The Role Of The Microbiome In Visceral Pain Neurotransmission.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), comprising crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a relapsing and remitting disease of the gastrointestinal tract, presenting with chronic inflammation, ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. up to 80% of patients suffering from ibd experience acute pain, which dissipates when the underlying inflammation and tissue damage resolves. however, despite achieving endoscopic remission with no signs of ongoing intestinal inflammation or damage, 30-50% of ibd patients in remission experience chronic abdominal pain, suggesting altered sensory neuronal processing in this disorder. furthermore, effective treatment for chronic pain is limited such that 5-25% of ibd outpatients are treated with narcotics, with associated morbidity and mortality. ibd patients commonly present with substantial alterations to the microbial community structure within the gastrointestinal tract, known as dysbiosis. the same is also true in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), a chronic disorder characterized by altered bowel habits and abdominal pain, in the absence of inflammation. an emerging body of literature suggests that the gut microbiome plays an important role in visceral hypersensitivity. specific microbial metabolites have an intimate relationship with host receptors that are highly expressed on host cell and neurons, suggesting that microbial metabolites play a key role in visceral hypersensitivity. in this review, we will discuss the techniques used to analysis the metabolome, current potential metabolite targets for visceral hypersensitivity, and discuss the current literature that evaluates the role of the post-inflammatory microbiota and metabolites in visceral hypersensitivity.",Shute A; Bihan DG; Lewis IA; Nasser Y,2022,Frontiers in neuroscience,16,,917197,10.3389/fnins.2022.917197,"Shute, A., Bihan, D.

40375116,Influence Of The Metabolic And Inflammatory Profile In Patients With Frozen Shoulder - Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: frozen shoulder (fs), also known as adhesive shoulder capsulitis, is characterized by a fibrotic inflammatory process of unknown origin, with the most prominent symptoms being pain, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility.
methods: the systematic review and meta-analysis presented herein provide insights into the pathogenesis of this condition, as well as common metabolic biomarkers potentially implicated in fs, such as glycated hemoglobin (hba1c), and inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukins (il-1, il-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α). dyslipidemia and hormonal factors, such as thyroid dysfunctions, are also examined.
results: a total of 7,499 individuals were included in the meta-analysis, and one additional study collected 28,416 blood samples from individuals with fs from biobanks. the meta-analysis of metabolic variables showed that hba1c was the most significantly elevated marker in fs, with a standardized mean difference (smd) of μ^ = 0.3970 (95% ci: 0.0998 to 0.6943), indicating a moderate effect. glucose showed a mean difference of -0.28 (95% ci: -0.60 to 0.05), which was not statistically significant, suggesting that short-term fluctuations in glucose levels may not be as relevant as long-term metabolic control. cholesterol had a standardized difference of 0.278 (95% ci: 0.171 to 0.385), being significantly higher in fs. for triglycerides, the smd was μ^ = 1.0318 (95% ci: -1.0027 to 3.0664), indicating high heterogeneity and preventing a clear conclusion. hypothyroidism was also evaluated, with a total smd of 0.067, a total variance of 0.0021, and a 95% confidence interval of -0.024 to 0.158, confirming no association between fs and thyroid function. regarding inflammatory biomarkers, il-1β was the most predominant, showing significantly higher levels in fs, with an smd of μ^ = 2.2671 (95% ci: 0.5750 to 3.9591). tnf-α had a mean difference of μ^ = 0.7814 (95% ci: 0.1013 to 1.4615), reflecting a significant difference from zero (z = 2.2520, p = 0.0243). finally, il-6 did not show a significant association, with an smd of μ^ = 1.6721 (95% ci: -0.9368 to 4.2810).
conclusion: this meta-analysis highlights the role of metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of fs. hba1c and cholesterol were the most associated metabolic biomarkers, while il-1β and tnf-α showed a strong link to inflammation and fibrosis. the heterogeneity in triglycerides and il-6 underscores the need for studies with standardized methodologies and subgroup analyses. future research should focus on biomarker progression, patient stratification, and new therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic and immune modulation, considering fs within a broader metabolic-inflammatory framework to improve its classification and treatment.",Hamed-Hamed D; Rodríguez-Pérez C; Pruimboom L; Navarro-Ledesma S,2025,BMC musculoskeletal disorders,26,1,475,10.1186/s12891-025-08706-9,"Hamed-Hamed, D., Rodríguez-Pérez, C., Pruimboom, L., & Navarro-Ledesma, S.

40205601,Prevalence Of Metabolic Syndrome In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis On A Global Scale.,"background: metabolic syndrome (mets) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (cvd). patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) may be at higher risk of developing mets due to chronic inflammation, altered adipokine profiles, and the effects of corticosteroid treatment. however, the prevalence of mets in ibd patients remains inconsistent across studies. this meta-analysis aims to estimate the prevalence of mets in ibd patients and compare its occurrence between crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc).
methods: a systematic search was conducted across pubmed, scopus, embase, and web of science from their inception up to january 19, 2025. eligible observational studies reporting mets prevalence in ibd patients were included. meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via the i2 statistic. comprehensive meta-analysis (cma) software, version 4.0 was used for analysis.
results: the pooled prevalence of mets in ibd patients was 21.8% (95% ci: 14.3-31.6%). the prevalence was higher in uc patients (32.7%, 95% ci: 16.0-55.5%) compared to cd patients (14.1%, 95% ci: 8.6-22.3%). patients with uc had significantly higher odds of mets than those with cd (or = 1.38, 95% ci: 1.03-1.85, p = 0.02). additionally, ibd patients with mets were significantly older than those without (md: 9.89, 95% ci: 5.12-14.67, p < 0.01).
conclusion: in summary, this meta-analysis reveals a notable prevalence of mets among patients with ibd, particularly in those with uc, where the prevalence is higher than in cd. the analysis also shows that ibd patients with mets tend to be older, suggesting age as a contributing factor. these findings underscore the need for routine metabolic screening in ibd care, especially in uc and elderly patients.",Janani KV; Saberian P; Patel HB; Keetha NR; Etemadzadeh A; Patel A; Hashemi SM; Amini-Salehi E; Gurram A,2025,"Journal of health, population, and nutrition",44,1,112,10.1186/s41043-025-00860-z,"Janani, K.

37150763,Is The Microbiome The Cause Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Inflammatory Bowel Disease? Lessons To Consider From Odontology.,"background: a substantial amount of research is pointing to the disrupted microbiome and dysfunctional host-microbiome interaction as potential causes of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the true cause of the diseases is still not fully elucidated, and the various treatments used are not truly effective in the long run, especially for ibd, since a true cure is not known to exist. treatment failure and surgery are common for ibd, many times leading to a perceived lower quality of life, not to mention the enormous cost for society for treatment up until that point and after. although it is clear that the microbiome has a major role in the disease, it seems the majority of the research and treatments are still focused on treating and understanding the inflammation and not the primary cause of the inflammation in the first place. this was also the case for many decades in the search for the cause of periodontitis (pd) and gingivitis (gv), a destructive and non-destructive inflammatory disorder, respectively, the first resulting in loss of tissue supporting the teeth. there was much uncertainty and confusion until it was fully established that the microbiome was the cause. pd treatments primarily nowadays reflect the cause, i.e. the removal of microbes. there is no doubt, however, that the inflammatory pathways are important in both diseases and the purpose of this text is not to dispute this in respect to gastrointestinal disorders too. however, a different view on inflammation and associated disorders is explored to explain the nature of extraintestinal manifestations.
purpose: the aim of this report is not to systematically fully review the literature to try to strengthen causality, as there are many reviews that explore the microbial aspects of ibs and ibd. instead, the objective is to above all reflect on what has been learned in the field of odontology/stomatology and discuss relevant gastrointestinal research in order to propose tentative hypotheses and questions regarding ibs and ibd aetiology. perhaps it could help soften the confusion regarding the microbial aetiology and dysbiosis concept, while guiding future research and treatments, primarily regarding microbial transplants, antibiotics, and diet.",Andersson OP,2023,International journal of colorectal disease,38,1,117,10.1007/s00384-023-04406-9,"Andersson, O.

methods: according to the guidelines outlined in the prisma and meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (moose), we conducted a comprehensive search of pubmed, web of science, embase, and the cochrane library databases for relevant cohort and case-control studies comparing the incidence of adverse outcomes between ibd patients exposed to ppis and those not exposed, from the inception of the databases to april 2024. the primary adverse outcomes analyzed included hospitalization and surgery.
results: five studies, encompassing nearly 100,000 subjects, were included in this meta-analysis. the findings indicated that ibd patients exposed to ppis had a significantly higher incidence of adverse outcomes compared to those not exposed (odds ratio [or] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.07-1.44, p = 0.004), although it was low-quality evidence. this increased risk was observed in both ulcerative colitis (or = 1.38, 95% ci = 1.04-1.83, p = 0.025) and crohn's disease (or = 1.14, 95% ci = 1.02-1.29, p = 0.025). additionally, the incidence of surgery was higher in ibd patients with ppi exposure (or = 1.31, 95% ci = 1.02-1.68). however, the or for hospitalization did not show a statistically significant difference (or = 1.43, p = 0.244). moreover, the use of glucocorticoids was more frequent among patients exposed to ppis (or = 1.16, 95% ci = 1.06-1.28, p = 0.001).

38821336,Metabolic Biomarkers In Irritable Bowel Syndrome Diagnosis.,"irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a chronic gastrointestinal (gi) disorder characterized by altered bowel habits and abdominal discomfort during defecation. it significantly impacts life quality and work productivity for those affected. global data suggests a slightly higher prevalence in females than in males. today, unambiguous diagnosis of ibs remains challenging due to the absence of a specific biochemical, histopathological, or radiological test. current diagnosis relies heavily on thorough symptom evaluation. efforts by the rome committees have established standardized diagnostic criteria (rome i-iv), improving consistency and clinical applicability. recent studies in this framework, seem to have successfully employed metabolomics techniques to identify distinct metabolite profiles in breath and stool samples of ibs patients, differentiating them from healthy controls and those with other functional gi disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). building on this success, researchers are investigating the presence of similar metabolites in easily accessible biofluids such as urine, potentially offering a less invasive diagnostic approach. accordingly, this review focuses on key metabolites specifically detected in ibs patients' biological specimens, with a focus on urinary metabolites, using various methods, particularly mass spectrometry (ms)-based techniques, including gas chromatography-ms (gc-ms), liquid chromatography-tandem ms (lc-ms/ms), and capillary electrophoresis-ms (ce-ms) metabolomics assays. these findings may make provision for a new set of non-invasive biomarkers for ibs diagnosis and management.",Vakili O; Adibi Sedeh P; Pourfarzam M,2024,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,560,,119753,10.1016/j.cca.2024.119753,"Vakili, O., Adibi Sedeh, P., & Pourfarzam, M.

33853113,Identification Of Three Novel Susceptibility Loci For Inflammatory Bowel Disease In Koreans In An Extended Genome-Wide Association Study.,"background and aims: genome-wide association studies [gwas] of inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] in multiple populations have identified over 240 susceptibility loci. we previously performed a largest-to-date asian-specific ibd gwas to identify two new ibd risk loci and confirm associations with 28 established loci. to identify additional susceptibility loci in asians, we expanded our previous study design by doubling the case size with an additional dataset of 1726 cases and 378 controls.
methods: an inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed between the previous and the new gwas dataset, comprising a total of 3195 cases and 4419 controls, followed by replication in an additional 1088 cases and 845 controls.
results: the meta-analysis of korean gwas identified one novel locus for ulcerative colitis at rs76227733 on 10q24 [pcombined = 6.56 × 10-9] and two novel loci for crohn's disease [cd] at rs2240751 on 19p13 [pcombined = 3.03 × 10-8] and rs6936629 on 6q22 [pcombined = 3.63 × 10-8]. pathway-based analysis of gwas data using magma showed that the mhc and antigenic stimulus-related pathways were more significant in korean cd, whereas cytokine and transcription factor-related pathways were more significant in european cd. phenotype variance explained by the polygenic risk scores derived from korean data explained up to 14% of the variance of cd whereas those derived from european data explained 10%, emphasizing the need for large-scale genetic studies in this population.

aim: to systematically examine the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (ai) models applied to various biomarkers in ibs diagnosis.
methods: a comprehensive search of six databases identified 18053 articles published up to may 31, 2024. following screening and eligibility criteria, six observational studies involving 1366 participants from the united kingdom, china, and japan were included. risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2, prediction model risk of bias assessment tool-ai, and transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis-ai tools. key metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (auc).
results: the included studies applied ai models such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks to biomarkers like fecal microbiome composition, gas chromatography data, neuroimaging features, and protease activity. diagnostic accuracy ranged from 54% to 98% (auc: 0.61-0.99). models using fecal microbiome data achieved the highest performance, with one study reporting 98% sensitivity and specificity (auc = 0.99). while most studies demonstrated high methodological quality, significant variability in datasets, biomarkers, and validation methods limited meta-analysis feasibility and generalizability.

recent findings: very little good quality data or publications are available in recent medical literature. it is therefore difficult to estimate that the low fodmap diet can be considered with a good level of confidence outside of ibs except in borderline symptomatic forms or with associated pathophysiology (e.g. ibd: inflammatory bowel disease).
summary: there is a lack of quality data on the benefits, safety and value of lfd, outside of ibs. this is particularly the case in the majority of organic digestive diseases, notably with diarrhea, unless accompanied by dysregulation of the intestine-brain axis (and so with ibs symptoms), for example in post-inflammatory situations. when effective, which is currently highly unpredictable, the mechanism of action remains poorly understood.",Crenn P,2025,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,28,5,422-426,10.1097/MCO.0000000000001141,"Crenn, P.

methods: a two-sample mr analysis was implemented to assess the causality of blood metabolites on ibs. the study utilized a genome-wide association study (gwas) to examine 486 metabolites as the exposure variable while employing a gwas study with 486,601 individuals of european descent as the outcome variable. the inverse-variance weighted (ivw) method was used to estimate the causal relationship of metabolites on ibs, while several methods were performed to eliminate the pleiotropy and heterogeneity. another gwas data was used for replication and meta-analysis. in addition, reverse mr and linkage disequilibrium score regression (ldsc) were employed for additional assessment. multivariable mr analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the direct impact of metabolites on ibs.
results: three known and two unknown metabolites were identified as being associated with the development of ibs. higher levels of butyryl carnitine (or(95%ci):1.10(1.02-1.18),p = 0.009) and tetradecanedioate (or(95%ci):1.13(1.04-1.23),p = 0.003)increased susceptibility of ibs and higher levels of stearate(18:0)(or(95%ci):0.72(0.58-0.89),p = 0.003) decreased susceptibility of ibs.

objectives: to evaluate the benefits and safety profile of fmt for treatment of ibd in adults and children versus autologous fmt, placebo, standard medication, or no intervention.
search methods: we searched central, medline, embase, two clinical trial registries, and the reference sections of published trials through 22 december 2022.
selection criteria: we included randomized controlled trials that studied adults and children with uc or cd. eligible intervention arms used fmt, defined as the delivery of healthy donor stool containing gut microbiota to a recipient's gi tract, to treat uc or cd.
data collection and analysis: two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. our primary outcomes were: 1. induction of clinical remission, 2. maintenance of clinical remission, and 3. serious adverse events. our secondary outcomes were: 4. any adverse events, 5. endoscopic remission, 6. quality of life, 7. clinical response, 8. endoscopic response, 9. withdrawals, 10. inflammatory markers, and 11. microbiome outcomes. we used the grade approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

authors' conclusions: fmt may increase the proportion of people with active uc who achieve clinical and endoscopic remission. the evidence was very uncertain about whether use of fmt in people with active uc impacted the risk of serious adverse events or improvement in quality of life. the evidence was also very uncertain about the use of fmt for maintenance of remission in people with uc, as well as induction and maintenance of remission in people with cd, and no conclusive statements could be made in this regard. further studies are needed to address the beneficial effects and safety profile of fmt in adults and children with active uc and cd, as well as its potential to promote longer-term maintenance of remission in uc and cd.",Imdad A; Pandit NG; Zaman M; Minkoff NZ; Tanner-Smith EE; Gomez-Duarte OG; Acra S; Nicholson MR,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,4,CD012774,10.1002/14651858.CD012774.pub3,"Imdad, A., Pandit, N.

35306551,Mefv Mutations In Ibd Patients: A Systematic Review And Meta- Analysis.,"background and aims: several studies have suggested that mutations in mefv, the gene responsible for familial mediterranean fever (fmf), are frequently detected in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. we aimed to provide further evidence regarding a potential correlation between mefv gene mutations and ibd by identifying all relevant studies and analyzing their results.
methods: embase, pubmed/medline, and google scholar were used to identify all studies that published until january 2021 and reported mefv mutation patterns in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc), crohn's disease (cd) and indeterminate colitis (ic) with or without a control group. the newcastle-ottawa quality assessment scale was used to appraise the quality of the included studies.
results: thirteen observational studies, including 937 patients and 977 controls, were analyzed. mefv mutation rate in ibd patients was 0.238 (95%ci: 0.209-0.270; i 2 =95%); mefv mutated alleles were more frequent in ibd patients when compared with controls (p=0.03 for uc, p=0.01 for cd and ic). subgroup analysis indicated that mefv mutations were increased in patients with ic when compared with uc and cd (i 2 =91%, p<0.001). patients with extra-intestinal manifestations and pancolitis had 2.57 (95%ci 1.07-6.14; p=0.03) and 2.02 (95%ci: 1.01-4.04, p=0.049) odds ratios to carry mefv mutant genotypes, respectively. exon 10 mutations had the most serious impact. no source of heterogeneity was detected.
conclusions: mefv mutations are common in ibd and are linked with the presence of extra-intestinal manifestations and pancolitis. further research to assess the clinical significance and evolutionary significance of mefv mutations in ibd patients is warranted.",Papadopoulos VP; Antoniadou C; Ritis K; Skendros P,2022,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,31,1,85-97,10.15403/jgld-4070,"Papadopoulos, V.

35998097,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Peripheral Blood Dna Methylation Studies In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"background and aims: over the past decade, the dna methylome has been increasingly studied in peripheral blood of inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] patients. however, a comprehensive summary and meta-analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte [pbl] dna methylation studies has thus far not been conducted. here, we systematically reviewed all available literature up to february 2022 and summarized the observations by means of meta-analysis.
methods: we conducted a systematic search and critical appraisal of ibd-associated dna methylation studies in pbl using the biomarker-based cross-sectional studies [biocross] tool. subsequently, we performed meta-analyses on the summary statistics obtained from epigenome-wide association studies [ewas] that included patients with crohn's disease [cd], ulcerative colitis [uc] and/or healthy controls [hc].
results: altogether, we included 15 studies for systematic review. critical appraisal revealed large methodological and outcome heterogeneity between studies. summary statistics were obtained from four studies based on a cumulative 552 samples [177 cd, 132 uc and 243 hc]. consistent differential methylation was identified for 256 differentially methylated probes [dmps; bonferroni-adjusted p ≤ 0.05] when comparing cd with hc and 103 when comparing uc with hc. comparing ibd [cd + uc] with hc resulted in 224 dmps. importantly, several of the previously identified dmps, such as vmp1/tmem49/mir21 and rps6ka2, were consistently differentially methylated across all studies.
conclusion: methodological homogenization of ibd epigenetic studies is needed to allow for easier aggregation and independent validation. nonetheless, we were able to confirm previous observations. our results can serve as the basis for future ibd epigenetic biomarker research in pbl.",Joustra V; Hageman IL; Satsangi J; Adams A; Ventham NT; de Jonge WJ; Henneman P; D'Haens GR; Li Yim AYF,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,2,185-198,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac119,"Joustra, V., Hageman, I.

35092169,Multiple Sclerosis And Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: multiple sclerosis (ms) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are two autoimmune diseases that seriously affect patients' quality of life. previous studies have established an association between ms and ibd, including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), but the results were inconsistent. the aim of this study was to quantify the prevalences of and the association between ms and ibd.
methods: the pubmed, web of science, and embase databases were searched through november 2020 for studies reporting data on ms among patients with ibd and vice versa. the main outcomes were the proportion of ms in patients with ibd and vice versa, as well as the association (risk ratio [rr]) of ibd in ms and that of ms in ibd.
results: based on the analysis of 17 studies, the prevalence of ms in patients with ibd was 0.2% (95% ci 0.1-0.4%), while the prevalence of ibd in patients with ms was 0.6% (95% ci 0.4-0.9%). patients with ms had a higher prevalence of ibd than controls (rr = 1.53, 95% ci 1.38-1.70, p < 0.00001). there was a similarly high risk of developing cd (rr 1.41, 95% ci 1.14-1.74, p = 0.001) or uc (rr 1.42, 95% ci 1.17-1.71, p = 0.0003) in patients with ms (p for subgroup differences: 0.97). patients with ibd had a higher prevalence of ms than controls (rr = 1.91, 95% ci 1.06-3.45, p = 0.03).

objective: this study aimed to systematically evaluate all previous studies that used vdz sc formulation for maintenance therapy in patients with ibd.
design: systematic review and meta-analysis.
data sources and methods: the search was conducted using the subject and free terms related to 'vedolizumab', 'subcutaneous', and 'ibd', in embase, pubmed, web of science, cochrane, and at clinicaltrials.gov databases between 2008 and 2022. the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (rcts) and cohort studies was assessed using the cochrane handbook of systematic reviews and the newcastle-ottawa scale, respectively. the endpoints included efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.
results: a total of 60 studies and 2 completed clinical registry trials were retrieved, of which 3 rcts with high methodological quality, and 3 cohort studies with large heterogeneity were included in the meta-analysis. in the rct study design, patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) under different conditions after treated with vdz sc were significantly distinct than those for placebo (pbo) in clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and biochemical remission. in crohn's disease (cd), the aforementioned parameters were slightly higher than those for pbo, but there was not statistically significant in endoscopic remission and the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-naive patients. the clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and biochemical remission in patients with uc after vdz sc treatment were similar to those after intravenous (iv) treatment. the risk ratios in patients experiencing adverse events (aes) and serious aes after vdz sc and pbo treatments were 86% and 89% in uc, and 96% and 80% in cd, respectively. compared with iv, safety was not statistically different. the risk of developing anti-vdz antibody after vdz sc treatment was only 20% of that after pbo in patients with uc, but it was 9.38 times in cd.
conclusion: vdz sc treatment maintained the clinical efficacy of iv induction in patients with ibd without increasing the safety risk, and the efficacy was more pronounced in patients with uc. immunogenicity might be a potential factor for the decrease in efficacy rate in patients with ibd.

32115645,A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Incidence And Prevalence Across Europe.,"background and aims: inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] is often one of the most devastating and debilitating chronic gastrointestinal disorders in children and adolescents. the main objectives here were to systematically review the incidence and prevalence of paediatric ibd across all 51 european states.
methods: we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis based on pubmed, cinahl, the cochrane library, searches of reference lists, grey literature and websites, covering the period from 1970 to 2018.
results: incidence rates for both paediatric crohn's disease [cd] and ulcerative colitis [uc] were higher in northern europe than in other european regions. there have been large increases in the incidence of both paediatric cd and uc over the last 50 years, which appear widespread across europe. the largest increases for cd have been reported from sweden, wales, england, the czech republic, denmark and hungary, and for uc from the czech republic, ireland, sweden and hungary. incidence rates for paediatric cd have increased up to 9 or 10 per 100 000 population in parts of europe, including scandinavia, while rates for paediatric uc are often slightly lower than for cd. prevalence reported for cd ranged from 8.2 per 100 000 to approximately 60 and, for uc, from 8.3 to approximately 30.

methods: this study was conducted based on prisma guidelines. the web of science, pubmed, google scholar, and scopus databases were searched up to february 2024 using pertinent keywords. case series, review articles, and animal studies were excluded. the risk of bias in this research was evaluated through the joanna briggs institute (jbi) criteria. the meta-analysis was conducted using r statistical software.
results: a total of 9134 patients within 13 studies after the screening process were evaluated. our study has shown that periodontitis is significantly more prevalent among ibd patients (uc and cd). according to prior meta-analyses, pd morbidity was found to be significantly high among cd patients (or: 4.30; 95% ci: 3.72-4.98; i2 = 0%). similarly, uc elevated pd risk (or: 4.55; 95% ci: 3.76-5.50; i2 = 0%). the risk of periodontitis was not significantly different between cd and uc patients (or: 0.96; 95% ci: 0.65-1.43; i2 = 34%).
conclusions: uc and cd patients were more likely to develop periodontitis, with low heterogeneity between studies, while the prevalence of periodontitis among uc and cd patients was not meaningfully different.
clinical relevance: the higher risk of periodontitis in patients with ibd indicates the necessity of screening for periodontitis. considering the various oral manifestations and poor quality of life associated with ibd, it is important to be aware of the symptoms of periodontitis.",Ayati A; Khodabandelu S; Khaleghi S; Nourmohammadi A; Jafari F; Ahmadianghalehsorkh M; Vatani Z; Bashiri HS; Ahmadi M; Jafari M; Soltaninejad H; Rahmanian M,2025,BMC oral health,25,1,463,10.1186/s12903-025-05830-9,"Ayati, A., Khodabandelu, S., Khaleghi, S., Nourmohammadi, A., Jafari, F., Ahmadianghalehsorkh, M., Vatani, Z., Bashiri, H.

33790618,Metalloproteinases In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing two main disorders: crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). in both these pathologies, excessive and local immune response against luminal antigens promotes a pathological process leading to various degrees of gut damage. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are a family of neutral proteases with the ability to degrade all components of extracellular matrix. in physiological conditions, mmps are produced at very low level and generally in the latent form and are involved in the normal tissue turnover. their function is inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps). however, in inflamed tissue of ibd patients, mmps are produced in excess and/or the activity of timps is not sufficient to block mmps, thereby making a major contribution to the ibd-related mucosal degradation. in this review, we summarize the available evidence on the expression and role of mmps in ibd.",Marônek M; Marafini I; Gardlík R; Link R; Troncone E; Monteleone G,2021,Journal of inflammation research,14,,1029-1041,10.2147/JIR.S288280,"Marônek, M., Marafini, I., Gardlík, R., Link, R., Troncone, E., & Monteleone, G.

34298111,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Implications In Pathogenesis And Therapeutic Targets.,"crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) are the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). among the various immune cells involved in ibd, neutrophils are the first to infiltrate and appear to contribute to the impairment of the epithelial barrier, destruction of tissues by oxidative and proteolytic damage, as well as to the perpetuation of inflammation by the release of cytokines and chemokines associated with pro-inflammatory effects. in addition to basic effector mechanisms, such as phagocytosis and chemotaxis, neutrophils can also form extracellular traps (nets), which is made up of a mesh-like structure - which contains its chromatin (dna + histones) together with granules and enzymes, such as myeloperoxidase (mpo) and neutrophilic elastase (ne) - and that acts as a trap that can result in the death of extracellular pathogens and/or can promote tissue damage. recent evidence indicates that nets also play an important and significant role in the pathogenesis of ibd. previous studies have reported increased levels of nets in tissue and serum samples from patients with ibd, as well as in experimental colitis. in this review, we discuss current knowledge about the formation of nets and their role in the pathophysiology of ibd, pointing out potential mechanisms by which nets promote tissue damage, as well as their involvement in complications associated with ibd. in addition, we propose potential targets for therapy to regulate the production of nets, making it possible to expand the current spectrum of therapies for ibd.",Dos Santos Ramos A; Viana GCS; de Macedo Brigido M; Almeida JF,2021,Pharmacological research,171,,105779,10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105779,"Dos Santos Ramos, A., Viana, G.

37739718,Systematic Review: Sarcopenia In Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"background: low skeletal muscle mass (mm) and deteriorated function (sarcopenia) can be a frequent complication in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
aim: to conduct a systematic review of the paediatric ibd literature on skeletal muscle function and mass and identify interventions that could affect them.
methods: systematic searches (embase, medline, cochrane library central for registered control trials and web of science) were conducted using the terms 'lean body mass' (lm), 'fat free mass' (ffm) or 'mm' and 'ibd'.
results: fourteenth studies were included, presenting data from 439 crohn's disease (cd), 139 ulcerative colitis (uc) and 2 ibd-unclassified participants compared with healthy matched or unmatched groups or reference populations. six out of 14 studies reported lower lm, whilst 7 studies observed lower mm and ffm in cd patients compared to healthy controls. research in uc patients reported lower lm in 3 studies, lower mm in 3 studies and lower ffm in 4 studies. three prospective studies measured the impact of enteral feeding and showed improvement on disease activity and lm or ffm, while one retrospective study did not show any impact on lm.
conclusion: despite the variety of experimental approaches and methods used to assess sarcopenia, most studies showed reduction in mm, lm and ffm in ibd. nutritional intervention may have a positive effect on lm and ffm. future research should focus on standardizing the terminology and methodologies used in assessing body composition and investigating sarcopenia in diseased and matched healthy control cohorts in adequately powered studies with a longitudinal design.",Aljilani B; Tsintzas K; Jacques M; Radford S; Moran GW,2023,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,57,,647-654,10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.08.009,"Aljilani, B., Tsintzas, K., Jacques, M., Radford, S., & Moran, G.

36730088,Systematic Review Of Diagnostic Delay For Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"objectives: pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a complex inflammatory condition of the gut. diagnosing ibd involves distinct longitudinal periods from first symptoms to primary care assessment, tertiary care referral, and then endoscopic confirmation. the term diagnostic delay (dd) is used if these periods are prolonged. the aim of this review was to amalgamate dd data for children with ibd, and identify factors associated with prolonged dd.
methods: six health literature databases were searched (december 2020). inclusion criteria for papers were children diagnosed with ibd before the age of 18 years, dd central tendency data, and to report a central tendency of their dd data, cohort >10 children. for analysis, all data were weighted by cohort sample size.
results: searches identified 236 papers, and 26 were included in the final analysis with a pooled cohort of 7030 children. the overall dd periods were ibd 4.5 months [interquartile range (iqr) 3.6-8.7 months], crohn disease (cd) 5 months (iqr 4-7.2 months), and ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis/ibd-unclassified (uc/ic/ibdu) 3 months (iqr 2.2-4.9 months). the difference between subtypes was significant ( p < 0.001), with shorter dd for uc/ic/ibdu than cd ( p < 0.001) and ibd ( p < 0.001). dd periods were longer for cd than ibd ( p < 0.001). dd decreased over time for ibd ( p < 0.001) and uc ( p < 0.001) but the trend suggested an increase for cd ( p 0.069).

36411558,Modeling Inflammatory Bowel Disease By Intestinal Organoids.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic and relapsing disease caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. ibd encompasses two major clinical entities: ulcerative colitis (uc), limited to the colonic mucosa, and crohn's disease (cd), which might affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. despite the prevalence of ibd increasing worldwide, therapy remains suboptimal, largely because of the variability of causative mechanisms, raising the need to develop individualized therapeutic approaches targeted to each individual patient. in this context, patients-derived intestinal organoids represent an effective tool for advancing our understanding of ibd's pathogenesis. organoid 3d culture systems offer a unique model for dissecting epithelial mechanisms involved ibds and testing individualized therapy, although the lack of a functional immune system and a microbiota, two driving components of the ibd pathogenesis, represent a major barrier to their exploitation in clinical medicine. in this review, we have examined how to improve the translational utility of intestinal organoids in ibd and how co-cultures of 3d or 2d organoids and immune cells and/or intestinal microbiota might help to overcome these limitations.",Di Giorgio C; Roselli R; Biagioli M; Bordoni M; Ricci P; Zampella A; Distrutti E; Donini A; Fiorucci S,2023,Recent advances in inflammation & allergy drug discovery,17,1,39-53,10.2174/2772270817666221121143853,"Di Giorgio, C., Roselli, R., Biagioli, M., Bordoni, M., Ricci, P., Zampella, A., Distrutti, E., Donini, A., & Fiorucci, S.

39403053,Review Article: Measuring Disease Severity In Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Beyond Treat To Target.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) follows a heterogenous disease course and predicting a patient's prognosis is challenging. there is a wide burden of illness in ibd and existing tools measure disease activity at a snapshot in time. comprehensive assessment of ibd severity should incorporate disease activity, prognosis, and the impacts of disease on a patient. this review investigates the concept of disease severity in adults with ibd to highlight key components contributing to this.
methods: to perform this narrative review, a medline search was conducted for full-text articles available at 1st march 2024 using search terms which encompassed disease activity assessment, disease severity, prognosis, natural history of crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), and the burden of ibd.
results: current methods of disease assessment in ibd have evolved from a focus on the burden of symptoms to one that includes inflammatory targets, genetic, serological, and proteomic profiles, and assessments of quality-of-life (qol), disability, and psychosocial health. longitudinal studies of ibd suggest that the burden of illness is driven by disease phenotype, clinical markers of complicated disease course (previous intestinal resection, corticosteroid use, perianal disease in cd, recent hospitalisations in uc), gut inflammation, and the impact of ibd on the patient.
conclusions: disease severity in ibd can be difficult to conceptualise due to the multitude of factors that contribute to ibd outcomes. measurement of ibd severity may better encapsulate the full burden of illness rather than gut inflammation alone at a single timepoint and may be associated with longitudinal outcomes.",Swaminathan A; Day AS; Sparrow MP; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Siegel CA; Gearry RB,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,60,9,1176-1199,10.1111/apt.18231,"Swaminathan, A., Day, A.

methods: we identified 5 cohorts with available transcriptomic data in ileal or colonic samples from active ibd and non-ibd control samples. the meta-analysis was performed on 1047 samples. in each cohort separately, we compared gene expression in cd ileitis and normal ileum; in cd colitis, uc, and normal colon; and finally in pouchitis and normal ileum.
results: we identified specific markers of ileal (folh1, ca2) and colonic (reg3a) inflammation and showed that, with disease, some cells from the ileum start to express colonic markers. we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that these markers were specifically present in ileal or colonic diseases. we highlighted that, overall, colonic cd resembles uc and is distinct from ileal cd, which is in turn closer to pouchitis.
conclusions: we demonstrated that ileal and colonic diseases exhibit specific signatures, independent of their initial clinical classification. this supports molecular, rather than clinical, disease stratification, and may be used to design drugs specifically targeting ileal or colonic diseases.",Perez K; Ngollo M; Rabinowitz K; Hammoudi N; Seksik P; Xavier RJ; Daly MJ; Dotan I; Le Bourhis L; Allez M,2022,Inflammatory bowel diseases,28,5,775-782,10.1093/ibd/izab311,"Perez, K., Ngollo, M., Rabinowitz, K., Hammoudi, N., Seksik, P., Xavier, R.

methods: articles were sourced from embase, medline and cinahl from inception to april 2021. inclusion criteria were adult cohorts (18 ≥ years old) reporting median time periods between onset of symptoms for crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc) or ibd (i.e. cd and uc together) and a final diagnosis (diagnostic delay). narrative synthesis was used to examine the extent of diagnostic delay and characteristics associated with delay. sensitivity analysis was applied by the removal of outliers.
results: thirty-one articles reporting median diagnostic delay for ibd, cd or uc were included. after sensitivity analysis, the majority of ibd studies (7 of 8) reported a median delay of between 2 and 5.3 months. from the studies examining median delay in uc, three-quarters (12 of 16) reported a delay between 2 and 6 months. in contrast, three-quarters of the cd studies (17 of 23) reported a delay of between 2 and 12 months. no characteristic had been examined enough to understand their role in diagnostic delay in these populations.

methods: studies analyzing the incidence of lymphomas in subjects of age >18 years affected by ibd were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. studies focusing on pediatric populations, not reporting person-years of follow-up, or with a duration < 1 year were excluded. pubmed, embase, web of science core collection, and cochrane central register were searched from inception through january 2022. publication bias within studies was assessed using begg's and egger's tests and random effects model. quantitative results were synthesized using relative-risk meta-analysis. prisma guidelines were used to carry out this systematic review (prospero registration number: crd42023398348).
results: a total of 345 studies published between 1985 and 2022, with a total of 6,17,386 patients were included in the meta-analysis. substantial heterogeneity between studies prevented the pooling of estimates (i2 = 97.19%). evidence of publication bias was overall low (p = 0.1941). patients affected by crohn's disease (cd) were 1,86,074 (30.13%), while 2,78,876 (46.17%) were diagnosed with uc. the remaining 23.7% of cases were diagnosed with indeterminate colitis. immunomodulators and biologic therapy were used in 24,520 (5.27%), and 17,972 (3.86%) patients, respectively. reported incidence rates for lymphoma in ibd ranged from 0.0/100,000 person/years (py) (95% ci 0.0-3.7/100,000) to 89/100,000 py (95% ci 36-160/100,000). reported incidence rates of lymphoma in cd ranged from 0.0/100,000 py (95% ci 0.0-3.7/100,000) to 91/100,000 py (95% ci 18-164/100,000). for uc, the incidence rate ranged from 0.0/100,000 py (95% ci 0.0-3.7/100,000) to 95/100,000 py (95% ci 0-226/100,000). male-to-female ratio was ~4:1. therapy with immunomodulators was directly associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma (p < 0.0001). evidence of publication bias was overall low (p = 0 .1941).
conclusions: the evidence arising from this study highlights a correlation between the use of immunomodulators and subsequent lymphoma development. combined multidisciplinary approach and long-term follow-up are warranted in order to decrease mortality deriving from the coexistence of both conditions.

35177326,Ubiquitin-Modifying Enzymes As Regulators Of Colitis.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. although the pathophysiology of ibd is multifaceted, ubiquitination, a post-translational modification, has been shown to have essential roles in its pathogenesis and development. ubiquitin-modifying enzymes (umes) work in synergy to orchestrate the optimal ubiquitination of target proteins, thereby maintaining intestinal homeostasis. genome-wide association studies (gwas) have identified multiple ume genes as ibd susceptibility loci, implying the importance of umes in ibd. furthermore, accumulative evidence demonstrates that umes affect intestinal inflammation by regulating various aspects, such as intestinal barrier functions and immune responses. considering the significant functions of umes in ibd, targeting umes could become a favorable therapeutic approach for ibd.",Ruan J; Schlüter D; Naumann M; Waisman A; Wang X,2022,Trends in molecular medicine,28,4,304-318,10.1016/j.molmed.2022.01.006,"Ruan, J., Schlüter, D., Naumann, M., Waisman, A., & Wang, X.

39348571,Association Between Vedolizumab Treatment And Arthritis/Arthralgia In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and aims: vedolizumab is a humanized gut selective drug that targets α4β7 integrin and has been used successfully in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). pivotal studies have already demonstrated the drug's safety, but some real-life cohorts have shown an increase in arthralgia and arthritis in patients using vedolizumab. these findings raised the question of whether these joint symptoms are extraintestinal manifestations of ibd (since the drug acts only in the gut) or if they are associated with the use of vedolizumab. this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the incidence of arthralgia/arthritis in patients receiving vedolizumab and to investigate whether these events are indeed drug related.
methods: pubmed, cochrane, and scopus were searched for randomized clinical trials reporting the incidence of joint manifestations in patients with crohn's disease (cd) or ulcerative colitis (uc) who were treated with vedolizumab. the considered outcomes were arthritis and arthralgia. we used revman to calculate the pooled incidence of the reported outcomes and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% ci).
results: the search strategy yielded 4,206 articles. after removal of duplicates and screening of results, 6 randomized studies met the inclusion criteria. a total of 3,134 patients with moderately to severe ibd were included. of those, 2,119 were randomized to receive vedolizumab and 1,015 to placebo. in the intervention group, 210 patients developed arthritis or arthralgia of any kind while 84 patients developed those symptoms in the placebo group (rr=1.09; 95%ci: 0.86-1.38; p=0.49, i2=0%), showing no significant association. results also showed no significant association between exposure and the studied outcome after comparing cd (rr=1.02; 95%ci: 0.76-1.37, p=0.89, i2=0%) and uc (rr=1.24; 95%ci: 0.81-1.89, p=0.32, i2=43%) separately.
conclusions: the meta-analysis showed no association of these symptoms to the treatment with vedolizumab. therefore, the new onset of worsening arthritis and arthralgia may be associated with the course of the disease itself, with the body's response to the drugs or with the exclusion of corticosteroids or anti-tnf from concomitant treatment with vedolizumab. further studies with larger sample sizes are required, especially randomized clinical trials comparing anti-tnf, corticosteroid and immunomodulators to evaluate the incidence of joint manifestations in patients with ibd and even other rheumatological manifestations that may be associated as well.",Alves Halpern G; Gomes C; Thaytala Quintino Falcon B; Prigol Dalfovo M; De Carvalho Maia J; Brandão Oliveira D,2024,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,33,3,379-385,10.15403/jgld-5546,"Alves Halpern, G., Gomes, C., Thaytala Quintino Falcon, B., Prigol Dalfovo, M., De Carvalho Maia, J., & Brandão Oliveira, D.

methods: in a systematic review through june 1, 2019, we identified population-based cohort studies of eo ibd reporting the cumulative risk of hospitalization, surgery, mortality, treatment patterns, escalation, and/or malignancy. data were synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis as cumulative risk of events at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, and compared with data from patients with ao ibd in the same cohorts.
results: we identified 9 studies, comprising 14,765 patients with eo ibd. in patients with eo crohn's disease (cd), the cumulative 5-year risk of surgery was 22.6% (95% ci, 18.7-27.2) and was similar to that of patients with ao cd (relative risk [rr], 1.04; 95% ci, 0.80-1.34). overall exposure to corticosteroids was comparable between patients with eo cd vs ao cd (5-year risk: 55.4%; 95% ci, 53.4-57.4; rr, 0.88; 95% ci, 0.78-1.00), but exposure to immunomodulators (31.5%; 95% ci, 29.7-33.4; rr, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.51-0.77) or biologic agents (6.5%; 95% ci, 5.6-7.6; rr, 0.36; 95% ci, 0.25-0.52) was significantly lower for patients with eo cd than for patients with ao cd. similarly, in patients with eo ulcerative colitis (uc), the cumulative 5-year risk of surgery was 7.8% (95% ci, 5.0-12.0), similar to the risk for patients with ao uc (rr, 1.29; 95% ci, 0.79-2.11). overall exposure to corticosteroids was comparable between patients with eo uc vs ao uc (5-year risk: 57.2%; 95% ci, 55.6-58.7; rr, 0.98; 95% ci, 0.91-1.06), but exposure to immunomodulators (16.1%; 95% ci, 15.0-17.2; rr, 0.58; 95% ci, 0.54-0.62) or biologic agents (2.0%; 95% ci, 1.6-2.5; rr, 0.36; 95% ci, 0.24-0.52) was significantly lower for patients with eo uc than for patients with ao uc. patients with eo ibd appeared to have increased mortality, but not malignancy, compared with the general population. there were few data on comorbidities or adverse effects of medications.
conclusions: in a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that patients with eo ibd have a similar risk of surgery as patients with ao ibd. however, patients with eo ibd are less likely to receive treatment with immunomodulators or biologic agents.",Rozich JJ; Dulai PS; Fumery M; Sandborn WJ; Singh S,2020,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,18,11,2437-2447.e6,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.02.048,"Rozich, J.

32585338,Targeting T Cells In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"t cells play a pivotal role in the immune response underlying inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) pathogenesis. on this basis, over the past 25 years several drugs have assessed to target t cells in ibd patients. amongst anti-cd3 antibodies, visilizumab and foralumab did not show clinical efficacy in ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd) patients, respectively, whereas otelixizumab has been tested in vitro only. the anti-cd4 bf-5 and cm-t412, and the anti-cd25 basiliximab and daclizumab were not effective in cd and uc patients, respectively. the anti-nkg2d antibody nnc0142-0002 showed clinical benefit in cd patients, in particular in biologic naïve ones, in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. the anti-cd40l m90 and the gsk1349571a blocking calcium release-activated calcium (crac) channels, which are involved in the t cell activation and proliferation, were tested only in ex vivo/in vitro experiments. apart from ustekinumab, all the other drugs targeting t cell-derived cytokines failed. the reinduction of lamina propria t cell apoptosis is a mechanism to modulate t cell survival exploited by cyclosporin a, azathioprine and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents, such as infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab. in this article, we review the drugs targeting t cells via surface receptors, via t cell-derived cytokines, via crac channels or by inducing apoptosis.",Giuffrida P; Di Sabatino A,2020,Pharmacological research,159,,105040,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105040,"Giuffrida, P., & Di Sabatino, A.

34575326,Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Sarcopenia: Its Mechanism And Clinical Importance.,"malnutrition is a major contributor to muscle loss and muscle dysfunction, known as sarcopenia. malnutrition is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). ibd includes ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). the number of patients with ibd has recently been increasing. more severe malnutrition is often seen in cd compared to uc, probably due to cd affecting the main site of nutrient absorption, extensive mucosal lesions, fistulas, short bowel syndrome after resection, or obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. a recent meta-analysis showed the high prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with ibd, and thus sarcopenia is a very important problem for ibd. although ibd is more common in younger patients, sarcopenia can develop through a variety of mechanisms, including malnutrition, chronic inflammation, increased inflammatory status in adipose tissue, vitamin deficiency, and imbalance of the muscle-gut axis. in addition, sarcopenia has a negative impact on postoperative complications and hospital stay in patients with ibd. appropriate intervention for sarcopenia may be important, in addition to clinical remission and endoscopic mucosal healing in patients with ibd. much more attention will thus be paid to sarcopenia in patients with ibd. in this review, we outline ibd and sarcopenia, based on the current evidence.",Nishikawa H; Nakamura S; Miyazaki T; Kakimoto K; Fukunishi S; Asai A; Nishiguchi S; Higuchi K,2021,Journal of clinical medicine,10,18,,10.3390/jcm10184214,"Nishikawa, H., Nakamura, S., Miyazaki, T., Kakimoto, K., Fukunishi, S., Asai, A., Nishiguchi, S., & Higuchi, K.

36043901,Proteomic And Lipidomic Biomarkers In The Diagnosis And Progression Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease - A Review.,"purpose: there is an increasing prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and to date, no effective treatment has been developed and the exact etiology of this disease remains unknown. nevertheless, a growing number of proteomic and lipidomic studies have identified certain proteins and lipids which can be used successfully in patients to improve diagnoses and monitoring of treatment.
experimental design: we have focused on the applications of proteins and lipids for ibd diagnostics, including differentiation of crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), treatment monitoring, monitoring of clinical state, likelihood of relapse, and their potential for novel targeted treatments.
results: analysis of protein and lipid profiles can: improve the availability and use of diagnostic markers; improve understanding of the pathomechanisms of ibd, for example, several studies have implicated platelet dysfunction (pf4), autoimmune responses (granzyme b, perforin), and abnormal metabolism (arachidonic acid pathways); aid in monitoring patient health; and improve therapeutics (experimental phosphatidylcholine therapy has been shown to result in an improvement in intestinal condition).
conclusions: despite the enormous progress of proteomics and lipidomics in recent years and the development of new technologies, further research is needed to select some of the most sensitive and specific markers applicable in diagnosing and treating ibd.",Cecerska-Heryć E; Ronkowski B; Heryć R; Serwin N; Grygorcewicz B; Roszak M; Galant K; Dołęgowska B,2023,Proteomics.

36150392,The Diagnostic Yield Of Pan-Enteric Capsule Endoscopy In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and aim: capsule endoscopy (ce) is a non-invasive diagnostic modality enabling real time video imaging of the gastrointestinal (gi) mucosa. pan-enteric capsule endoscopy (pce) is now able to thoroughly assess the entire gi tract, including for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pces in ibd.
methods: we comprehensively searched electronic databases (medline, scopus, embase, and cochrane central register of controlled trials) for studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of pce with endoscopic evaluation, intestinal ultrasound or magnetic resonance enterography (mre). data were analyzed by calculating forest plots and the use of the i2 statistic for heterogeneity.
results: fourteen studies were identified, with seven studies evaluating pce diagnostic yield in crohn's disease (cd) and seven studies in ulcerative colitis (uc). in cd, there was a trend to superiority of pce over mre and colonoscopy with a pooled odds ratio (or) of 1.25 (95% ci, 0.85-1.86%) for the detection of cd. this translates to an increased diagnostic yield of 5% and 7% for pce compared with mre and colonoscopy, respectively. pces had a diagnostic sensitivity for the detection of uc of 93.8% (95% ci, 87.6-97.0%) and a specificity of 69.8% (95% ci, 38.2-89.6%).
conclusion: pces have a comparable diagnostic yield to colonoscopy and mre in crohn's disease. the major difficulty remains standardization of pce scoring systems and the lack of transmural assessment. in uc, pce has an excellent diagnostic sensitivity and positive predictive value, but there are limitations to its use including the lack of histologic assessment and poor specificity.",Tamilarasan AG; Tran Y; Paramsothy S; Leong R,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,12,2207-2216,10.1111/jgh.16007,"Tamilarasan, A.

methods: retrospective descriptive analysis including 47 pregnant women with ibd (28 with crohn's disease - cd and 19 with ulcerative colitis - uc) who delivered between march 2012 and july 2018 in a tertiary hospital. we reviewed clinical records to extract demographic information, previous medical history, disease subtype, activity, severity, treatment, and obstetric, puerperal, and neonatal outcome measures.
results: obstetric and neonatal complications (composite outcomes) occurred in 55.3% and 14.6% of the ibd population, respectively, and were more frequent in uc patients. preterm birth (ptb), preeclampsia, anemia, low birth weight (lbw), and neonatal death were also more frequent in uc patients. the rate of postpartum hemorrhage (pph) was 14.9%, and it was higher in cd patients. women with active ibd had more obstetric/neonatal adverse outcomes (fetal growth restriction and lbw in particular) and cesarean sections. patients with medicated ibd had less obstetric/neonatal complications (ptb and lbw in specific) and cesarean sections but more pph.
conclusion: women with ibd may have an increased risk of obstetric/puerperal/neonatal adverse outcomes. ulcerative colitis patients had more obstetric and neonatal complications, whereas pph was more frequent if cd patients. other disease characteristics were considered, which allowed a better understanding of their possible influence. although more research is needed, this work reinforces the importance of adequate surveillance to allow prompt recognition and treatment of complications.",Costa RV; Simões C; Correia L; Pinto L,2022,Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,44,10,915-924,10.1055/s-0042-1756149,"Costa, R.

A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"introduction: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), encompassing crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), exhibits a multifactorial pathogenesis influenced by genetic and environmental factors. antibiotic usage has been implicated in modifying the gut microbiome, potentially leading to dysbiosis and contributing to ibd risk. despite existing literature, the relationship remains inconclusive. this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between prior antibiotic use and the onset of ibd.
methods: a systematic literature search in pubmed was conducted to identify studies exploring the link between antibiotic use and subsequent ibd diagnosis. studies reporting cd, uc, or both as primary outcomes were included. the meta-analysis, performed according to prisma guidelines, summarized risk estimates, represented as odds ratios (ors), and corresponding confidence intervals (cis). subgroup analyses involved the categorization of antibiotics and the determination of the minimum number of antibiotic therapy courses administered.
results: out of 722 publications, 31 studies comprising 102,103 individuals met eligibility criteria. the pooled or for ibd in those with prior antibiotic exposure was 1.40 (95% ci: 1.25-1.56). antibiotic use was associated with an increased risk of ibd (or: 1.52, 95% ci: 1.19-1.94). notably, this association was confined to cd (or: 1.50, 95% ci: 1.27-1.77), while no significant association was observed with uc (or: 1.21, 95% ci: 1.00-1.47). risk augmentation for ibd correlated positively with the number of antibiotic courses (or: 1.08, 95% ci: 1.05-1.12).
conclusion: previous antibiotic use is associated with the later development of cd. a positive dose-response effect was also observed. against this background, antibiotics should be used rationally.",Scharf E; Schlattmann P; Stallhofer J; Stallmach A,2025,Visceral medicine,41,1,32-47,10.1159/000541601,"Scharf, E., Schlattmann, P., Stallhofer, J., & Stallmach, A.

33666710,Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Its Relationship With The Microbiome.,"paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract, comprising of crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc), and, where classification is undetermined, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (ibdu). paediatric ibd incidence is increasing globally, with prevalence highest in the developed world. though no specific causative agent has been identified for paediatric ibd, it is believed that a number of factors may contribute to the development of the disease, including genetics and the environment. another potential component in the development of ibd is the microbiota in the digestive tract, particularly the gut. while the exact role that the microbiome plays in ibd is unclear, many studies acknowledge the complex relationship between the gut bacteria and pathogenesis of ibd. in this review, we look at the increasing number of studies investigating the role the microbiome and other biomes play in paediatric patients with ibd, particularly changes associated with ibd, varying disease states, and therapeutics. the paediatric ibd microbiome is significantly different to that of healthy children, with decreased diversity and differences in bacterial composition (such as a decrease in firmicutes). changes in the microbiome relating to various treatments of ibd and disease severity have also been observed in multiple studies. changes in diversity and composition may also extend to other biomes in paediatric ibd, such as the virome and the mycobiome. research into biome differences in ibd paediatric patients may help progress our understanding of the aetiology of the disease.",Fitzgerald RS; Sanderson IR; Claesson MJ,2021,Microbial ecology,82,4,833-844,10.1007/s00248-021-01697-9,"Fitzgerald, R.

31252191,Progression Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Throughout Latin America And The Caribbean: A Systematic Review.,"background & aims: the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) is increasing in latin america. we performed a systematic review to identify clinical and epidemiologic features of ibd in latin america (including mexico, central america, and south america) and the caribbean.
methods: we searched medline, embase, and scielo databases for clinical or epidemiologic studies of crohn's disease (cd) or ulcerative colitis (uc) from latin american and caribbean countries and territories that reported incidence, prevalence, ratio of uc:cd, ibd phenotype, and treatment, through september 12, 2018. data were extracted from 61 articles for analysis.
results: the incidence and prevalence of ibd have been steadily increasing in latin america and the caribbean. the incidence of cd in brazil increased from 0.08 per 100,000 person-years in 1988 to 0.68 per 100,000 person-years in 1991-1995 to 5.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2015. the highest reported prevalence of ibd was in argentina, in 2007, at 15 and 82 per 100,000 person-years for cd and uc, respectively. the ratio of uc:cd exceeded 1 in all regions throughout latin america and the caribbean with the exception of brazil. treatment with tumor necrosis factor antagonists increased steadily for patients with cd (43.4% of all patients in brazil were treated in 2014) but less so for patients with uc (4.5% of all patients were treated in 2014). surgery for ibd decreased with time. in chile, surgeries were performed on 57.0% of patients with cd and 18.0% of patients with uc during the period of 1990-2002; these values decreased to 38.0% and 5.0%, respectively, during the period of 2012-2015. in peru, 6.9% of patients with uc received colectomies in the period of 2001-2003 and 6.2% in 2004-2014.
conclusions: in a systematic review, we found the incidence of ibd to be increasing throughout latin america and the caribbean. population-based epidemiology studies are needed to evaluate the increase in ibd in these regions, which differ from other global regions in climate, culture, demographics, diet, healthcare delivery and infrastructure, and socioeconomic status.",Kotze PG; Underwood FE; Damião AOMC; Ferraz JGP; Saad-Hossne R; Toro M; Iade B; Bosques-Padilla F; Teixeira FV; Juliao-Banos F; Simian D; Ghosh S; Panaccione R; Ng SC; Kaplan GG,2020,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,18,2,304-312,10.1016/j.cgh.2019.06.030,"Kotze, P.

35581968,Risk Of Venous Thromboembolism In Children And Adolescents With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: a two- to three-fold increased risk of venous thrombotic events (vte) has been demonstrated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) compared to the general population, but less is known about the risk of vte in child- and pediatric-onset ibd. in recent years, several studies have reported the rising incidence rate of vte in juvenile patients with ibd, and the related risk factors have been explored.
aim: to evaluate the risk of vte in children and adolescents with ibd.
methods: articles published up to april 2021 were retrieved from pubmed, embase, cochrane library, web of science, sinomed, cnki, and wanfang. data from observational studies and clinical work were extracted. the outcome was the occurrence of vte according to the type of ibd. the available odds ratio (or) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (ci) were extracted to compare the outcomes. effect size (p), odds ratio (or), and 95%ci were used to assess the association between vte risk and ibd disease. subgroup analyses stratified by subtypes of vte and ibd were performed.
results: twelve studies (7450272 ibd patients) were included in the meta-analysis. child and adolescent ibd patients showed increased vte risk (p = 0.02, 95%ci: 0.01-0.03). subgroup analyses stratified by ibd (ulcerative colitis (uc): p = 0.05, 95%ci: 0.03-0.06; crohn's disease (cd): p = 0.02, 95%ci: 0.00-0.04) and vte subtypes (portal vein thrombosis: p = 0.04, 95%ci: 0.02-0.06; deep vein thrombosis: p = 0.03, 95%ci: 0.01-0.05; central venous catheter-related thrombosis: p = 0.23, 95%ci: 0.00-0.46; thromboembolic events: p = 0.02, 95%ci: 0.01-0.03) revealed a significant correlation between vte risk and ibd. patients with ibd were more susceptible to vte risk than those without ibd (or = 2.99, 95%ci: 1.45-6.18). the funnel plot was asymmetric, suggesting the presence of significant publication bias. pediatric and adolescent ibd patients have an increased vte risk. uc and cd patients exhibited a high risk of vte. the risk of vte subtypes was increased in ibd patients.
conclusion: the current meta-analysis showed that the incidence and risk of vte are significantly increased in pediatric and adolescent ibd patients. thus, ibd might be a risk factor for vte in children and young adults. high-quality prospective cohort studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",Zhang XY; Dong HC; Wang WF; Zhang Y,2022,World journal of gastroenterology,28,16,1705-1717,10.3748/wjg.v28.i16.1705,"Zhang, X.

38584861,Microbiota Therapy In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"background: in both crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) the immune reaction is - at least partially - directed against components of the luminal microbiota of the gut. these immune responses as well as other factors contribute to a phenomenon frequently described as ""dysbiosis"" meaning an alteration of the composition of the colonic microbiota. to improve the dysbiosis and to restore the normal composition of the colonic microbiota, fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) has been tested as a therapeutic option to induce and maintain remission in ibd patients.
summary: this review will first discuss changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota found in ibd patients and second the therapeutic potential of microbiological interventions for the treatment of these patients. fmt has been studied in several clinical trials in both, cd and uc. reported results and subsequent meta-analyses indicate that fmt may be effective to induce remission in uc. however, the optimal route of fmt, the necessary number of administrations and the question whether life bacteria of freshly prepared stool is more effective than frozen are still unclear. concepts associated with an optimization of fmt such as the ""super donor concept"" or the ""consortia-approach"" will be discussed to illustrate open questions and difficulties associated with microbiota therapy in ibd.
key messages: the microbiota composition in ibd patients shows significant alterations compared to healthy individuals termed as ""dysbiosis"". fmt and other therapeutic approaches to modify the microbiota composition have been studied in clinical trials in recent years. efficacy has been shown in uc; however, many questions with respect to the optimization of microbiota therapy remain to be answered.",Biedermann L; Kreienbühl A; Rogler G,2024,Visceral medicine,40,2,92-101,10.1159/000536254,"Biedermann, L., Kreienbühl, A., & Rogler, G.

32929762,Prevalence Of The Pathobiont Adherent-Invasive Escherichia Coli And Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and aim: escherichia coli pathobionts and particularly the adherent-invasive e. coli (aiec) may play a putative role in initiating and maintaining the inflammatory process in the intestinal tissues of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients, by providing stimulatory factors that trigger gut immune system activation. the aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of aiec among patients with crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc).
methods: electronic databases were searched up to february 2020 for relevant publications reporting the prevalence of aiec in ibd patients. the prevalence rate of aiec among cd and uc patients, the odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (ci) were calculated compared to non-ibd controls.
results: the final dataset included 12 studies, all investigating aiec isolates from ileal/colonic specimens. the or for prevalence of aiec in cd patients was 3.27 (95% ci 1.79-5.9) compared with non-ibd controls. the overall pooled prevalence of aiec among cd patients was 29% (95% ci 0.17-0.45), whereas this prevalence was calculated to be 9% (95% ci 0.03-0.19) in controls. moreover, the prevalence of aiec in uc subjects was calculated 12% (95% ci 0.01-0.34), while aiec showed a prevalence of 5% (95% ci 0.0-0.17) among the controls. the or for prevalence of aiec in uc patients was 2.82 (95% ci 1.11-7.14) compared with controls.
conclusions: there is a substantial increase in the prevalence of aiec in ibd patients compared with controls. this review supports the growing evidence that aiec could be involved in both cd and uc pathogenesis.",Nadalian B; Yadegar A; Houri H; Olfatifar M; Shahrokh S; Asadzadeh Aghdaei H; Suzuki H; Zali MR,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,4,852-863,10.1111/jgh.15260,"Nadalian, B., Yadegar, A., Houri, H., Olfatifar, M., Shahrokh, S., Asadzadeh Aghdaei, H., Suzuki, H., & Zali, M.

35288834,Diagnostic Delay In Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"introduction: delays in diagnosing pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are common, but the extent of this delay remains unclear due to variations in reported time-periods between studies. the objectives of this systematic review were to examine the extent of diagnostic delay in pediatric ibd and examine any association between specific characteristics and length of diagnostic delay.
methods: we identified studies from several medical bibliographical databases (embase, medline and cinahl) from their inception to april 2021. studies examining pediatric cohorts (< 18 years old) defined as having a diagnosis of crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc), or by the more general definition of ibd, and reporting a median time-period between the onset of symptoms and a final diagnosis (diagnostic delay) were included. two reviewers selected each study, extracted data, and assessed their quality using the newcastle-ottawa scale. narrative synthesis was then used to examine the extent of overall diagnostic delay and delay associated with specific sample characteristics.
results: of the 10,119 studies initially identified, 24 were included in the review. the overall median diagnostic delay range was 2-10.4 months for ibd, 2.0-18.0 months for uc and 4.0-24.0 months for cd. however, for approximately two thirds of uc (68.8%) and cd (66.7%) studies, delay ranged from 2.0-3.0 and 4.0-6.3 months, respectively. a longer delay was significantly associated with several sample characteristics; however, these were too infrequently examined to draw robust conclusion on their role.
conclusion: children continue to wait several months for a final diagnosis of ibd, and those with cd experience longer delay than those with uc. the role of specific characteristics on delay needs further exploration.",Ajbar A; Cross E; Matoi S; Hay CA; Baines LM; Saunders B; Farmer AD; Prior JA,2022,Digestive diseases and sciences,67,12,5444-5454,10.1007/s10620-022-07452-5,"Ajbar, A., Cross, E., Matoi, S., Hay, C.

33436549,The Role Of The Hippo Pathway In The Pathogenesis Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disorder that primarily comprises crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). owing to its increasing prevalence in eastern countries and the intractable challenges faced during ibd treatment, extensive research on ibd has been carried out over the last few years. although the precise aetiology of ibd is undefined, the currently accepted hypothesis for ibd pathogenesis considers it to be a combination of environment, genetic predisposition, gut microbiota, and abnormal immunity. a recently emerged signalling pathway, the hippo pathway, acts as a key regulator of cell growth, tissue homoeostasis, organ size, and has been implicated in several human cancers. in the past few years, studies have revealed the importance of the hippo pathway in gastrointestinal tract physiology and gastrointestinal diseases, such as colorectal cancer and ibd. however, the role of the hippo pathway and its exact impact in ibd remains to be elucidated. this review summarises the latest scientific literature on the involvement of this pathway in ibd from the following perspectives that account for the ibd pathogenesis: intestinal epithelial cell regeneration, immune regulation, gut microbiota, and angiogenesis. a comprehensive understanding of the specific role of the hippo pathway in ibd will provide novel insights into future research directions and clinical implications of the hippo pathway.",Xie Z; Wang Y; Yang G; Han J; Zhu L; Li L; Zhang S,2021,Cell death & disease,12,1,79,10.1038/s41419-021-03395-3,"Xie, Z., Wang, Y., Yang, G., Han, J., Zhu, L., Li, L., & Zhang, S.

34876831,Indeterminate Colitis - Update On Treatment Options.,"indeterminate colitis (ic) is described in approximately 5-15% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). it usually reflects a difficulty or lack of clarity in distinguishing between ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd) on biopsy or colectomy specimens. the diagnostic difficulty may explain the variability in the reported prevalence and incidence of ic. clinically, most ic patients tend to evolve over time to a definite diagnosis of either uc or cd. ic has also been interchangeably described as inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (ibdu). this review offers an overview of the available limited literature on the conventional medical and surgical treatments for ic. in contrast to the numerous studies on the medical management of uc and cd, there are very few data from dedicated controlled trials on the treatment of ic. the natural evolution of ic more closely mimics uc. regarding medical options for treatment, most patients diagnosed with ic are treated similarly to uc, and treatment choices are based on disease severity. others are managed similarly to cd if there are features suggestive of cd, including fissures, skin tags, or rectal sparing. in medically refractory ic, surgical treatment options are limited and include total proctocolectomy (tpc) and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (ipaa), with its associated risk factors and complications. post-surgical complications and pouch failure rates were historically thought to be more common in ic patients, but recent meta-analyses reveal similar rates between uc and ic patients. future therapies in ibd are focused on known mechanisms in the disease pathways of uc and cd. owing to the lack of ic-specific studies, clinicians have traditionally and historically extrapolated the data to ic patients based on their symptomatology, clinical course, and endoscopic findings.",Venkateswaran N; Weismiller S; Clarke K,2021,Journal of inflammation research,14,,6383-6395,10.2147/JIR.S268262,"Venkateswaran, N., Weismiller, S., & Clarke, K.

36425101,Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Have A Higher Chance Of Developing Periodontitis: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and objective: periodontitis affects up to one billion people worldwide, and has been proven to be associated with several systemic inflammatory conditions. this study investigates the specific relationship between two multifactorial diseases: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and periodontitis. to thoroughly explore this issue, we investigated separately whether ibd patients have a higher chance of developing periodontitis, and equally, whether patients with periodontitis have a higher chance of developing ibd.
methods: the systematic search was performed in three databases: medline, cochrane trials, and embase, up to 26 october 2021. the protocol was registered in prospero. all eligible studies investigating the association between ibd and periodontitis from either direction were included. the newcastle-ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. as a primary outcome, we investigated the prevalence of ibd and periodontitis, and calculated the odds ratio (or). our secondary outcomes involved comparing the clinical periodontal outcomes of ibd patients to those of ibd-free patients.
results: the systematic search resulted in 1,715 records, 14 of which were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 8 for quantitative synthesis. on the basis of the results of the primary outcome, ibd diagnosis was associated with significantly higher odds of periodontitis: or = 2.65 (ci: 2.09-3.36, i 2 = 0 (ci: 0-0.75)). for subgroup analysis, we investigated separately the odds in crohn's disease (cd) patients: or = 2.22 (ci: 1.49-3.31, i 2 = 0.05 (ci: 0-0.76)) and in ulcerative colitis (uc) patients: or = 3.52 (ci: 2.56 to 4.83, i 2 = 0 (ci: 0-0.75)); the odds were significantly higher in all cases. two studies investigated whether patients with periodontitis were more susceptible to ibd, and both found that periodontitis was significantly associated with the risk of subsequent uc, but not with subsequent cd. however, more studies are needed to prove an association.
conclusion: our analysis confirmed that ibd patients have a higher chance of developing periodontitis, and are a higher risk population in dentistry. both dentists and gastroenterologists should be aware of this relationship and should emphasize the importance of prevention even more than in the healthy population.

32959603,Extraintestinal Manifestations Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease In Middle Eastern Patients.,"background and aims: the inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds), crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), are gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders with many extraintestinal manifestations (eims). previously reported incidences of eims in ibd patients have ranged from 10% to 50%. the large variation in occurrence of eims has been linked to genetic predisposition. correlations between individual eims are unclear. therefore, we aim to estimate the incidence of eims in a middle eastern cohort of patients with ibd and examine possible relationships with eims.
patients and methods: we conducted a retrospective study involving all patients included in the king abdulaziz university ibd information system registry between 2013 and 2018. data on demographics, disease characteristics, and eims were extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics: the standard student's t-test and chi-squared test. logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations using stata software version 11.2 (statacorp, tx, usa).
results: we reviewed the electronic medical files of 284 patients with confirmed ibd, of which 158 (55.6%) were females, the mean age was 27.8 (±15) years; 146 (51.4%) patients had cd and 138 (48.6%) uc. the overall incidence risk of eims was 138 (52.3%) over a mean duration of follow up of 7.3 (±3.9) years. the most common eim was arthritis (33%), followed by aphthous ulcers (16%). pyoderma gangrenosum occurred in 8% of patients and appeared to be specific for cd patients (p = 0.002), whereas primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) was more specific for uc (p = 0.001). certain eims appeared to occur together such as arthritis with psc (p = 0.001). regression analysis identified disease type (in favor of uc; odds ratio = 0.50, p = 0.03) and age at the time of diagnosis (odds ratio = 1.04, p = 0.001) as the only significant predictors of eims.

32335670,Relapse From Deep Remission After Therapeutic De-Escalation In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and aims: we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the relapse rate after therapeutic de-escalation in inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] patients who achieved deep remission [dr].
methods: we searched medline, embase, and major gastroenterology conferences up to july 2019 for studies reporting relapse in adult patients with dr who subsequently underwent therapeutic de-escalation. eligible studies defined dr as at least a combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing/endoscopic remission. the primary outcome was cumulative 1-year and 2-year relapse rates after therapeutic de-escalation. secondary outcomes were relapse rates in ulcerative colitis [uc] and crohn's disease [cd], relapse after anti-tumour necrosis factor-α [anti-tnfα] de-escalation, and the rate of disease response recapture following re-escalation.
results: thirteen studies encompassing 837 patients were identified. the cumulative relapse rate after therapeutic de-escalation was 28.7% within 1 year [12 studies], and 38.4% within 2 years [eight studies]. relapse rates within 1 year and 2 years were comparable between uc [five studies; 25.4% and 37.4%] and cd [seven studies; 34.1% and 39.9%]. ten studies reported de-escalation of anti-tnfα, of which 29.8% patients relapsed within 1 year and 41.4% within 2 years. response recapture following re-escalation [eight studies] was 75.4%.
conclusions: despite achieving deep remission, therapeutic de-escalation in this patient population is associated with significant relapse risk within 1 year and 2 years. this risk is more pronounced in patients requiring anti-tnfα for management, likely because of more severe disease. similar rates of relapse were reported among uc and cd within these time periods. these findings suggest that combined clinical and endoscopic remission should not be an impetus to consider therapeutic de-escalation.",Zhang B; Gulati A; Alipour O; Shao L,2020,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,14,10,1413-1423,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa087,"Zhang, B., Gulati, A., Alipour, O., & Shao, L.

32452591,Review Article: Withdrawal Of 5-Aminosalicylates In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"background: 5-aminosalicylates (5-asa) are widely used in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), but emerging evidence suggests that they may be safely withdrawn in significant subsets of patients. this is important to address: 5-asa therapy accounts for up to 25% of total healthcare costs in ulcerative colitis (uc), while almost a third of patients with crohn's disease (cd) receive long-term 5-asa despite no clear evidence of benefit. further, rationalising medication burden may improve overall adherence and outcome.
aims: to summarise the rationale for 5-asa withdrawal, review the current evidence in both uc and cd and consider the data surrounding colorectal cancer (crc) prevention, guiding an evidence-based withdrawal strategy.
methods: pubmed was searched to identify relevant studies. only papers published in english were reviewed, with priority given to randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses.
results: for patients with uc, consideration of 5-asa withdrawal should be made on a case-by-case basis, but it appears safest for those in deep remission without any of the following risk factors: younger age (<40 years), remission for less than 2 years, a history of multiple flares, extensive disease. 5-asa withdrawal should also be considered in patients with uc escalated to biologic therapy who have achieved remission and in all patients with cd. although 5-asa therapy may have chemopreventive benefits for crc, the cost-benefit ratio appears significant, and this indication is not justified by evidence in those who have achieved remission and are continuing therapy with other agents, or in those in sustained remission without a history of extensive disease.
conclusions: although the majority of patients with ibd receive 5-asa during their disease course, safe withdrawal appears possible in many, with important implications for both health economics and patient experience. a number of unanswered questions, however, remain.",Chapman TP; Frias Gomes C; Louis E; Colombel JF; Satsangi J,2020,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,52,1,73-84,10.1111/apt.15771,"Chapman, T.

methods: we performed a systematic search of pubmed and embase to identify eligible studies examining the association between histologic activity and relapse in patients with cd or uc in endoscopic remission. studies were pooled together using random effects meta-analysis per the dersimonian and laird inverse variance method. the impact of different histologic scales, cut-offs, and individual features were examined.
findings: our meta-analysis included 28 studies contributing 2,806 patients (2677 uc; 129 cd). in uc, histologically active disease was associated with an overall increased risk of relapse (or, 2.41; 95% ci, 1.91-3.04), with a similar effect noted in the subgroup with endoscopic mayo endoscopic score of 0 vs 0 or 1. more rigorous geboes cut-offs demonstrated numerically stronger impact on relapse rates-geboes <3.1 (or, 2.40; 95% ci, 1.57-3.65), geboes <2.1 (or, 3.91; 95% ci, 2.21-6.91) and geboes 0 (or, 7.40; 95% ci, 2.00-18.27). among individual histologic features, basal plasmacytosis (or, 1.94), neutrophilic infiltrations (or, 2.30), mucin depletion (or, 2.05), and crypt architectural irregularities (or, 2.22) predicted relapse. there was no association between histologic activity and relapse in cd.

objective: our study aimed to overview the literature regarding ibd prevalence and phenotype in first- and second-generation migrants also, we aimed to summarize the migration history and to draw a possible correlation with ibd distribution.
methods: a non-systematic review was performed following electronic (pubmed and web of science) and manual searches on relevant topics.
results: overall, first-generation migrants tend to maintain the ibd risk of the native country. on the following generation, the risk tends to converge to that of the destination country. earlier age at migration modulates ibd risk, suggesting that the degree of exposure to environmental and socio-economic factors can be decisive for disease progression. in general, cd needs more time to reach a disease burden similar to that of the host country, indicating that uc may be more affected by nongenetic factors and genetic-nongenetic interactions.
conclusion: ibd phenotypes and natural history vary in migrants and according to ethnicity; however, the trends are not consensual among cohorts. further studies are warranted to analyze the effect of genetic background and environmental risk factors in different ethnic groups, providing evidence to move towards the identification of at-risk individuals, prevention, and earlier diagnosis of ibd.",Fiorino G; Estevinho MM; Lopes DJM; Chersi F; Allocca M; Souto MT; Danese S; Magro F,2021,Current drug targets,22,15,1706-1715,10.2174/1389450122666210203193817,"Fiorino, G., Estevinho, M.

36029078,Nutraceuticals In The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: How The Panorama Has Changed In The Last Decade?,"background: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), mainly ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), are recurrent idiopathic non-infectious chronic diseases widely diffused worldwide and characterized by moderate to severe mucosal damage.
objective: this study aims to review the literature of the last 10 years to photograph preclinical and clinical data on the use of nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment, combined with the conventional drugs, of ibd.
method: pubmed, medline, embase, web of science, and clinicaltrials.gov were used to search for the most recent publications on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence on ibd and nutraceuticals, which were then assessed based on the originality and scientific rigor of the studies.
results: in the last decade, the interest in new healthy or therapeutic complementary or alternative approaches to conventional drugs in ibd has grown inexorably, as well as the incidence of these pathologies and the knowledge of their etiopathogenesis. in this context, a growing development of new nutraceutical products with a consequent increase in pre-clinical studies has been observed. however, this panorama does not yet translate into adequate clinical studies that can effectively endorse what was observed in pre-clinical studies; many of them are mostly aimed at resolving diseases related to ibd rather than ibd itself.

39060735,Probiotics In The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are chronic, incurable inflammatory condition of the gut. they comprise crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. crohn's disease (cd) may affect any tract of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract and is a transmural inflammatory condition; ulcerative colitis (uc), on the other hand, is limited to the mucosal layer of the rectum and colon. treatment options available for both ibd are notoriously loaded with potentially serious side effects and risks. although the pathogenesis of ibd involves a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, microbial and immunological factors, there is evidence that the interplay between the microbiota and the gi mucosa has a preponderant role. it is therefore no surprise that in recent years, a growing interest for effective and safer alternatives has focused on the potential role of prebiotics and-especially-probiotics.the mechanisms of action underlying the potential benefits of probiotics in ibd have been largely and quite extensively investigated in vitro and in vivo experiments. in terms of clinical evidence, the results of trials in the induction of remission of active cd or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics have been so far largely disappointing, to the point that their use in this disease cannot be at present recommended.on the contrary, for the treatment as well as for maintenance therapy of uc, there is clinical evidence of efficacy for some specific strains or multi-strain preparations.it is evident that this is a rapidly evolving and promising field; more data are very likely to yield a better understanding on what strains and in what doses should be used in different specific clinical settings, as we expect new and exciting developments of precision and even personalized therapy by the fast-growing field of probiogenomics.",Guandalini S,2024,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,1449,,135-142,10.1007/978-3-031-58572-2_8,"Guandalini, S.

methods: we conducted a comprehensive search of studies from 1984 to march 31, 2024, focusing on ius use in assessing treatment efficacy in ibd.
results: a total of 51 studies were included: 31 on crohn's disease (cd), 12 on ulcerative colitis (uc) and 8 on ibd. ileocolonoscopy was used as a reference standard in 53% of studies. ius-defined response was reported in 47% of studies, with the majority (71%) using changes in bowel wall thickness (bwt) and color doppler signals (cds) as key indicators. ius-defined remission was reported in 53% of studies, primarily using normalization of bwt to <3 mm and cds to grades 0 or 1 as criteria. ultrasonographic activity scores were used in 16% of studies, including the bowel ultrasound score (buss) in two cd studies, the international bowel ultrasound segmental activity score (ibus-sas) in one cd study, and the milan ultrasound criteria (muc) in one uc study the remaining four studies used unvalidated scores without clear definitions of response or remission. assessment times varied, most commonly at weeks 8-16, and at 6, 12, and 24 months.

32086718,Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Between Genetics And Microbiota.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease that can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. it includes two main disorders: crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). cd and uc often share a similar clinical presentation; however, they affect distinct parts of the gi tract with a different gut wall inflammatory extent. ultimately, ibd seems to emanate from an uncontrollably continuous inflammatory process arising against the intestinal microbiome in a genetically susceptible individual. it is a multifactorial disease stemming from the impact of both environmental and genetic components on the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, ibd genetics has gained a lot of attention. around 200 loci were identified as imparting an increased risk for ibd. few of them were heavily investigated and determined as highly linked to ibd. these genes, as discussed below, include nod2, atg16l1, irgm, lrrk2, ptpn2, il23r, il10, il10ra, il10rb, cdh1 and hnf4α among others. consequently, the incorporation of a genetic panel covering these key genes would markedly enhance the diagnosis and evaluation of ibd.",Younis N; Zarif R; Mahfouz R,2020,Molecular biology reports,47,4,3053-3063,10.1007/s11033-020-05318-5,"Younis, N., Zarif, R., & Mahfouz, R.

38453206,Prevalence Of Metabolic Syndrome In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"objectives: patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) may experience comorbidities involving metabolic syndrome (mets). however, this association remains controversial. our objective was to estimate the prevalence of mets in patients with ibd and assess whether mets is more strongly associated with ulcerative colitis (uc) or crohn's disease (cd).
design: systematic review and meta-analysis.
data sources: pubmed, cochrane library, web of science, embase and medline were searched from their inception to july 2022.
eligibility criteria: observational studies reporting data regarding the rate of comorbid mets among patients with ibd and published in english.
data extraction and synthesis: the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses and the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed. pooled prevalence, ors and 95% cis were calculated using random-effects models. the newcastle-ottawa scale and the agency for healthcare research and quality checklist were used. heterogeneity, sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed using r (v.4.2.1).
results: 11 eligible studies involving 2501 patients were included. of these studies, four reported mets prevalence separately by ibd phenotype, and only one contained a non-ibd comparison group. overall, the methodological quality of the included studies was moderate. the pooled prevalence of mets in ibd was 19.4% (95% ci 15.1% to 23.8%), with a moderate heterogeneity (i2=51.8%, cochrane q statistic=12.4, p=0.053). stratified analyses demonstrated that the aggregate estimate of comorbid mets was significantly higher in uc than in cd (38.2% vs 13.6%, χ2=4.88, p=0.03). we found a positive association between mets and uc compared with cd (or=2.11, 95% ci 1.19 to 3.74, p=0.01). additionally, four studies identified that higher age was a risk factor associated with the development of mets.
conclusions: mets is not rare in ibd, especially in uc. however, longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify the relationship between ibd and mets.

34178115,Artificial Intelligence In Gastrointestinal Endoscopy For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And New Horizons.,"introduction: since the advent of artificial intelligence (ai) in clinical studies, luminal gastrointestinal endoscopy has made great progress, especially in the detection and characterization of neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions. several studies have recently shown the potential of ai-driven endoscopy for the investigation of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). this systematic review provides an overview of the current position and future potential of ai in ibd endoscopy.
methods: a systematic search was carried out in pubmed and scopus up to 2 december 2020 using the following search terms: artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer-aided, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (uc), crohn's disease (cd). all studies on human digestive endoscopy were included. a qualitative analysis and a narrative description were performed for each selected record according to the joanna briggs institute methodologies and the prisma statement.
results: of 398 identified records, 18 were ultimately included. two-thirds of these (12/18) were published in 2020 and most were cross-sectional studies (15/18). no relevant bias at the study level was reported, although the risk of publication bias across studies cannot be ruled out at this early stage. eleven records dealt with uc, five with cd and two with both. most of the ai systems involved convolutional neural network, random forest and deep neural network architecture. most studies focused on capsule endoscopy readings in cd (n = 5) and on the ai-assisted assessment of mucosal activity in uc (n = 10) for automated endoscopic scoring or real-time prediction of histological disease.
discussion: ai-assisted endoscopy in ibd is a rapidly evolving research field with promising technical results and additional benefits when tested in an experimental clinical scenario. external validation studies being conducted in large and prospective cohorts in real-life clinical scenarios will help confirm the added value of ai in assessing uc mucosal activity and in cd capsule reading.

35403222,Use Of Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonists And Risk Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies.,"what is known and objective: the effect of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (h2ras) use causing inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) has been reported in few isolated observational studies; however, pooled estimation of ibd risk has not been done. the present study was conducted to estimate the risk of ibd [crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc) and microscopic colitis (mc)], among h2ras users.
methods: databases such as medline/pubmed, scopus and cochrane library were searched from inception to january 2021. a bibliographic search of selected articles, random search in google scholar and researchgate were also performed for any additional studies. the observational studies which assessed the incidence or risk of ibd in h2ra users published in the english language were considered. modified downs and black checklist was used for quality assessment. two independent reviewers were involved in study selection, data extraction and quality assessment; any discrepancies were settled through consensus or by consulting a third reviewer.
results: four studies out of 2,658 articles were included for this meta-analysis. the meta-analysis of 4 studies with 8939 participants revealed a significantly higher risk of ibd (or: 2.27; 95% ci: 1.70-3.02; p < 0.0001) in h2ra users compared to non-users. similar significant relationships were observed in the subgroup analysis of adults (p < 0.0001) and paediatrics (p = 0.04). the quality of included studies was observed to be fair to good.

40712382,Tryptophan Metabolism And The Intestinal Microbiota: Implications For Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"tryptophan metabolism exerts a pivotal influence on inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) involving intestinal microbiota. tryptophan (trp) undergoes several metabolic processes that result in the formation of several bioactive compounds, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), kynurenine (kyn), and indole analogs, and these metabolites have significant roles in maintaining intestinal health and modulating immune function. the components and ability of the intestinal microbiota affect the metabolic balance of tryptophan, and dysbiosis may lead to disorders of tryptophan metabolism, which may exacerbate the condition of ibd. in this paper, we went over how the intestinal microbiota and tryptophan metabolism interact and the mechanism of tryptophan metabolism and its products in ibd, explored the regulatory roles of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) signaling pathway, immune cells, and immune factors in this regard, and proposed a strategy for the treatment of ibd based on tryptophan metabolism. we also mentioned that tryptophan metabolites exhibit distinct functions between crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), and vary across different stages of the disease. looking forward to the future, in-depth study of the interaction between tryptophan metabolism and intestinal microbiota can give new ideas to the clinical management of ibd.",Hua X; Chen Y; Ding S; Fang J,2025,Microbiological research,300,,128280,10.1016/j.micres.2025.128280,"Hua, X., Chen, Y., Ding, S., & Fang, J.

36173720,Prevalence Of Aphthous Stomatitis In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease After The Treatment With Monoclonal Antibodies: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: currently, the most frequently employed therapies in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), i.e., crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc) or unclassified ibd (ibd-u) are monoclonal anti-tnfs and anti-integrin therapies, such as vedolizumab (vdz). forty-seven per cent of these patients present extra-intestinal manifestations, the second most prevalent being aphthous stomatitis (as). the present study aims to investigate which of the two therapies is associated with a lower prevalence of as after treatment.
material and methods: an electronic search of the medline (via pubmed), web of science, scopus, lilacs and opengrey databases was carried out. the criteria used were those described by the prisma statement. the search was not temporarily restricted and was updated to january 2022. the quality assessment was analyzed using the jbi prevalence critical appraisal tool.
results: after searching, 7 studies were included that met the established criteria. of these, 6 analysed the prevalence of as in cd patients and 4 in uc. a total of 1,744 patients were analysed (cd=1,477 patients; 84.69%; uc=267; 15.31%). the greatest reduction in as prevalence was observed after anti-tnf therapy. the effect of these therapies on the prevalence of as in patients with ibd-u could not be determined.
conclusions: both biologic therapies achieve a reduction in the prevalence of as in ibd patients (cd and uc). however, the best results were obtained in patients treated with anti-tnfs, possibly because vdz is often used in patients who do not respond adequately to previous treatment with anti-tnfs and because of its intestinal specificity.",Salgado-Peralvo AO; Montero-Alonso M; Kewalramani N; Pérez-Sayáns M; Mateos-Moreno MV; Garcillán-Izquierdo MR,2022,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",27,6,e588-e599,10.4317/medoral.25528,"Salgado-Peralvo, A.

aims: we conducted a mendelian randomization research and meta-analysis to explore the impact of ibd and its subtypes (crohn's disease [cd], ulcerative colitis [uc]) on the risk of ich.
methods: two large genome-wide association analysis studies of international inflammatory bowel disease genetics consortium (iibdgc) and international stroke genetics consortium as exposure (ibd, uc, and cd) and outcome (ich) in the initial stage. ibd, cd, uc gwas data from the finngen consortium were adopted for the replication phase, and ultimately, the results of the initial stage and replication phase data were combined in a meta-analysis to evaluate the causal association between ibd and its subtypes and the risk of ich.
results: in the initial stage, we found that in the ivw (odds ratio [or] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.71-0.96, p = .01), mr-presso (or = 0.85, 95% ci: 0.75-0.97, p = .02) and mr.raps (or = 0.86, 95% ci: 0.76-0.98, p = .02) method showed that uc is associated with the risk of ich. the causal relationship between ibd, cd, and the risk of ich cannot be found by the ivw method. ibd and its subtypes uc, cd, and risk of ich cannot find the presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy. in replication stage, ibd (or = 0.74, 95% ci: 0.59-0.94, p = .0135) related to ich, while the ivw approach did not establish a causal link in uc and cd. the meta-analysis still indicated that uc (or = 0.83, 95% ci: 0.72-0.93, p < .05) would lessen the risk of ich while the causality between ibd, cd, and ich was unable to be established.

methods: we conducted a systematic literature search in the pubmed and embase databases. data were extracted using predefined data fields, and risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomized studies. random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.
results: four studies with acute pancreatitis as outcome met the eligibility criteria. the overall estimated risk ratio revealed an increased risk for acute pancreatitis in patients with ibd of 2.78 (95% confidence interval (ci): 2.40-3.22). the risk ratio was increased for both cd and uc, with estimated risk ratios of 3.62 (95% ci: 2.99-4.38) and 2.24 (95% ci: 1.85-2.71), respectively. no studies meeting the eligibility criteria had chronic pancreatitis as outcome.
conclusions: the risk of acute pancreatitis is increased in patients with ibd and higher for patients with cd. due to the observational design of the studies included in our meta-analysis, the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of pancreatitis are unknown and remain to be investigated. studies of the risk of chronic pancreatitis among patients with ibd are warranted.

39777137,Hepatobiliary And Pancreatic Manifestations In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Umbrella Review Of Meta-Analyses.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), can affect the hepatobiliary system and pancreas, substantially impacting the life quality of patients.
objectives: to evaluate the quality of evidence and comprehensively assess the validity of associations of ibd with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases.
design: we performed an umbrella review of existing meta-analyses in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (prisma) recommendations.
data sources and methods: we systematically searched pubmed, embase, and web of science from inception to april 2024, to identify and appraise meta-analyses examining ibd and risk of hepatobiliary and pancreatic manifestations. methodologic quality was assessed with a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews (amstar 2) and the strength of evidence was graded according to prespecified criteria.
results: a total of 14 meta-analyses of observational studies were included. the strongest-validity evidence suggested the significant associations between ibd and risk of gallstones (odds ratio (or) = 1.72; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.40-2.12) and acute pancreatitis (or = 3.11; 95% ci = 2.93-3.30). highly suggestive evidence indicated a significantly increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer in uc (incidence rate ratio (irr) = 2.05; 95% ci = 1.52-2.76) and cd (irr = 2.31; 95% ci = 1.25-4.28). in addition, highly suggestive evidence indicated that ibd was associated with portal venous system thrombosis. suggestive evidence showed a significantly higher prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and autoimmune pancreatitis in ibd patients than in the general population.
conclusion: the associations between ibd and multiple hepatobiliary and pancreatic disorders showed varying levels of evidence and magnitude of risk. further high-quality primary studies are needed to identify ibd patients who are more at risk and would benefit the most from screening and prevention programs.

methods: search the electronic databases pubmed, embase and cochrane databases from inception to november 30, 2022, to identify relevant studies that assess the risk of pd in patients with ibd. the cohort, cross-sectional, mendelian randomization and case-control studies that reported risk estimates of pd and ibd were included in our analysis. the random-effect model and fixed-effects model were used to calculate the summary relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis).
results: in total, 14 studies (nine cohort studies, two cross-sectional studies, two mendelian randomization studies and one case-control study) involving more than 13.4 million individuals were analyzed in our analysis. our results suggested that the risk of pd in ibd patients is moderately increased, with the pooled rr was 1.17 (95% ci: 1.03-1.33, p = 0.019). omit of any single study from this analysis had little effect on the combined risk estimate. no evidence of publication bias was found. in the subgroup analysis, the combined rr was 1.04 (95% ci: 0.96, 1.12, p = 0.311) for crohn's disease (cd), and 1.18 (95% ci: 1.06, 1.31, p = 0.002) for ulcerative colitis (uc). in addition, a significant association was identified in patients with ibd aged ≥ 60 years (rr = 1.22; 95% ci: 1.06-1.41, p = 0.007), but not in age < 60 years (rr = 1.19; 95% ci: 0.58-2.41, p = 0.639). meanwhile, the meta-analysis results suggested a protective role for ibd medication use against pd development, with the rr was 0.88 (95% ci: 0.74, 1.04, p = 0.126).
conclusion: our results indicated that patients with ibd had a moderately higher risk of pd compared to non-ibd individuals. patients with ibd should be aware of the potential risks for pd, especially who were ≥ 60 years old.",Li HX; Zhang C; Zhang K; Liu YZ; Peng XX; Zong Q,2023,Frontiers in medicine,10,,1137366,10.3389/fmed.2023.1137366,"Li, H.

39571265,Novel Targets For Mucosal Healing In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract, primarily manifesting as ulcerative colitis (uc) or crohn's disease (cd). both inflammation and disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier are key factors in ibd pathogenesis. substantial evidence has revealed a significant association between aberrant immune responses and impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier in ibd pathogenesis. the components of the intestinal epithelium, particularly goblet cells and paneth cells, are crucial to gut homeostasis, as they secrete mucin, antimicrobial peptides (amps), and cytokines. furthermore, impairment of epithelial integrity, which is regulated by tight junctions, is a hallmark of ibd pathology. while common treatments for ibd, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, target various signaling pathways with varying efficacies, therapeutic approaches focused on mucosal and epithelial barrier healing have been largely neglected. moreover, high costs, side effects, and insufficient or inconsistent therapeutic outcomes remain major drawbacks of conventional anti-ibd drugs. recent studies on epithelial barrier regeneration and permeability reduction have introduced promising therapeutic targets, including farnesoid x receptor (fxr), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa)-urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (upar) interaction, fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt), and insulin receptor (insr). notably, the simultaneous targeting of intestinal inflammation and promotion of epithelial barrier healing shows promise for efficient ibd treatment. future research should explore targeted therapies and combination treatments, including natural remedies, microbiota colonization, stem cell approaches, and computer-aided drug design. it is also crucial to focus on accurate prognosis and developing a thorough understanding of ibd development mechanisms.",Mansouri P; Mansouri P; Behmard E; Najafipour S; Kouhpayeh A; Farjadfar A,2025,International immunopharmacology,144,,113544,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.113544,"Mansouri, P., Mansouri, P., Behmard, E., Najafipour, S., Kouhpayeh, A., & Farjadfar, A.

methods: a systematic study was conducted in seven databases (pubmed, scopus, web of science, proquest, embase, cochrane, and sciencedirect) from 1960 to december 30, 2024. articles investigating the relationship between periodontitis and ibd were selected based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. the quality of the selected articles was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa checklist. the prevalence of periodontitis in individuals with and without ibd, as well as in each subgroup (uc and cd), was reported in terms of odds ratio (or). data analysis was conducted using comprehensive meta analysis (cma) software.
results: eleven studies were included in this systematic review. statistical analysis of 10 studies revealed that, compared to the control group (without ibd), ibd patients had a significantly higher likelihood of periodontitis (or: 2.28; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.73-3). within each ibd subgroup, the likelihood of periodontitis was higher compared to the control group. the risk of developing periodontitis in patients diagnosed with uc and cd was found to be (or: 3.14; 95% ci: 2.11-4.66) and (or: 1.99; 95% ci: 1.4-2.83), respectively. however, this discrepancy was not statistically significant (p = 0.09).

40429917,Targeting The Il-23 Receptor Gene: A Promising Approach In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which includes crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. a key component of the inflammatory pathway in ibd is interleukin 23 (il-23), which promotes the differentiation and maintenance of th17 cells. these cells are major contributors to intestinal inflammation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. a dysregulated il-23/th17 axis can lead to excessive gut inflammation. notably, il-23 affects th17 cell responses differently in uc and cd, fostering il-17 production in uc and interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) production in cd. genetic studies have pinpointed specific variants of the il-23 receptor (il23r) gene that confer protection against ibd. the r381q (rs11209026) variant has been linked to a reduced risk of developing both cd and uc. additionally, other variants, such as g149r (rs76418789) and v362i (rs41313262), inhibit il23r function by disrupting intracellular trafficking and protein stability. this disruption results in decreased phosphorylation of downstream signal transducers, such as stat3 and stat4, and reduced il23r expression on the cell surface, ultimately dampening the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. the protective effects of these genetic variants underscore the il-23/il23r pathway as a significant therapeutic target in ibd management. therapies designed to modulate this pathway have the potential to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance anti-inflammatory mechanisms. ongoing research into the il23r gene and its variants continues to provide valuable insights, paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments for ibd patients.",Pastras P; Aggeletopoulou I; Papantoniou K; Triantos C,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,10,,10.3390/ijms26104775,"Pastras, P., Aggeletopoulou, I., Papantoniou, K., & Triantos, C.

38994933,Ca2+-Dependent Processes Of Innate Immunity In Ibd.,"ibd is an uncontrolled inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract, which mainly manifests in two forms: ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). the pathogenesis of ibd appears to be associated with an abnormal response of innate and adaptive immune cells. innate immunity cells, such as macrophages, mast cells, and granulocytes, can produce proinflammatory (e.g., tnf-α) and oxidative stress (ros) mediators promoting intestinal damage, and their abnormal responses can induce an imbalance in adaptive immunity, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines that increase innate immune damage, abate intestinal barrier functions, and aggravate inflammation. considering that ca2+ signalling plays a key role in a plethora of cellular functions, this review has the purpose of deepening the potential ca2+ involvement in ibd pathogenesis.",Palestra F; Memoli G; Ventrici A; Trocchia M; Galdiero M; Varricchi G; Loffredo S,2024,Cells,13,13,,10.3390/cells13131079,"Palestra, F., Memoli, G., Ventrici, A., Trocchia, M., Galdiero, M., Varricchi, G., & Loffredo, S.

37140025,Remote Care Through Telehealth For People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"background: people with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) require intensive follow-up with frequent consultations after diagnosis. ibd telehealth management includes consulting by phone, instant messenger, video, text message, or web-based services. telehealth can be beneficial for people with ibd, but may have its own set of challenges. it is important to systematically review the evidence on the types of remote or telehealth approaches that can be deployed in ibd. this is particularly relevant following the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, which led to increased self- and remote-management.
objectives: to identify the communication technologies used to achieve remote healthcare for people with inflammatory bowel disease and to assess their effectiveness.
search methods: on 13 january 2022, we searched central, embase, medline, three other databases, and three trials registries with no limitations on language, date, document type, or publication status.
selection criteria: all published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (rcts) that evaluated telehealth interventions targeted at people with ibd versus any other type of intervention or no intervention. we did not include studies based on digital patient information resources or education resources, unless they formed part of a wider package including an element of telehealth. we excluded studies where remote monitoring of blood or faecal tests was the only form of monitoring.
data collection and analysis: two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed their risk of bias. we analysed studies on adult and paediatric populations separately. we expressed the effects of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (rrs) and the effects of continuous outcomes as mean differences (mds) or standardised mean differences (smds), each with their 95% confidence intervals (cis). we assessed the certainty of the evidence using grade methodology.
main results: we included 19 rcts with a total of 3489 randomised participants, aged eight to 95 years. three studies examined only people with ulcerative colitis (uc), two studies examined only people with crohn's disease (cd), and the remaining studies examined a mix of ibd patients. studies considered a range of disease activity states. the length of the interventions ranged from six months to two years. the telehealth interventions were web-based and telephone-based. web-based monitoring versus usual care twelve studies compared web-based disease monitoring to usual care. three studies, all in adults, provided data on disease activity. web-based disease monitoring (n = 254) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 174) in reducing disease activity in people with ibd (smd 0.09, 95% ci -0.11 to 0.29). the certainty of the evidence is moderate. five studies on adults provided dichotomous data that we could use for a meta-analysis on flare-ups. web-based disease monitoring (n = 207/496) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 150/372) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with ibd (rr 1.09, 95% ci 0.93 to 1.27). the certainty of the evidence is moderate. one study provided continuous data. web-based disease monitoring (n = 465) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 444) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with cd (md 0.00 events, 95% ci -0.06 to 0.06). the certainty of the evidence is moderate. one study provided dichotomous data on flare-ups in a paediatric population. web-based disease monitoring (n = 28/84) may be equivalent to usual care (n = 29/86) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in children with ibd (rr 0.99, 95% ci 0.65 to 1.51). the certainty of the evidence is low. four studies, all in adults, provided data on quality of life. web-based disease monitoring (n = 594) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 505) for quality of life in adults with ibd (smd 0.08, 95% ci -0.04 to 0.20). the certainty of the evidence is moderate. based on continuous data from one study in adults, we found that web-based disease monitoring probably leads to slightly higher medication adherence compared to usual care (md 0.24 points, 95% ci 0.01 to 0.47). the results are of moderate certainty. based on continuous data from one paediatric study, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (md 0.00, 95% ci -0.63 to 0.63), although the evidence is very uncertain. when we meta-analysed dichotomous data from two studies on adults, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (rr 0.87, 95% ci 0.62 to 1.21), although the evidence is very uncertain. we were unable to draw any conclusions on the effects of web-based disease monitoring compared to usual care on healthcare access, participant engagement, attendance rate, interactions with healthcare professionals, and cost- or time-effectiveness. the certainty of the evidence is very low.
authors' conclusions: the evidence in this review suggests that web-based disease monitoring is probably no different to standard care in adults when considering disease activity, occurrence of flare-ups or relapse, and quality of life. there may be no difference in these outcomes in children, but the evidence is limited. web-based monitoring probably increases medication adherence slightly compared to usual care. we are uncertain about the effects of web-based monitoring versus usual care on our other secondary outcomes, and about the effects of the other telehealth interventions included in our review, because the evidence is limited. further studies comparing web-based disease monitoring to standard care for the clinical outcomes reported in adults are unlikely to change our conclusions, unless they have longer follow-up or investigate under-reported outcomes or populations. studies with a clearer definition of web-based monitoring would enhance applicability, enable practical dissemination and replication, and enable alignment with areas identified as important by stakeholders and people affected by ibd.",Gordon M; Sinopoulou V; Lakunina S; Gjuladin-Hellon T; Bracewell K; Akobeng AK,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,5,5,CD014821,10.1002/14651858.CD014821.pub2,"Gordon, M., Sinopoulou, V., Lakunina, S., Gjuladin-Hellon, T., Bracewell, K., & Akobeng, A.

37059601,[Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Scoring And Pathological Reports Optimization].,"the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). both diseases have inflammatory flare-ups that alternate with periods of remission. the pathologist may examine biopsies of the digestive tract from ibd patients in different contexts: at the time of the initial diagnosis, in the event of a disease flare-up in order to differentiate a flare of the disease from another cause, particularly an infectious one, and during the long term follow-up of the disease in order to detect the occurrence of dysplastic lesions. pathologists are increasingly involved in the evaluation of inflammatory activity during the follow-up of ibd patients. the therapeutic management of ibd has evolved significantly and the emergence of new treatments allows a global approach targeting endoscopic mucosal healing. however, mucosal healing is not always correlated with histological healing. numerous studies have shown the value of histological evaluation during follow-up. a higher score for histological activity in ulcerative colitis predicts a higher likelihood of neoplasia. histological activity is a better predictor than endoscopic inflammation of the risk. in uc, histological remission may be a long-term therapeutic goal but its role in cd remains unclear. different scores have been developed to quantify the inflammatory activity of ibd patients and the response to treatment. the aim of this review is to present the main activity scores used in the follow-up of ibd, their interest, their evaluation and their limitations.",Boulagnon-Rombi C; Marchal A; Lirsac M; Svrcek M,2023,Annales de pathologie,43,3,170-179,10.1016/j.annpat.2023.03.007,"Boulagnon-Rombi, C., Marchal, A., Lirsac, M., & Svrcek, M.

38524131,Long Noncoding Rnas And Circular Rnas As Potential Diagnostic Biomarkers Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"introduction: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) poses a growing global burden, necessitating the discovery of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. the clinical significance of dysregulated expression of long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) and circular rnas (circrnas) in diagnosing ibd has not been well established. thus, our study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of lncrnas and circrnas for ibd based on currently available studies.
methods: a comprehensive search was carried out in diverse electronic databases, such as pubmed, embase, scopus, science direct and wiley online library to retrieve articles published until october 30, 2023. stata 17.0 software was employed to determine pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (plr), negative likelihood ratio (nlr), diagnostic ratio (dor), and area under the curve (auc). heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression were explored, and publication bias was assessed using deeks' funnel plot. fagan's nomogram and likelihood ratio scattergram were employed to evaluate the clinical validity.
result: a total of 11 articles encompassing 21 studies which involved 1239 ibd patients and 985 healthy controls were investigated. the findings revealed lncrnas exhibit high level of pooled sensitivity 0.94 (95% ci: 0.87-0.97) and specificity 0.99 (95% ci: 0.89-1.00), along with plr, nlr, dor, and auc values of 64.25 (95% ci: 7.39-558.66), 0.06 (95% ci: 0.03-0.13), 1055.25 (95% ci: 70.61-15770.77), and 0.99 (95% ci: 0.97-0.99), respectively. conversely, circrnas showed moderate accuracy in ibd diagnosis, with sensitivity of 0.68 (95% ci: 0.61-0.73), specificity of 0.73 (95% ci: 0.65-0.79), plr of 2.47 (95% ci: 1.94-3.16), nlr of 0.45 (95% ci: 0.38-0.53), dor of 5.54 (95% ci: 3.88-7.93), and auc value of 0.75 (95% ci: 0.71-0.79). moreover, findings from subgroup analysis depicted heightened diagnostic efficacy when employing lncrna h19 and a large sample size (≥100), with notable efficacy in diagnosing both ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd).
conclusion: lncrnas exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing patients with ibd from healthy controls signifying their possible use as potential biomarkers, while circrnas showed moderate diagnostic accuracy. nevertheless, to validate our findings and confirm the clinical utility of lncrnas and circrnas in ibd diagnosis, a large pool of prospective and multi-center studies should be undertaken.

summary: two pharmacological principles have been successfully used for ibd treatment: inhibition of cellular signaling and interference with leukocyte trafficking. besides tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (il)-23 is a promising drug target, and antibodies for the combined inhibition of il-23 and il-12 (ustekinumab and briakinumab) or selective il-23 inhibition (brazikumab, risankizumab, and mirikizumab) seem to be effective in crohn's disease (cd) with emerging evidence also for ulcerative colitis (uc). janus kinase (jak) mediates intracellular signaling of a large number of cytokines. tofacitinib is the first jak inhibitor approved for uc, and the jak inhibitors filgotinib and upadacitinib showed potential in cd. leukocyte trafficking can be inhibited by interference with lymphocyte integrin-α4β7 or endothelial madcam-1. the α4β7 integrin inhibitor vedolizumab is an established treatment in ibd, and long-term data of pivotal studies are now available. additional molecules with therapeutic potential are α4β7-specific abrilumab, β7-specific etrolizumab, and the α4-specific small molecule ajm300. pf-00547659, an antibody against endothelial madcam-1, also showed therapeutic potential in uc. modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (s1pr) activity is necessary for the egress of lymphocytes into the circulation, and s1pr modulation results in lymphocyte trapping in lymphatic organs. ozanimod, an s1pr1 and s1pr5 inhibitor, has been successfully tested in initial studies in uc. mesenchymal stem cell therapy has been approved for the treatment of complex, active cd fistula, and mesenchymal stem cell therapy might be a paradigm shift for this condition. autologous stem cell transplantation (asct) has been successfully used in cd case series; however, in a randomized trial, a highly stringent endpoint was not met. however, considering positive effects in secondary endpoints, asct might be a future treatment of last resort in severe, refractory cd cases, provided that safer protocols can be provided. key messages: new ibd treatments are successful for a significant fraction of patients. however, new strategies for patient selection, treatment combinations, and/or additional therapies must be developed to serve the need of all ibd patients.",Misselwitz B; Juillerat P; Sulz MC; Siegmund B; Brand S,2020,Digestion,101 Suppl 1,,69-82,10.1159/000507782,"Misselwitz, B., Juillerat, P., Sulz, M.

35224015,5-Aminosalicylic Acid Chemoprevention In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Is It Necessary In The Age Of Biologics And Small Molecules?,"background: due to the increased incidence of colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds), the value of chemoprevention for this patient group has been repeatedly debated in the past decade. this review describes available evidence and the current recommendations for chemoprevention in national and international guidelines ibd guidelines.
summary: 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) compounds are the preferred therapeutic option for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (uc). aside from the known anti-inflammatory effects, their chemopreventive abilities have been described in vitro and in vivo. pooling the increasing number of retrospective and population-based clinical studies over the last 15 years, 7 consecutive meta-analyses revealed partially conflicting results for the chemopreventive efficacy of 5-asa, and thus, not all ibd guidelines currently recommend chemoprevention with mesalamine compounds. accumulating evidence for decreasing the colorectal cancer (crc) risk in support of thiopurines more recently shows a protective effect. this effect seems solely mediated by control of intestinal inflammation since, for this drug class, another mechanistic interference in ibd-associated crc pathogenesis is not known. the results regarding chemopreventive efficacy for ursodeoxycholic acid or folic acid are equivocal, and the use of these medications to prevent crc is not firmly established. like uc, the risk of crc is also significantly increased in patients with crohn's disease (cd), especially crohn's colitis. however, no published studies exclusively assess the effects of surveillance on the early detection of cancer or crc chemoprevention in cd patients. in meta-analyses, which predominantly included uc patients, 5-asa or thiopurines were not beneficial in small cd subgroups. the level of evidence for anti-tnfα agents, anti-integrin (e.g., vedolizumab), or anti-il-12/il-23 agents (e.g., ustekinumab) and janus kinase inhibitors is currently too low or nonexistent to use them solely for chemoprevention in uc or cd patients.
key message: intestinal inflammation is one of the main risk factors for developing crc in ibd, and all drugs that induce and maintain mucosal healing most likely also decrease the ibd-associated crc risk. thus, a therapeutic strategy of adding a 5-asa therapy to a successfully mucosal healing-inducing therapy, for example, with a biologic or a small molecule merely to prevent crc appears to be obsolete.",Herfarth H; Vavricka SR,2022,Inflammatory intestinal diseases,7,1,28-35,10.1159/000518865,"Herfarth, H., & Vavricka, S.

32419327,Targeting Desmosomal Adhesion And Signalling For Intestinal Barrier Stabilization In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases-Lessons From Experimental Models And Patients.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) such as crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) have a complex and multifactorial pathogenesis which is incompletely understood. a typical feature closely associated with clinical symptoms is impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function. mounting evidence suggests that desmosomes, which together with tight junctions (tj) and adherens junctions (aj) form the intestinal epithelial barrier, play a distinct role in ibd pathogenesis. this is based on the finding that desmoglein (dsg) 2, a cadherin-type adhesion molecule of desmosomes, is required for maintenance of intestinal barrier properties both in vitro and in vivo, presumably via dsg2-mediated regulation of tj. mice deficient for intestinal dsg2 show increased basal permeability and are highly susceptible to experimental colitis. in several cohorts of ibd patients, intestinal protein levels of dsg2 are reduced and desmosome ultrastructure is altered suggesting that dsg2 is involved in ibd pathogenesis. in addition to its adhesive function, dsg2 contributes to enterocyte cohesion and intestinal barrier function. dsg2 is also involved in enterocyte proliferation, barrier differentiation and induction of apoptosis, in part by regulation of p38mapk and egfr signalling. in ibd, the function of dsg2 appears to be compromised via p38mapk activation, which is a critical pathway for regulation of desmosomes and is associated with keratin phosphorylation in ibd patients. in this review, the current findings on the role of dsg2 as a novel promising target to prevent loss of intestinal barrier function in ibd patients are discussed.",Schlegel N; Boerner K; Waschke J,2021,"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",231,1,e13492,10.1111/apha.13492,"Schlegel, N., Boerner, K., & Waschke, J.

38186999,Exosome-Mediated Macrophage Regulation For Inflammatory Bowel Disease Repair: A Potential Target Of Gut Inflammation.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which includes crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), is a complex condition without a definite cause. during ibd, immune cells such as macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, contributing to intestinal barrier integrity dysfunction. ibd is largely influenced by macrophages, which are classified into subtypes m1 and m2. m1 macrophages have been found to contribute to the development of ibd, whereas m2 macrophages alleviate ibd. hence, agents that cause increased polarization of the m2 phenotype could help repair ibd. exosomes, as ubiquitous conveyors of intercellular messages, are involved in immune responses and immune-mediated disease processes. exosomes and their microrna (mirna) from healthy cells have been found to polarize macrophages to m2 to repair ibd due to their anti-inflammatory properties; however, those from inflammatory-driven cells and disease cells promote m1 macrophages to perpetuate ibd. here, we review the biogenesis, biochemical composition, and sources of exosomes, as well as the roles of exosomes as extracellular vesicles in regulation of macrophages to repair ibd.",Ma F; Zhang S; Akanyibah FA; Zhang W; Chen K; Ocansey DKW; Lyu C; Mao F,2023,American journal of translational research,15,12,6970-6987,,"Ma, F., Zhang, S., Akanyibah, F.

33026230,Role And Mechanisms Of Exosomal Mirnas In Ibd Pathophysiology.,"exosomes represent secretory membranous vesicles used for the information exchange between cells and organ-to-organ communication. exosome crosstalk mechanisms are involved in the regulation of several inflammatory bowel disease (ibd)-associated pathophysiological intestinal processes such as barrier function, immune responses, and intestinal flora. functional biomolecules, mainly noncoding rnas (ncrnas), are believed to be transmitted between the mammalian cells via exosomes that likely play important roles in cell-to-cell communication, both locally and systemically. micrornas (mirnas) encapsulated in exosomes have generated substantial interest because of their critical roles in multiple pathophysiological processes. in addition, exosomal mirnas are implicated in the gut health. mirnas are selectively and actively loaded into the exosomes and then transferred to the target recipient cell where they manipulate cell function through posttranscriptional silencing of target genes. intriguingly, mirna profile of exosomes differs from their cellular counterparts suggesting an active sorting and packaging mechanism of exosomal mirnas. even more exciting is the involvement of posttranscriptional modifications in the specific loading of mirnas into exosomes, but the underlying mechanisms of how these modifications direct ncrna sorting have not been established. this review gives a brief overview of the status of exosomes and exosomal mirnas in ibd and also discusses potential mechanisms of exosomal mirna sorting and delivering.",Wani S; Man Law IK; Pothoulakis C,2020,American journal of physiology.

methods: in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched medline, embase, embase classic, and psycinfo for papers published from inception to sept 30, 2020, reporting observational studies that recruited at least 100 adult patients with ibd and that reported prevalence of symptoms of anxiety or depression according to validated screening instruments. we excluded studies that only used a structured interview to assess for these symptoms and studies that did not provide extractable data. we extracted data from published study reports and calculated pooled prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depression, odds ratios (or), and 95% cis.
findings: of 5544 studies identified, 77 fulfilled the eligibility criteria, including 30 118 patients in total. overall, pooled prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 32·1% (95% ci 28·3-36·0) in 58 studies (i2=96·9%) and pooled prevalence of depression symptoms was 25·2% (22·0-28·5) in 75 studies (i2=97·6%). in studies that reported prevalence of anxiety or depression in patients with crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis within the same study population, patients with crohn's disease had higher odds of anxiety symptoms (or 1·2, 95% ci 1·1-1·4) and depression symptoms (1·2, 1·1-1·4) than patients with ulcerative colitis. overall, women with ibd were more likely to have symptoms of anxiety than were men with ibd (pooled prevalence 33·8% [95% ci 26·5-41·5] for women vs 22·8% [18·7-27·2] for men; or 1·7 [95% ci 1·2-2·3]). they were also more likely to have symptoms of depression than men were (pooled prevalence 21·2% [95% ci 15·4-27·6] for women vs 16·2% [12·6-20·3] for men; or 1·3 [95% ci 1·0-1·8]). the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety (57·6% [95% ci 38·6-75·4]) or depression (38·9% [26·2-52·3]) was higher in patients with active ibd than in patients with inactive disease (38·1% [30·9-45·7] for anxiety symptoms and 24·2% [14·7-35·3] for depression symptoms; ors 2·5 [95% ci 1·5-4·1] for anxiety and 3·1 [1·9-4·9] for depression).
interpretation: there is a high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with ibd, with up to a third of patients affected by anxiety symptoms and a quarter affected by depression symptoms. prevalence was also increased in patients with active disease: half of these patients met criteria for anxiety symptoms and a third met criteria for depression symptoms. encouraging gastroenterologists to screen for and treat these disorders might improve outcomes for patients with ibd.

objectives: to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for managing fatigue in ibd compared to no treatment, placebo or active comparator.
search methods: a systematic search of the databases embase, medline, cochrane library, cinahl, psycinfo was undertaken from inception to july 2018. a top-up search was run in october 2019. we also searched the cochrane ibd group specialized register, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, ongoing trials and research registers, conference abstracts and reference lists for potentially eligible studies.
selection criteria: randomised controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in children or adults with ibd, where fatigue was assessed as a primary or secondary outcome using a generic or disease-specific fatigue measure, a subscale of a larger quality of life scale or as a single-item measure, were included.
data collection and analysis: two authors independently screened search results and four authors extracted and assessed bias independently using the cochrane 'risk of bias' tool. the primary outcome was fatigue and the secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events (aes), serious aes and withdrawal due to aes. standard methodological procedures were used.
main results: we included 14 studies (3741 participants): nine trials of pharmacological interventions and five trials of non-pharmacological interventions. thirty ongoing studies were identified, and five studies are awaiting classification. data on fatigue were available from nine trials (1344 participants). in only four trials was managing fatigue the primary intention of the intervention (electroacupuncture, physical activity advice, cognitive behavioural therapy and solution-focused therapy). electroacupuncture fatigue was measured with functional assessment of chronic illness therapy - fatigue (facit-f) (scores range from 0 to 52). the facit-f score at week eight was 8.00 points higher (better) in participants receiving electroacupuncture compared with no treatment (mean difference (md) 8.00, 95% ci 6.45 to 9.55; 1 rct; 27 participants; low-certainty evidence). results at week 16 could not be calculated. facit-f scores were also higher with electroacupuncture compared to sham electroacupuncture at week eight (md 5.10, 95% ci 3.49 to 6.71; 1 rct; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) but not at week 16 (md 2.60, 95% ci 0.74 to 4.46; 1 rct; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence). no adverse events were reported, except for one adverse event in the sham electroacupuncture group. cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) and solution-focused therapy compared with a fatigue information leaflet, the effects of cbt on fatigue are very uncertain (inflammatory bowel disease-fatigue (ibd-f) section i: md -2.16, 95% ci -6.13 to 1.81; ibd-f section ii: md -21.62, 95% ci -45.02 to 1.78; 1 rct, 18 participants, very low-certainty evidence). the efficacy of solution-focused therapy on fatigue is also very uncertain, because standard summary data were not reported (1 rct, 98 participants). physical activity advice one 2 x 2 factorial trial (45 participants) found physical activity advice may reduce fatigue but the evidence is very uncertain. at week 12, compared to a control group receiving no physical activity advice plus omega 3 capsules, facit-f scores were higher (better) in the physical activity advice plus omega 3 group (facit-f md 6.40, 95% ci -1.80 to 14.60, very low-certainty evidence) and the physical activity advice plus placebo group (facit-f md 9.00, 95% ci 1.64 to 16.36, very low-certainty evidence). adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal and similar across physical activity groups, although more adverse events were reported in the no physical activity advice plus omega 3 group. pharmacological interventions compared with placebo, adalimumab 40 mg, administered every other week ('eow') (only for those known to respond to adalimumab induction therapy), may reduce fatigue in patients with moderately-to-severely active crohn's disease, but the evidence is very uncertain (facit-f md 4.30, 95% ci 1.75 to 6.85; very low-certainty evidence). the adalimumab 40 mg eow group was less likely to experience serious adverse events (or 0.56, 95% ci 0.33 to 0.96; 521 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and withdrawal due to adverse events (or 0.48, 95%ci 0.26 to 0.87; 521 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). ferric maltol may result in a slight increase in fatigue, with better sf-36 vitality scores reported in the placebo group compared to the treatment group following 12 weeks of treatment (md -9.31, 95% ci -17.15 to -1.47; 118 participants; low-certainty evidence). there may be little or no difference in adverse events (or 0.55, 95% ci 0.26 to 1.18; 120 participants; low-certainty evidence) authors' conclusions: the effects of interventions for the management of fatigue in ibd are uncertain. no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions can be drawn. further high-quality studies, with a larger number of participants, are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of therapies. future studies should assess interventions specifically designed for fatigue management, targeted at selected ibd populations, and measure fatigue as the primary outcome.",Farrell D; Artom M; Czuber-Dochan W; Jelsness-Jørgensen LP; Norton C; Savage E,2020,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,4,4,CD012005,10.1002/14651858.CD012005.pub2,"Farrell, D., Artom, M., Czuber-Dochan, W., Jelsness-Jørgensen, L.

methods: pubmed, embase, and web of science were searched through november 2021 for studies reporting data on ibd among psc patients. the outcomes were the prevalence of ibd in patients with psc, as well as the association (odds ratio [or]) of ibd in psc according to subtype and sex.
results: based on the analysis of 25 studies, the prevalence of ibd in patients with psc was 71.1% (95% ci 68.2-75.1%), most commonly in uc (55.9%, 95% ci 52.5-59.3%). the pooled prevalence of ibd was 76.9% in australia (95% ci 71.2-82.6%, 1 study), 75.9% (95% ci 69.5-82.3%, 4 studies) in north america, 70.9% (95% ci 65.8-76.0%, 17 studies) in europe and 67.0% (95% ci 57.9-76.0%, 2 studies) in asia. male psc patients had a higher prevalence of ibd (or 1.67, 95% ci 1.52-1.83) and uc (or 2.02, 95% ci 1.56-2.63) and a lower prevalence of cd (or 0.77, 95% ci 0.67-0.88) than female patients. large duct psc patients had a higher prevalence of ibd (or 2.57, 95% ci 2.03-3.25) and uc (or 4.51, 95% ci 1.22-16.71) than small duct psc patients.

methods: we performed a literature review of the involvement of different epigenetic mechanisms in headache, mainly using the medline/pubmed database. to this end, we used the following english search terms: headache, migraine, epigenetics, dna methylation, histones, non-coding rna, and mirna.
results: a total of 15 english-language publications related to the above terms were obtained.

aims: to assess the incidence of pg and identify factors associated with pg in ibd patients.
methods: a search of electronic databases (ovid and pubmed) was conducted between 1966 and 2019. studies that calculated the incidence of pg in ibd patient cohorts were included. patient demographics, ibd subtype, and eim presence were recorded. a review of our institutional database of 1057 ibd patients was conducted. a multivariate regression model and meta-analysis were conducted to identify risk factors for pg. a random effects model was used to combine the data of included studies.
results: fourteen studies were included in addition to 1057 ibd patients and 26 pg cases from the louisville cohort. in total, there were 379 cases of pg in the cumulative cohort of 61,695 ibd patients. the pg incidence in individual studies ranged from 0.4 to 2.6%. in the institutional cohort, ocular eims and a permanent stoma were significant risk factors for pg. in the meta-analysis, pg was associated with female gender (rr = 1.328, 95% ci 1.161-1.520), crohn's disease (rr = 1.193, 95% ci 1.001-1.422), erythema nodosum (rr = 9.281, 95% ci 6.081-14.164), and ocular eim (rr = 4.55, 95% ci 3.04-6.81). there was study heterogeneity when assessing ibd subtype, ocular, and joint eims.

objective: the aim was to evaluate whether isotretinoin use is associated with ibd.
methods: we performed a systematic review and searched medline, embase, and central databases from inception to january 27, 2023 for relevant case-control and cohort studies. our outcome was the pooled odds ratio (or) for ibd and its two subtypes (crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) in relation to isotretinoin exposure. we conducted a random-effects model meta-analysis and a sensitivity analysis by excluding low-quality studies. a subgroup analysis was undertaken by including studies considering antibiotic use. a trial sequential analysis (tsa) was performed to test the robustness of the conclusiveness of our results.
results: we included eight studies (four case-control and four cohort studies) with a total of 2,522,422 participants. the meta-analysis found no increased odds for ibd among patients receiving isotretinoin (or 1.01; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.80-1.27). nor did the meta-analysis find increased odds for either crohn disease (or 0.87; 95% ci 0.65-1.15) or ulcerative colitis (or 1.27; 95% ci 0.94-1.73) associated with isotretinoin exposure. the sensitivity and subgroup analyses produced similar results. in tsa, the z-curve reached the futility boundaries when using relative risk reduction thresholds ranging from 5% to 15%.
conclusion: this meta-analysis with tsa found no evidence of an association of isotretinoin use with ibd. isotretinoin should not be withheld because of unnecessary concerns for the development of ibd.

methods: a comprehensive search was conducted in the pubmed, embase, web of science, and cochrane library databases for relevant articles published up to december 16th, 2023. a random-effects model was employed to pool the weighted mean difference (wmd) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) of platelet count (plt), mean platelet volume (mpv), platelet distribution width (pdw), and plateletcrit (pct) between ibd patients and healthy controls, and subgroup analyses were performed.
results: the meta-analysis included 79 articles with 8,350 ibd patients and 13,181 healthy individuals. the results revealed significantly increased plt and pct levels (wmd: 69.910, 95% ci: 62.177, 77.643 109/l; wmd: 0.046%, 95% ci: 0.031%, 0.061%), and decreased mpv levels (wmd: -0.912, 95% ci: -1.086, -0.739 fl) in ibd patients compared to healthy individuals. no significant difference was found in pdw between the ibd and control groups (wmd: -0.207%, 95% ci: -0.655%, 0.241%). subgroup analysis by disease type and disease activity showed no change in the differences for plt, pct, and mpv in the ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease groups, as well as the active and inactive groups. notably, the active group exhibited significantly lower pdw levels than the control group (wmd: -1.138%, 95% ci: -1.535%, -0.741%).
conclusions: compared with healthy individuals, ibd patients display significantly higher plt and pct and significantly lower mpv. monitoring the clinical manifestations of platelet abnormalities serves as a valuable means to obtain diagnostic and prognostic information. conversely, proactive measures should be taken to prevent the consequences of platelet abnormalities in individuals with ibd.

35122401,Computational Models In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic and relapsing disease with multiple underlying influences and notable heterogeneity among its clinical and response-to-treatment phenotypes. there is no cure for ibd, and none of the currently available therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacies beyond 40%-60%. data collected about its omics, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies have grown exponentially with time making ibd a prime candidate for artificial intelligence (ai) mediated discovery support. ai can be leveraged to further understand or identify ibd features to improve clinical outcomes. various treatment candidates are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, offering further approaches and opportunities for increasing the efficacies of treatments. however, currently, therapeutic plans are largely determined using clinical features due to the lack of specific biomarkers, and it has become necessary to step into precision medicine to predict therapeutic responses to guarantee optimal treatment efficacy. this is accompanied by the application of ai and the development of multiscale hybrid models combining mechanistic approaches and machine learning. these models ultimately lead to the creation of digital twins of given patients delivering on the promise of precision dosing and tailored treatment. interleukin-6 (il-6) is a prominent cytokine in cell-to-cell communication in the inflammatory responses' regulation. dysregulated il-6-induced signaling leads to severe immunological or proliferative pathologies, such as ibd and colon cancer. this mini-review explores multiscale models with the aim of predicting the response to therapy in ibd. modeling il-6 biology and generating digital twins enhance the credibility of their prediction.",Pinton P,2022,Clinical and translational science,15,4,824-830,10.1111/cts.13228,"Pinton, P.

aims: to better understand the risk of synchronous colorectal cancer and metachronous advanced neoplasia (ie high-grade dysplasia or cancer) associated with dysplasia diagnosed in the videoendoscopic era, and to stratify risk according to a lesion's morphology, endoscopic resection status or whether it was incidentally detected on biopsy of macroscopically normal colonic mucosa (ie invisible).
methods: a systematic search of original articles published between 1990 and february 2020 was performed. eligible studies reported on incidence of advanced neoplasia at follow-up colectomy or colonoscopy for ibd-dysplasia patients. quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed.
results: thirty-three studies were eligible for qualitative analysis (five for the meta-analysis). pooled estimated proportions of incidental synchronous cancers found at colectomy performed for a pre-operative diagnosis of visible high-grade dysplasia, invisible high-grade dysplasia, visible low-grade dysplasia and invisible low-grade dysplasia were 13.7% (95% ci 0.0-54.1), 11.4% (95% ci 4.6-20.3), 2.7% (95% ci 0.0-7.1) and 2.4% (95% ci 0.0-8.5) respectively. the lowest incidences of metachronous advanced neoplasia, for dysplasia not managed with immediate colectomy but followed up with surveillance, tended to be reported by the studies where high definition imaging and/or chromoendoscopy was used and endoscopic resection of visible dysplasia was histologically confirmed.
conclusions: the prognosis of ibd-dysplasia diagnosed in the videoendoscopic era appears to have been improved but the quality of evidence remains low. larger, prospective studies are needed to guide management. prospero registration no: crd42019105736.",Kabir M; Fofaria R; Arebi N; Bassett P; Tozer PJ; Hart AL; Thomas-Gibson S; Humphries A; Suzuki N; Saunders B; Warusavitarne J; Faiz O; Wilson A,2020,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,52,1,5-19,10.1111/apt.15778,"Kabir, M., Fofaria, R., Arebi, N., Bassett, P., Tozer, P.

33905214,Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: translational data suggest a potential role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot) in a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for the efficacy and safety of hbot in ibd.
methods: we searched pubmed, embase and central to identify studies reporting the efficacy of hbot in ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease. we pooled the response rates for hbot in ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease separately.
results: a total 18 studies were included in the systematic review and 16 in the analysis. the overall response rate of hbot in ulcerative colitis was 83.24% (95% confidence interval: 61.90-93.82), while the response in crohn's disease was 81.89 (76.72-86.11). the results of randomized trials for hbot as adjuvant therapy in ulcerative colitis were conflicting. the complete healing of fistula in fistulizing crohn's disease was noted 47.64% (22.05-74.54), while partial healing was noted in 34.29% (17.33-56.50%). most of the adverse events were minor.

34219654,Cognitive Impairment In Adult Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: people living with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are exposed to multiple risk factors for cognitive impairment and frequently report cognitive difficulties. however, the presence of cognitive impairment in ibd has not been systematically reviewed.
methods: following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, we performed a systematic multidatabase search for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies comparing adults with ibd versus healthy controls for domain-specific cognitive function or scores on multidomain cognitive screening tools. for any domain reported by 3 or more studies, we conducted random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the standardized mean difference between groups; lower scores reflected poorer performance. between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the i2 statistic and study quality assessed using an ibd-modified newcastle-ottawa scale.
results: of 8302 articles screened, 12 studies (n = 687) were included in the qualitative synthesis and 11 in meta-analyses. all studies were cross-sectional. studies generally excluded people with active ibd and older adults. despite no significant differences on multidomain screening tools such as the mini mental state examination (-0.27 [95% confidence interval -0.68, 0.08], p = 0.14), people with ibd showed significant deficits compared with healthy controls in attention (standardized mean difference -0.36 [-0.60, -0.12], p = 0.003, i2 = 0%), executive function (standardized mean difference -0.45 [-0.77, -0.13, p = 0.005, i2 = 42.5%), and specifically in working memory (standardized mean difference -0.58 [-0.85, -0.30], p < 0.001, i2 = 0%). deficits in learning and recall were nonsignificant (p = 0.089) and other domains insufficient for meta-analysis.

39709139,Incidence Of Hepatobiliary Malignancies In Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background & aims: primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) is a known risk factor for hepatobiliary malignancies. we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to determine the incidence and risk factors for hepatobiliary malignancies in people with psc.
methods: pubmed and embase databases were searched from inception to april 10, 2024, for cohort studies reporting data on the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma (cca), hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), or gallbladder cancer (gbc) in psc. pooled incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were estimated using a random effects model.
results: we identified 51 eligible studies involving 26,482 patients. the total follow-up was 221,258.1 person-years (pys). the pooled incidence rates for overall psc were 9.31 (95% ci, 6.84-12.67; i2 = 74%), 1.73 (95% ci, 1.20-2.51; i2 = 55%), and 1.06 (95% ci, 0.85-1.31; i2 = 0%) per 1000 pys for cca, hcc, and gbc, respectively. in patients with psc with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), rates were 7.16 (95% ci, 4.48-11.44; i2 = 96%), 2.19 (95% ci, 1.48-3.25; i2 = 58%), and 1.52 (95% ci, 1.21-1.90; i2 = 0%) per 1000 pys, respectively. subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of cca was higher in smaller studies (<200 patients), and the incidence of hcc varied significantly by region (p = .03), with oceania having the highest incidence and europe having the lowest. meta-regression determined that psc-ibd was associated with hcc incidence.
conclusion: the incidence of cca in psc is substantial, whereas hcc and gbc are rare. patients with psc-ibd may be at higher risk for hcc. these data should be validated in large, prospective studies, and may guide the development of evidence-based surveillance strategies for hepatobiliary malignancies in psc.",Souza M; Lima LCV; Al-Sharif L; Huang DQ,2025,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,23,10,1695-1709.e13,10.1016/j.cgh.2024.09.037,"Souza, M., Lima, L.

35120159,The Exercise-Induced Inflammatory Response In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: this study investigated selected inflammatory responses to acute and chronic exercise in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
methods: a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on all relevant exercise-based intervention publications with ibd participants. the study included articles that utilised a broad range of acute and chronic exercise interventions, with inflammatory biomarkers measured and symptoms documented, both pre- and post-exercise for those with ibd. the search was limited to studies published in english, the use of human participants, and primary studies, with no restrictions on date of publication or participant's age. articles were retrieved through the electronic databases: pubmed, sportdiscus, and scopus. this study adhered to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (prisma) guidelines.
results: six inflammatory markers were included in the meta-analysis which consisted of five studies. exercise interventions resulted in no significant difference in il-6 (smd = -0.09; 95% ci = -0.49, 0.30; p = 0.64), tnf-α (smd = 0.08; 95% ci = -0.31, 0.48; p = 0.68), crp (smd = -0.04; 95% ci = -0.58, 0.50; p = 0.89), il-17 (smd = 0.15; 95% ci = -0.45, 0.76; p = 0.62), leukocytes (smd = 0.40; 95% ci = -0.53, 1.33; p = 0.40) or lymphocytes (smd = 0.32; 95% ci = -0.33, 0.97; p = 0.33), thus, indicating exercise may have no effect on inflammatory markers in ibd. bowel symptoms improved following regular moderate exercise that incorporated stress management.
conclusion: heterogeneity among the identified literature may have led to exercise interventions being ineffective in reducing inflammation. although the limited number of eligible studies may reduce the reliability of results, it emphasises the need for additional research in this domain. importantly, no adverse symptomatic responses to exercise indicate that exercise is safe for ibd patients.",Baker KA; Miller TD; Marino FE; Hartmann TE,2022,PloS one,17,2,e0262534,10.1371/journal.pone.0262534,"Baker, K.

38065857,Incidence Of Histoplasmosis In Patients Receiving Tnf-Alpha Inhibitors: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: immunobiological drugs such as tnf-α inhibitors are valuable in rescue therapy for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), but they increase the risk of infectious complications. histoplasmosis is a significant concern in patients living in endemic regions, however, few studies have assessed the incidence of histoplasma infection during therapy, and classic estimates may underestimate the risk. this study aimed to produce an updated risk estimate of histoplasmosis in patients on tnf-α blocking therapy.
methods: this is a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that contain parameters for calculating the risk of histoplasmosis in people who use tnf-α inhibitors, to produce a risk estimate.
results: we identified 11 studies with the necessary parameters for inclusion in the meta-analysis, most of which were from north america. the incidence rate of histoplasmosis found was 33.52 cases per 100,000 patients treated with tnf-ɑ inhibitors (95% ci 12.28-91.46). considering only studies evaluating monoclonal antibodies, the calculated incidence was 54.88/100,000 patients treated (95%ci 23.45-128.34). in subgroup analysis, the incidence was much higher in patients with ibd compared to rheumatic diseases. there was significant heterogeneity among the studies.

results: seven studies involving 65,454 patients with dementia were included in the meta-analysis. the overall risk of dementia in ibd patients was significantly higher than that in the general population (risk ratio [rr], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.08-1.68; p = 0.008). the results of subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall results. the risk of alzheimer's disease was higher in ibd patients (rr = 2.79, 95% ci = 1.1, 7.04; p < 0.001).
conclusions: our results revealed that ibd may be a potential risk indicator for dementia.",Zhang MN; Shi YD; Jiang HY,2022,International journal of colorectal disease,37,4,769-775,10.1007/s00384-022-04131-9,"Zhang, M.

36227442,Preclinical Evidence For Quercetin Against Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis And Systematic Review.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic, potentially cancerous disease with limited treatment options. quercetin may be a novel treatment for ibd. however, its efficacy and safety are unknown. our goal was to conduct a systematic evaluation to summarize the preclinical effects of quercetin, which may help guide future studies.
methods: the literature was drawn from three english databases (pubmed, embase, and web of science), and the quality of the included literature was assessed using the syrcle list (10 items). the meta-analysis was performed using stata 15.1 software.
results: a total of 11 animal studies with 199 animals were involved. the current meta-analysis showed that quercetin could reduce histological score (hs), disease activity index (dai), interleukin-1β (il-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), nitric oxide(no), malondialdehyde (mda), myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity and increase colon length (cl), weight change degree (wcd), interleukin-10 (il-10), glutathione (gsh), superoxide dismutase (sod) activity and catalase (cat) activity, which may involve anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, cytoprotective, barrier protection, flora regulation.
conclusions: in conclusion, preclinical evidence suggests that quercetin is an ideal agent for ibd treatment. however, the validity of the findings may be compromised by the low methodological quality and the small number of studies included. there may be some discrepancies between the results of the current analysis and the real situation. more rigorous experimental designs and more comprehensive studies are needed to test the protection of quercetin against ibd.",Hu S; Zhao M; Li W; Wei P; Liu Q; Chen S; Zeng J; Ma X; Tang J,2022,Inflammopharmacology,30,6,2035-2050,10.1007/s10787-022-01079-8,"Hu, S., Zhao, M., Li, W., Wei, P., Liu, Q., Chen, S., Zeng, J., Ma, X., & Tang, J.

32032073,Risk Of Tuberculosis In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease On Infliximab Or Adalimumab Is Dependent On The Local Disease Burden Of Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"objectives: infliximab (ifx) or adalimumab (ada) use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) leads to increased risk of tuberculosis (tb). this meta-analysis evaluated the factors which determine this risk, with special focus on local tb incidence.
methods: all studies until january 31, 2019, which reported the development of tb in patients with ibd on ifx/ada, were included after searching pubmed and embase. data regarding disease type, number of patients on ifx/ada, number of patients who developed tb, mean age at ifx/ada initiation, median duration of development of tb, and latent tb (ltb) were extracted. the details on local tb incidence were obtained from the world health organization database, and the studies were stratified into low (<10/100,000), intermediate (10-40/100,000), and high tb burden countries (>40/100,000). random effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate the overall pooled prevalence and prevalence based on local tb burden.
results: of 130,114 patients (128 studies), 373 developed tb (pooled prevalence: 0.08% [95% confidence interval {ci}: 0.05%-0.10%]). the risk increased with increasing tb burden, pooled prevalence being 0.02% (95% ci: 0.02%-0.03%), 0.21% (95% ci: -0.02% to 0.43%), and 1.59% (95% ci: 1.19%-2.00%) for low, intermediate, and high tb burden countries, respectively. seventy-three percent of patients who developed tb had no evidence of ltb on screening, the proportion being independent of tb burden. there was no effect of disease or treatment type, study type, gender, age at ifx/ada initiation, and follow-up duration on tb prevalence.

32835841,Opioid Use Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background and aims: despite reported adverse effects of opioids in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), the burden of opioid use in this population appears to be high. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prior studies to determine the prevalence of opioid use among patients with ibd as well as risk factors and outcomes associated with opioid use in this population.
methods: we conducted a systematic search of medline, embase, web of science, and the cochrane library through november of 2019. primary outcomes included the prevalence of opioid use and demographic and clinical variables associated with opioid use in patients with ibd. quality was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale. we used random-effect meta-analysis to estimate pooled relative risks (rrs) and 95% cis.
results: of 780 citations identified, 31 were included in our study. the prevalence of opioid use was 21% (95% ci, 13%-30%) in the outpatient setting. likewise, 62% (95% ci, 25%-92%) of patients received opioids while hospitalized for ibd. opioid use was associated with female sex (rr 1.20; 95% ci 1.03-1.40), depression (1.99; 95% ci 1.80-2.19), substance abuse (4.67; 95% ci 2.87-7.60), prior gastrointestinal surgery (2.33; 95% ci 1.66-3.26), biologic use (1.36; 95% ci 1.06-1.74), and steroid use (1.41; 95% ci 1.04-1.91). based on the systematic review, opioid use also appeared to be associated with increased ibd activity, healthcare use, infection, and mortality.
conclusion: in a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that 21% of outpatients with ibd (and 62% of hospitalized patients) are opioid users; use is associated with more severe ibd and increased healthcare use. further studies are required to determine whether opioids are the cause or an effect of these associations. nonetheless, urgent interventions are needed to reduce opioid use, improve disease-related outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.",Niccum B; Moninuola O; Miller K; Khalili H,2021,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,19,5,895-907.e4,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.08.041,"Niccum, B., Moninuola, O., Miller, K., & Khalili, H.

methods: a search of pubmed, psycinfo, cinahl, web of science, and cochrane databases was performed. included studies were written in english, presented original peer-reviewed research, included participants with a mean age of 8-18 years, and reported on at least one quantitative sleep outcome for children with ibd or factors impacting sleep for these children. studies that did not report on a sleep outcome or factors influencing sleep, or only examined fatigue were excluded. study quality was evaluated using validated quality assessment tools. the data from the included studies were extracted and synthesized across sleep health domains.
results: database searches yielded 122 records (total participants = 3,905). after full-text and reference/citation searches, 28 articles were included in the review. methods used to evaluate sleep widely varied across studies and a majority of the studies were cross-sectional. results suggest that children with ibd may not experience more frequent sleep disturbance than healthy children. greater sleep disturbance in pediatric ibd was found to be associated with poorer psychosocial functioning and greater active disease/severe symptoms.
conclusions: the findings from this review highlight the complex associations between sleep disturbances, inflammation, disease severity, and psychosocial functioning in children with ibd. additional research with greater methodological rigor (e.g., use of validated sleep measures, longitudinal design, reporting of effect sizes) is warranted to further elucidate these relationships.

methods: pubmed, cochrane, web of science, and embase were searched for studies published through october 2023 on ibd patients with concurrent ckd or esrd. outcomes included the incidence rates and odds ratios (or) of concurrent ckd and esrd in ibd patients. the quality of included studies was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale, and sequential sensitivity was analyzed. publication bias was evaluated using egger's test.
results: nine studies were included in this meta-analysis. the combined results of eight studies, which included 239,042 ibd patients, showed that the prevalence of ckd in ibd patients was 5% (95% confidence interval [ci]: 1-9%). the combined results of two studies, which included 40,341 ibd patients, showed that the prevalence of esrd in ibd patients was 0.2% (95% ci: -0.08-0.12%). the combined results of six case-control studies reported that the risk of ckd was significantly higher in patients with than without ibd (or 1.36, 95% ci: 1.08-1.70, p = 0.008).
conclusion: although studies have shown an increased risk of ckd in ibd, due to the small number of included studies and high heterogeneity across studies, it is not enough to definitively conclude that ckd is more common in patients with ibd. but patients with ibd should be regularly monitored for ckd.

methods: a systematic search of multiple databases was conducted to identify all original, full-text studies until december 2020 with data regarding the incidence rate (ir) and/or prevalence of psc. outcomes were psc ir, prevalence, features and ibd concurrence. additionally, a meta-analysis of psc ir was performed. the study was registered in prospero (crd42021224550).
results: of the 1003 studies identified, 17 studies spanning three continents were included. psc ir was 0.60 per 100 000 person-years (py) (95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.88 per 100 000 py). in pooled subgroup analysis for studies conducted in europe and north america, psc ir was 0.62 and 0.53 per 100 000 py, respectively. psc prevalence ranged 0-31.7 per 100 000 persons, with notable inter-regional differences. mean age at psc diagnosis was bimodally distributed, with relative peaks at 15 and 35 years. mean concurrence of ibd with psc was 50%, with 76% having ulcerative colitis, 17% crohn's disease and 8% indeterminate/unspecified ibd.
conclusion: while considerable heterogeneity exists in the geoepidemiology of psc, overall, the classical dogmata of male predilection, bimodal distribution of mean age and high psc-ibd concurrence appear to hold true. despite a seemingly stable ir over time, further studies are needed to better understand the geoepidemiology of psc.",Mehta TI; Weissman S; Fung BM; Sotiriadis J; Lindor KD; Tabibian JH,2021,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,41,10,2418-2426,10.1111/liv.15007,"Mehta, T.

37716619,Withdrawal Of Immunomodulators Or Tnf Antagonists In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases In Remission On Combination Therapy: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background & aims: withdrawal of immunomodulators (imms) or tumor necrosis factor (tnf) antagonists in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) in remission on combination therapy is attractive. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of (1) imm, or (2) tnf antagonist withdrawal in patients with ibd in sustained remission on combination therapy.
methods: through a systematic review till march 31, 2023, we identified randomized controlled trials (rcts) that compared the efficacy and safety of imm or tnf antagonist withdrawal vs continued combination therapy, in patients with ibd in sustained corticosteroid-free clinical remission for >6 months on combination therapy. primary outcome was risk of relapse and serious adverse events at 12 months. we conducted meta-analysis to calculate relative risk (rr) and 95% confidence interval (ci) and used grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (grade) to appraise certainty of evidence.
results: we identified 8 rcts with 733 patients (77% with crohn's disease, 91% on infliximab-based combination therapy). on meta-analysis of 5 rcts, there was no difference in the risk of relapse between patients with imm withdrawal (continued tnf antagonist monotherapy) vs continued combination therapy (16.8% vs 14.9%; rr, 1.15; 95% ci, 0.75-1.76) without heterogeneity (low certainty of evidence). tnf antagonist withdrawal (continued imm monotherapy) was associated with 2.4-times higher risk of relapse compared with continuing combination therapy (31.5% vs 11.2%; rr, 2.35; 95% ci, 1.38-4.01), with minimal heterogeneity (low certainty of evidence). there was no difference in the risk of serious adverse events with imm or tnf antagonist withdrawal vs continued combination therapy.

33891004,Systematic Review: Sweet Syndrome Associated With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"background and aims: sweet syndrome [ss] is a dermatological condition associated with both inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] and azathioprine use. we performed a systematic review to better delineate clinical characteristics and outcomes of ss in ibd patients.
methods: peer-reviewed, full-text journal publications from inception to april 2020 in english language and adult subjects with ibd were included. skin biopsy was required as ss gold-standard diagnosis. azathioprine-associated ss required recent azathioprine introduction or recurrence of ss after azathioprine re-challenge.
results: we included 89 publications with 95 patients [mean age of ss diagnosis: 44 years; 59% female; 20 with azathioprine-associated ss and 75 without]. ss was diagnosed prior to ibd in 5.3%, at time of ibd diagnosis in 29.5% and after diagnosis in 64.2%. in total, 91% of patients with ss had known colonic involvement and the majority [76%] had active ibd at diagnosis; 22% had additional extra-intestinal manifestations. successful therapies for ss included corticosteroids [90.5%], anti-tumour necrosis factor [tnf]-α inhibitor therapy [14.8%] and azathioprine [11.6%]. azathioprine-associated ss was distinct, with 85% male patients, mean age of ss diagnosis of 50 years and a lower likelihood to be prescribed corticosteroids for treatment [75% vs 94.7% of non-azathioprine-associated ss, p = 0.008]. all patients with azathioprine-associated ss improved with medication cessation and developed recurrence after re-challenge.
conclusions: ss may precede or occur with ibd diagnosis in almost one-third of cases. azathioprine and ibd-associated ss present and behave distinctly, especially with regard to gender, age at diagnosis and recurrence risk. corticosteroids and tnf-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating ss in ibd.",Sleiman J; Hitawala AA; Cohen B; Falloon K; Simonson M; Click B; Khanna U; Fernandez AP; Rieder F,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,11,1864-1876,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab079,"Sleiman, J., Hitawala, A.

39403049,Review Article: Prevention Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-The Path Forward.,"background: the possibility of preventing inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is becoming more plausible due to advances in understanding preclinical disease and successful prevention trials in other immune-mediated diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. however, before that possibility becomes reality, several efforts need to occur in parallel and in a coordinated way.
aim: to propose some critical steps necessary for advancing the field of ibd prediction and prevention.
methods: we reviewed the current literature to identify the necessary steps toward a preventive strategy for ibd.
results: the first step should determine the most robust predictive biomarkers and validate them across independent cohorts, creating a multidimensional predictive tool. the second step is to gain a better understanding of the preferences of first-degree relatives and people at risk for ibd, informing the implementation of screening and preventive strategies. third, these efforts should contribute to the development of high-risk clinics and establish the necessary networks for disease prevention trials.

aims: to summarise current knowledge about frailty in adults with ibd including the prevalence and associations of frailty and ibd-related adverse outcomes.
methods: we performed an electronic search of medline, embase and embase classic databases using search terms for ibd and frailty from inception to 14 february 2024. all studies involving adults aged ≥ 16 with a confirmed diagnosis of ibd that included a frailty assessment were eligible for inclusion.
results: we included 23 observational studies involving 1,893,448 adults. risk of bias was low for 18 studies and moderate for five. twelve methods of frailty assessment were used, the most common being the hospital frailty risk score. pooled prevalence of frailty in ibd patients was 18% (95% confidence interval (ci) 12.4%-25.6%). meta-analysis of unadjusted events data demonstrated that frailty increased the risk of infection-related admissions following treatment in two studies (relative risk (rr) 1.9; 95% ci 1.2-3.0), post-operative morbidity in three (rr 2.0; 95% ci 1.4-2.7) and mortality in seven (rr 4.3; 95% ci 2.6-7.4).
