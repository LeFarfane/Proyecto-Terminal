32702295,Global Prevalence Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome According To Rome Iii Or Iv Criteria: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common functional bowel disorders, but community prevalence appears to vary widely between different countries. this variation might be due to the fact that previous cross-sectional surveys have neither applied uniform diagnostic criteria nor used identical methodology, rather than being due to true global variability. we aimed to determine the global prevalence of ibs.
methods: we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from all population-based studies using relatively uniform methodology and using only the most recent iterations of the rome criteria (rome iii and iv). we searched medline, embase, and embase classic (from jan 1, 2006, to april 30, 2020) to identify cross-sectional surveys reporting the prevalence of ibs in adults (≥90% of participants aged ≥18 years) according to the rome iii or rome iv criteria. we also hand-searched a selection of conference proceedings for relevant abstracts published between 2006 and 2019. we extracted prevalence data for all studies, according to the criteria used to define the presence of ibs. we did a meta-analysis to estimate pooled prevalence rates, according to study location and certain other characteristics (eg, sex and ibs subtype).
findings: we identified 4143 citations, of which 184 studies appeared relevant. 57 of these studies were eligible, and represented 92 separate adult populations, comprising 423 362 participants. the pooled prevalence of ibs in 53 studies that used the rome iii criteria, from 38 countries and comprising 395 385 participants, was 9·2% (95% ci 7·6-10·8; i2=99·7%). by contrast, pooled ibs prevalence among six studies that used the rome iv criteria, from 34 countries and comprising 82 476 individuals, was 3·8% (95% ci 3·1-4·5; i2=96·6%). ibs with mixed bowel habit (ibs-m) was the most common subtype with the rome iii criteria, reported by 33·8% (95% ci 27·8-40·0; i2=98·1%) of people fulfilling criteria for ibs (ie, 3·7% [2·6-4·9] of all included participants had ibs-m), but ibs with diarrhoea (ibs-d) was the most common subtype with the rome iv criteria (reported by 31·5% [95% ci 23·2-40·5; i2=98·1% 61·6%] of people with ibs, corresponding to 1·4% [0·9-1·9] of all included participants having ibs-d). the prevalence of ibs was higher in women than in men (12·0% [95% ci 9·3-15·0] vs 8·6% [6·3-11·2]; odds ratio 1·46 [95% ci 1·33-1·59]). prevalence varied substantially between individual countries, and this variability persisted even when the same diagnostic criteria were applied and identical methodology was used in studies.
interpretation: even when uniform symptom-based criteria are applied, based on identical methodology, to define the presence of ibs, prevalence varies substantially between countries. prevalence was substantially lower with the rome iv criteria, suggesting that these more restrictive criteria might be less suitable than rome iii for population-based epidemiological surveys.

37541528,Efficacy Of Probiotics In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background & aims: some probiotics may be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), but differences in species and strains used, as well as endpoints reported, have hampered attempts to make specific recommendations as to which should be preferred. we updated our previous meta-analysis examining this issue.
methods: medline, embase, and the cochrane controlled trials register were searched (up to march 2023). randomized controlled trials (rcts) recruiting adults with ibs, comparing probiotics with placebo were eligible. dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk of global symptoms, abdominal pain, or abdominal bloating or distension persisting after therapy, with a 95% confidence interval (ci). continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference with a 95% ci. adverse events data were also pooled.
results: we identified 82 eligible trials, containing 10,332 patients. only 24 rcts were at low risk of bias across all domains. for global symptoms, there was moderate certainty in the evidence for a benefit of escherichia strains, low certainty for lactobacillus strains and lactobacillus plantarum 299v, and very low certainty for combination probiotics, lacclean gold s, duolac 7s, and bacillus strains. for abdominal pain, there was low certainty in the evidence for a benefit of saccharomyces cerevisae i-3856 and bifidobacterium strains, and very low certainty for combination probiotics, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, and bacillus strains. for abdominal bloating or distension there was very low certainty in the evidence for a benefit of combination probiotics and bacillus strains. the relative risk of experiencing any adverse event, in 55 trials, including more than 7000 patients, was not significantly higher with probiotics.
conclusions: some combinations of probiotics or strains may be beneficial in ibs. however, certainty in the evidence for efficacy by grade criteria was low to very low across almost all of our analyses.",Goodoory VC; Khasawneh M; Black CJ; Quigley EMM; Moayyedi P; Ford AC,2023,Gastroenterology,165,5,1206-1218,10.1053/j.gastro.2023.07.018,"Goodoory, V.

35433498,Efficacy Of Probiotics For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common gastrointestinal condition. studies regarding the treatment of ibs with probiotics have not yielded consistent results, and the best probiotics has not yet been confirmed. therefore, we performed a network meta-analysis (nma) to assess the relative rank order of different probiotics for ibs.
method: we searched for rcts on the efficacy of probiotics for ibs until august 25, 2021. the primary outcome was the symptom relief rate, as well as global symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, and straining scores. the nma was conducted using stata 15.0. we also used meta-regression to explore whether the treatment length and dose influenced the efficacy.
results: forty-three rcts, with 5,531 ibs patients, were included in this analysis. firstly, we compared the efficacy of different probiotic species. b.coagulans exhibited the highest probability to be the optimal probiotic specie in improving ibs symptom relief rate, as well as global symptom, abdominal pain, bloating, and straining scores. in regard to the secondary outcomes, l.plantarum ranked first in ameliorating the qol of ibs patients, but without any significant differences compared with other probiotic species in standardized mean differences (smd) estimates. moreover, patients received l.acidophilus had lowest incidence of adverse events. the meta-regression revealed that no significant differences were found between participants using different doses of probiotics in all outcomes, while the treatment length, as a confounder, can significantly influence the efficacy of probiotics in ameliorating abdominal pain (coef = -2.30; p = 0.035) and straining (coef = -3.15; p = 0.020) in ibs patients. thus, we performed the subgroup analysis on treatment length subsequently in these two outcomes, which showed that efficacy of b.coagulans using 8 weeks ranked first both in improving the abdominal pain and straining scores. additionally, b. coagulans still had significant efficacy compared to different types of probiotic combinations in present study.
conclusions: the findings of this nma suggested that b.coagulans had prominent efficacy in treating ibs patients, and incorporating b.coagulans into a probiotic combination, or genetically engineering it to amplify its biological function may be a future research target to treat ibs patients. with few direct comparisons available between individual therapies today, this nma may have utility in forming treatment guideline for ibs with probiotics.",Zhang T; Zhang C; Zhang J; Sun F; Duan L,2022,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,12,,859967,10.3389/fcimb.2022.859967,"Zhang, T., Zhang, C., Zhang, J., Sun, F., & Duan, L.

32949284,Endometriosis And Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"purpose: irritable bowel disease and endometriosis are two common diseases characterized by chronic inflammation state and recurrent abdominal pain. as a consequence of sharing of symptoms and chronic inflammation, endometriosis and ibs may coexist and be misdiagnosed and this leads to delays in diagnosis, mismanagement, and unnecessary testing. in recent years, some studies have found higher risk of ibs in women with endometriosis, compared to women without endometriosis. to provide a general overview, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis on published data on this issue.
methods: by a systematic literature search selection process, 11 studies were identified for the current study: 2 prospective and 2 retrospective cohort studies, 4 case-control studies, 1 cross-sectional study and 2 clinical series.
results: when we meta-analysed data about the prevalence of ibs in women with endometriosis, the overall or (95%ci), compared to women without endometriosis was 3.26 (1.97-5.39) with no statistically significant heterogeneity. all three studies considering the incidence of ibs in women with a previous diagnosis of endometriosis showed about twofold greater risk among women with endometriosis than women without. likewise, in the random effects model of the meta-analysis, the overall or of history of ibs in women with endometriosis was 3.10 (95% ci 2.06-4.67), with no heterogeneity between three studies considered.
conclusion: this meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a link between endometriosis and ibs, highlighting two or more times higher risk of ibs in women with endometriosis compared to women without the condition.",Chiaffarino F; Cipriani S; Ricci E; Mauri PA; Esposito G; Barretta M; Vercellini P; Parazzini F,2021,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,303,1,17-25,10.1007/s00404-020-05797-8,"Chiaffarino, F., Cipriani, S., Ricci, E., Mauri, P.

methods: we searched the medical literature up to september 14, 2022, to identify randomized controlled trials (rcts) of mesalamine in ibs. we judged efficacy and safety using dichotomous assessments of effect on global ibs symptoms, abdominal pain, bowel habit or stool frequency, and occurrence of any adverse event. we pooled data using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis).
results: we identified 8 eligible rcts (820 patients). mesalamine was more efficacious than placebo for global ibs symptoms (rr of global symptoms not improving, 0.86; 95% ci, 0.79-0.95; number needed to treat = 10; 95% ci, 6-27), but not for abdominal pain or bowel habit or stool frequency. subgroup analyses demonstrated efficacy of mesalamine in ibs with diarrhea for global ibs symptoms (rr, 0.88; 95% ci, 0.79-0.99), but not patients with other predominant bowel habits or those with post-infection ibs. adverse event rates were no higher with mesalamine (rr, 1.20; 95% ci, 0.89-1.63) but were reported in only 5 trials.

37346153,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation For The Treatment Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder in developed countries and reduces patients' quality of life, hinders their ability to work, and increases health care costs. a growing number of trials have demonstrated an aberrant gut microbiota composition in ibs, also known as 'gut dysbiosis'. fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) has been suggested as a treatment for ibs.
aim: to assess the efficacy and safety of fmt for the treatment of ibs.
methods: we searched cochrane central, medline, embase and web of science up to 24 october 2022 for randomised controlled trials (rcts) investigating the effectiveness of fmt compared to placebo (including autologous fmt) in treating ibs. the primary outcome was the number of patients with improvements of symptoms measured using a validated, global ibs symptoms score. secondary outcomes were changes in quality-of-life scores, non-serious and serious adverse events. risk ratios (rr) and corresponding 95%ci were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, as were the mean differences (md) and 95%ci for continuous outcomes. the cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the trials. grade criteria were used to assess the overall quality of the evidence.
results: eight rcts (484 participants) were included in the review. fmt resulted in no significant benefit in ibs symptoms three months after treatment compared to placebo (rr 1.19, 95%ci: 0.68-2.10). adverse events were reported in 97 participants in the fmt group and in 45 participants in the placebo group (rr 1.17, 95%ci: 0.63-2.15). one serious adverse event occurred in the fmt group and two in the placebo group (rr 0.42, 95%ci: 0.07-2.60). endoscopic fmt delivery resulted in a significant improvement in symptoms, while capsules did not. fmt did not improve the quality of life of ibs patients but, instead, appeared to reduce it, albeit non significantly (md -6.30, 95%ci: -13.39-0.79). the overall quality of the evidence was low due to moderate-high inconsistency, the small number of patients in the studies, and imprecision.

32004880,A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of The Associations Between Endometriosis And Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) are common conditions among young women of reproductive age. the etiologies to the diseases are uncertain, but multifactorial pathophysiology has been proposed for each of them. many studies have examined the two conditions separately, but the literature on the associations between endometriosis and ibs is sparse. however, there is an increasing amount of research on how endometriosis patients are likely to also have a diagnosis of ibs. furthermore, endometriosis shares several features with ibs, such as low-grade inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. this systematic review summarized published original articles in english that have compared associations between endometriosis and ibs. the inclusion criteria for articles in the review were: i) endometriosis was diagnosed by surgical methods, ii) gastrointestinal symptoms were examined in a structured manner and iii) ibs was diagnosed by rome criteria. from the initial 254 publications identified on pubmed, web of science and embase, 13 fulfilled the criteria and could finally be included in the summary. the findings from the review showed that women diagnosed with endometriosis seem to have a twofold or threefold risk to also fulfill the criteria for ibs. the summary risk estimate of the four studies included in the meta-analysis was 2.39 (95 % confidence interval: 1.83-3.11). in women initially diagnosed with ibs, some studies reported a threefold risk of having an endometriosis diagnosis. despite the strong associations reported between the two conditions, this review also revealed a gap in adjusting for factors that may have affected the expression of gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., phases of the menstrual cycle, medication and psychological aspects, which may have interpretation of the reviewed articles' results. the conclusion of this review is that there is a coexistence of gastrointestinal symptoms fulfilling the rome criteria in patients with endometriosis, but it is uncertain whether there is a true comorbidity between endometriosis and ibs, or whether the gastrointestinal symptomatology in endometriosis depends on medication. additionally, the adequacy of the rome criteria to differentiate ibs from the shared symptomatology of other diseases with visceral hypersensitivity must be further evaluated.",Saidi K; Sharma S; Ohlsson B,2020,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",246,,99-105,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.01.031,"Saidi, K., Sharma, S., & Ohlsson, B.

methods: we systematically searched pubmed and google scholar and performed a meta-analysis of 13 studies to analyze how variables such as sample type (stool, biopsy, and lavage) affect results in inflammatory bowel disease gut microbiome studies, using uniform bioinformatic methods for all primary data.
results: reduced alpha diversity was a consistent feature of both cd and ulcerative colitis but was more pronounced in cd. disease contributed significantly variation in beta diversity in most studies, but effect size varied, and the effect of sample type was greater than the effect of disease. fusobacterium was the genus most consistently associated with cd, but disease-associated genera were mostly inconsistent between studies. stool studies had lower heterogeneity than biopsy studies, especially for cd.
conclusions: our results indicate that sample type variation is an important contributor to study variability that should be carefully considered during study design, and stool is likely superior to biopsy for cd studies due to its lower heterogeneity.",Abdel-Rahman LIH; Morgan XC,2023,Inflammatory bowel diseases,29,1,125-139,10.1093/ibd/izac194,"Abdel-Rahman, L.

35581170,Association Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Micronutrients: A Systematic Review.,"background and aim: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a highly prevalent disorder of gut brain interaction with a multifactorial etiology. food trigger avoidance is common among individuals with ibs and exclusion diets are gaining popularity. however, recent guidelines on ibs management cautioned regarding the use of unsupervised dietary therapy with concerns of development of poor eating habits and even nutritional deficiencies. we aimed to review the available literature on the effect of habitual and exclusion diets on micronutrient status as well as the role of micronutrient supplementation in alleviating ibs symptoms.
methods: four electronic databases (pubmed, embase, cochrane, web of science) were searched for articles that reported micronutrient data in patients with ibs. serum micronutrient levels and dietary intake of micronutrients in patients with ibs were collected. the extracted data were tabulated and organized by micronutrient type to observe for trends.
results: twenty-six articles were included in this systematic review (12 interventional and 14 observational studies). studies showed that generally ibs subjects had lower levels of vitamin b2, vitamin d, calcium, and iron at baseline compared with non-ibs subjects. studies also found that exclusion diets were associated with lower intake of micronutrients especially vitamin b1, b2, calcium, iron, and zinc. there was a lack of interventional studies on micronutrients.
conclusion: irritable bowel syndrome patients are at risk of developing multiple micronutrient deficiencies that may have both localized gastrointestinal as well as systemic effects. dietary management of ibs patients should include a proper dietitian review to ensure nutritional adequacy where possible.",Bek S; Teo YN; Tan XH; Fan KHR; Siah KTH,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,8,1485-1497,10.1111/jgh.15891,"Bek, S., Teo, Y.

38102564,Subtyping Irritable Bowel Syndrome Using Cluster Analysis: A Systematic Review.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms. some researchers have used cluster analysis (ca), a group of non-supervised learning methods that identifies homogenous clusters within different entities based on their similarity.
objective and methods: this literature review aims to identify published articles that apply ca to ibs patients. we searched relevant keywords in pubmed, embase, web of science, and scopus. we reviewed studies in terms of the selected variables, participants' characteristics, data collection, methodology, number of clusters, clusters' profiles, and results.
results: among the 14 articles focused on the heterogeneity of ibs, eight of them utilized k-means cluster analysis (k-means ca), four employed hierarchical cluster analysis, and only two studies utilized latent class analysis. seven studies focused on clinical symptoms, while four articles examined anocolorectal functions. two studies were centered around immunological findings, and only one study explored microbial composition. the number of clusters obtained ranged from two to seven, showing variation across the studies. males exhibited lower symptom severity and fewer psychological findings. the association between symptom severity and rectal perception suggests that altered rectal perception serves as a biological indicator of ibs. ultra-slow waves observed in ibs patients are linked to increased activity of the anal sphincter, higher anal pressure, dystonia, and dyschezia.
conclusion: ibs has different subgroups based on different factors. most ibs patients have low clinical severity, good qol, high rectal sensitivity, delayed left colon transit time, increased systemic cytokines, and changes in microbial composition, including increased firmicutes-associated taxa and depleted bacteroidetes-related taxa. however, the number of clusters is inconsistent across studies due to the methodological heterogeneity. ca, a valuable non-supervised learning method, is sensitive to hyperparameters like the number of clusters and random initialization of cluster centers. the random nature of these parameters leads to diverse outcomes even with the same algorithm. this has implications for future research and practical applications, necessitating further studies to improve our understanding of ibs and develop personalized treatments.",Zarei D; Saghazadeh A; Rezaei N,2023,BMC bioinformatics,24,1,478,10.1186/s12859-023-05567-8,"Zarei, D., Saghazadeh, A., & Rezaei, N.

recent findings: clinical features, patient demographics and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with ibs-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of ibs. the advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. in the older, female diarrhea sufferer microscopic colitis should be considered. the role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant ibs is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in ibs remain uncertain.
summary: attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with ibs-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation. wherever indicated, widely available serological and fecal tests will serve to bolster the diagnosis by excluding other options. proceeding to more invasive testing should be dictated by clinical presentation and scenario with the threshold for intervention being generally lower among those with prominent diarrhea.",Quigley EMM,2021,Current opinion in gastroenterology,37,1,39-43,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000686,"Quigley, E.

33227554,Adults Living With Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Ibs): A Qualitative Systematic Review.,"objective: to consolidate existing qualitative studies which examined the experiences and needs of adults living with ibs, and to gather a holistic insight for future directions and avenues to support these adults.
methods: a qualitative systematic review was conducted and six databases were searched for qualitative studies, beginning from each database's inception to july 2020. the qualitative data were meta-synthesised and thematic analysis was adopted. any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached throughout the process of data screening, selection, critical appraisal and synthesis.
results: seventeen studies with a total of 299 adults diagnosed with ibs were included. four themes were identified: (1) physical, psychological, and social consequences; (2) impact of ibs on working adults; (3) dealing with ibs; and (4) sources of support and support needs.
conclusion: future research across geographically diverse locations are needed to gather a thorough perspective of the experiences and needs of adults living with ibs. the development and evaluation of technology-based, trained peer-led volunteers, and interventions that adopt mindfulness, active coping strategies, cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance, and commitment therapy are needed. ultimately, the collaboration between the relevant stakeholders is essential for standardised instruments and materials for accurate testing, diagnosis, assessment, treatment and management of ibs.",Shorey S; Demutska A; Chan V; Siah KTH,2021,Journal of psychosomatic research,140,,110289,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110289,"Shorey, S., Demutska, A., Chan, V., & Siah, K.

32008157,The Association Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Osteoporosis: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: recent studies have suggested that irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) could be a risk factor for osteoporosis although the evidence is still limited. the current study aimed to comprehensively examine the risk of osteoporosis among patients with ibs using systematic review and meta-analysis technique.
methodology: literature search was independently conducted by two investigators using medline, embase, and google scholar database up to october 2019. eligible study must evaluate whether patients with ibs have a higher risk of osteoporosis and/or osteoporotic fracture. it could be either cross-sectional study, case-control study, or cohort study. point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of dersimonian and laird.
results: of the 320 articles identified from the three databases, four cohort and one cross-sectional study with 526,633 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. all five studies investigated the risk of osteoporosis among patients with ibs, and the pooled analysis found that patients with ibs had a significantly higher risk of osteoporosis than individuals without ibs with the pooled risk ratio of 1.95 (95% ci, 1.04-3.64; i2 100%). sensitivity analysis including only cohort studies found a lower rr (pooled rr 1.55; 95% ci, 1.39-1.72) with a lower i2 (59%). three studies investigated the risk of osteoporotic fracture, and the pooled analysis found that patients with ibs also had a higher risk of osteoporotic fracture than individuals without ibs with the pooled risk ratio of 1.58 although statistical significance was not reached (95% ci, 0.95-2.62; i2 99%). sensitivity analysis including only cohort studies found a lower rr (pooled rr 1.27; 95% ci, 1.20-1.39) with a dramatically lower i2 (0%). limitations included high heterogeneity and reliance on diagnostic codes.
conclusion: a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis among ibs patients was observed in this study. early intervention to prevent the development of osteoporosis, such as weight-bearing exercise, adequate intake of vitamin d and calcium, and early screening for osteoporosis, may be beneficial to these patients although further studies are still required to confirm the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach.",Wongtrakul W; Charoenngam N; Ungprasert P,2020,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,31,6,1049-1057,10.1007/s00198-020-05318-y,"Wongtrakul, W., Charoenngam, N., & Ungprasert, P.

39285826,A Systematic Review Of Yoga For The Treatment Of Gastrointestinal Disorders.,"background: several studies have reviewed yoga for the treatment of disorders of gut-brain interaction (dgbi) with most demonstrating a benefit for symptom reduction; however, yoga has been studied beyond dgbi.
purpose: the aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive summary of yoga as treatment for gastrointestinal conditions.
method: we conducted literature searches in pubmed and embase and included yoga trials of adults with a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorders and diseases.
results: we identified 1275 articles; 12 studies were eligible. most studies compared yoga to controls, for patients with different gi conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, chronic pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal cancer). the type, method, and duration of yoga used varied. across ibs studies, most demonstrated that yoga improved ibs symptom severity, mood-related symptoms, and quality of life compared with controls. in one study of inflammatory bowel disease, yoga improved quality of life compared to controls. two studies of gastrointestinal cancer demonstrated that yoga led to a reduction in sleep disturbance and mood symptoms. one study of chronic pancreatitis found that yoga led to improvements in quality of life, stress, mood changes, alcohol dependence, and appetite. yoga was generally safe, and no serious adverse events were attributed to the intervention.
conclusion: in conclusion, yoga appears to be safe and has potential to improve functioning across a spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases; however, current studies are limited by heterogeneity and methodological weaknesses. further research is needed to evaluate the impact of yoga on health outcomes for a broader range of gastrointestinal conditions.",Thakur ER; Shapiro JM; Wellington J; Sohl SJ; Danhauer SC; Moshiree B; Ford AC; Koch K,2024,Neurogastroenterology and motility,,,e14915,10.1111/nmo.14915,"Thakur, E.

34942583,Emotional Stress Responsivity Of Patients With Ibs - A Systematic Review.,"objective: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a highly prevalent disorder of the gut-brain interaction characterized by abdominal discomfort and pain associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of structural abnormalities. chronic psychological stress is considered a risk factor for the development of ibs. the multifactorial pathogenesis involves complex interactions between biological, psychological and social factors, yet the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood.
methods: we systematically reviewed the literature from the databases medline, embase and psycinfo to assess stress responsivity of patients with ibs in comparison to healthy individuals, specifically focusing acute psychological stressors.
results: a total of 37 case-control studies were included in the narrative synthesis. findings comprised subjective changes in emotion (k = 18) and of gastrointestinal symptoms (k = 8) as well as objective parameters of gastrointestinal motility (k = 10), autonomic nervous system (k = 23), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (k = 11), functional brain activity (k = 7) and immune system (k = 3). mental stress was found to increase ibs-specific symptomatology and alter gastrointestinal motility. some patients with ibs showed stress-induced emotional hyperresponsivity and different patterns of neural activation. autonomic and endocrine stress responses depend on the type of stressor and showed no clear evidence of differential reactivity, partly due to confounding factors. data on acute immunological changes remains sparse and requires further investigation.
conclusions: current evidence suggests altered stress reactivity in patients with ibs however, it remains unclear whether it can be attributed to the syndrome itself or the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities.",Schaper SJ; Stengel A,2022,Journal of psychosomatic research,153,,110694,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110694,"Schaper, S.

results: a total of 8 trials (5 ibs-diarrhea and 3 ibs-constipation) with 545 participants using 8 different manipulations were included. all trials were published in chinese. for overall symptom improving rate (> 30 % improvement in overall symptom scores), it had not been shown that tuina was significantly better than rts (rr 1.23, 95 % ci 0.94-1.60, 197 participants, 3 studies, i2 = 65 %) for ibs-diarrhea, and tuina combined with rts showed more benefit than rts alone (rr 1.29, 95 % ci 1.08-1.54, 115 participants, 3 studies) for ibs-diarrhea. all trials did not report adverse effect in relation to tuina. risk of bias was generally unclear across all domains.
conclusions: tuina combined with rts may be superior to rts for improving overall symptom of ibs-diarrhea. due to the existing methodological issues and the heterogeneity of tuina manipulation, current findings need to be confirmed in large scale, multicenter, and robust randomized trials (especially on outcome assessing blinding and allocation concealment).",Bu FL; Han M; Lu CL; Liu XH; Wang WG; Lai JL; Qiu XH; He BX; Zhang H; Robinson N; Fei YT; Liu JP,2020,Complementary therapies in medicine,52,,102504,10.1016/j.ctim.2020.102504,"Bu, F.

37275867,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"objective: whether fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is effective in improving outcomes remains controversial. we assessed the safety and efficacy of fmt for patients with ibs.
methods: in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched pubmed, embase, web of science, the cochrane library, the clinicaltrials.gov and international clinical trials registry platform (ictrp) up to february 25, 2022, updated to march 28, 2023. randomized controlled trials (rcts) compared the stool and capsule fmt with placebo in patients with ibs were included. two authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. we did meta-analysis with revman, and the stata software was used for sensitivity analysis and meta-regression. the grade system was used to assess the quality of evidences. mean difference (md) or standardized mean difference (smd) with 95% ci for continuous data, and risk ratios (rr) with 95% ci for dichotomous data were used with random-effects models. the primary outcomes included the clinical response rate and ibs-sss score. this study is registered with prospero: crd42022328377.
results: nineteen reports from nine rcts were included finally. compared with the placebo, a single stool fmt could significantly decrease the ibs-sss score at 1 month (md=-65.75, 95%ci [-129.37, -2.13]), 3 months (md=-102.11, 95% ci [-141.98, -62.24]), 6 months (md=-84.38, 95%ci [-158.79, -9.97]), 24 months (md=-110.41, 95%ci [-145.37, -75.46]), and 36 months (md=-104.71, 95%ci [-137.78, -71.64]). it also could improve the clinical response rate at 3 months (rr=1.91, 95% [1.12, 3.25]), 24 months (rr=2.97, 95% [1.94, 4.54]), and 36 months (rr=2.48, 95% [1.65, 3.72]), and increase the ibs-qol score at 3 months, 24 months, and 36 months. fmt did not increase the serious adverse event. the risk of bias was low, and the quality of evidence based on grade system was moderate in the stool fmt group. however, we did not find positive effect of capsule fmt on patients with ibs based on the current available data.
conclusion: a single stool fmt is effective and safe for patients with ibs. however, some factors may affect the effectiveness of fmt, and the relationship between the gut microbiome and the effect of fmt for ibs is still unclear.

39779201,Efficacy Of Amitriptyline In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background/aims: amitriptyline is prescribed off-label for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). we conducted a meta-analysis to assess its efficacy.
methods: a systematic literature review was conducted until november 10, 2023, using medline, embase, cochrane library, and web of science to study the efficacy of amitriptyline in patients with ibs. we included all randomized controlled trials that compared amitriptyline to placebo. revised cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of studies. meta-analyses were performed using a bivariate random-effects model. statistical analyses were performed using r software 4.2.3 and heterogeneity was assessed with i2 statistics.
results: seven trials were included with 796 patients (61% female). amitriptyline was associated with better treatment response (or, 5.30; 95% ci, 2.47 to 11.39; p < 0.001), reduced irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scores (md, -50.72; 95% ci, -94.23 to -7.20; p = 0.020) and improved diarrhea (or, 10.55; 95% ci, 2.90 to 38.41; p < 0.001). no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the adverse effects was observed. three trials showed an overall low risk of bias, 2 trials showed an overall high risk of bias due to randomization and missing data, and 2 trials had some concerns regarding missing data.
conclusions: amitriptyline was found to be well-tolerated and effective in treating ibs compared to placebo. these findings support the use of amitriptyline for the management of ibs, particularly among patients with the ibs diarrhea subtype. future research should focus on the dose-dependent effects of amitriptyline in ibs to better guide clinicians in personalized titration regimens.",Iqbal M; Hira S; Saeed H; Shahid S; Butt ST; Rashid K; Ahmad M; Hussain H; Mughal A; Costa GPA; Gushken F; Nero N; Sengupta S; Anand A,2025,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,31,1,28-37,10.5056/jnm24084,"Iqbal, M., Hira, S., Saeed, H., Shahid, S., Butt, S.

40258375,Efficacy Of Gut-Brain Neuromodulators In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Updated Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: gut-brain neuromodulators might be efficacious for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), but there has been no synthesis of evidence from randomised controlled trials (rcts) of some drug classes, and whether they have pain-modifying properties in ibs is unclear. we updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of rcts examining these questions.
methods: we searched medline (from jan 1, 1946, to jan 1, 2025), embase and embase classic (from jan 1, 1947, to jan 1, 2025), and the cochrane central register of controlled trials (from database inception to jan 1, 2025). trials recruiting adults with ibs and that compared gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo over at least 4 weeks of treatment were eligible. dichotomous symptom data were pooled using a random effects model to obtain a relative risk (rr) of remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95% ci.
findings: the search strategy identified 3625 citations. 28 rcts were eligible containing 2475 patients. ten rcts were identified since our previous meta-analysis, containing 1348 patients. the rr of global ibs symptoms not improving with gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo in 22 rcts (2222 patients) was 0·77 (95% ci 0·69-0·87). the best evidence in terms of persistence of global ibs symptoms was for tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) in 11 trials (1144 patients; rr 0·70, 0·62-0·80). the rr of abdominal pain not improving with gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo in 19 rcts (1792 patients) was 0·72 (95% ci 0·62-0·83). the best evidence was for tcas in seven trials (708 patients; rr 0·69, 0·54-0·87), but there was also a benefit of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in seven rcts (324 patients; rr 0·74, 0·56-0·99), and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in two trials (94 patients; rr 0·22, 0·08-0·59). adverse events were not significantly more common with gut-brain neuromodulators, although rates of withdrawal due to adverse events were significantly higher. the certainty in the evidence for tricyclic antidepressants for global ibs symptoms was moderate, but it was low to very low for all other endpoints and drug classes studied.
interpretation: some gut-brain neuromodulators are efficacious in reducing global symptoms and abdominal pain in ibs. the findings support guidelines that recommend use of tricyclic antidepressants for ongoing global symptoms or abdominal pain but also highlight a potential for ssris to be modestly effective for abdominal pain. more data for snris, azapirones, and tetracyclic antidepressants in ibs are required.

aim: we updated pairwise meta-analyses published in the past and assessed the comparative effectiveness and safety of various fmt delivery modalities for ibs.
methods: pairwise meta-analyses and bayesian nwm were performed. heterogeneity, consistency of results and publication bias were explored.
results: of 510 titles raised by initial search, seven rcts were entered into meta-analyses and nwm. they included 470 patients and controls, in whom four fmt delivery modalities were used, that is via colonoscopy, nasojejunal tube, duodenoscope and capsules per os. in the pairwise meta-analysis, the pooled results showed that overall fmt was not superior to placebo, whereas the subgroup analyses showed that fmt via duodenoscope and nasojejunal tube was superior. the nwm showed that 60-g fmt via duodenoscope had the highest efficacy (or, 26.38; 95% ci, 9.22-75.51) and was by far the highest in the efficacy ranking (sucra, 98.8%).
conclusion: the pooled results showed no overall advantage of fmt over placebo in ibs. however, upper gi delivery (via duodenoscopy or nasojejunal tube) proved to be effective. consequently, well-designed rcts are needed to ensure the efficacy and safety profile before fmt can be applied in everyday clinical practice for ibs patients.",Rokkas T; Hold GL,2023,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,35,4,471-479,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002519,"Rokkas, T., & Hold, G.

materials and methods: we performed a systematic search of the literature using pubmed, embase, ovid medline, and cochrane. meta-analyses were conducted in relative risk (rr) or standard mean difference (smd) using 95% confidence intervals (ci). cochrane risk-of-bias 2 tool (rob2) was employed to evaluate the study quality.
result: of 2,589 potential records, 7 studies with 9 cohorts involving 505 participants were included. meta-analyses showed no significant difference in the short-term (12 weeks) and long-term (12 months) global improvement of ibs symptoms of fmt vs. placebo (rr 0.63, 95% ci 0.39-1.00 and rr 0.88, 95% ci 0.53-1.45, respectively). there were statistically significant differences of short-term ibs-sss improvement (smd -0.58, 95% ci -1.09 to -0.88) and short-term ibs-qol improvement (smd 0.67, 95% ci 0.43-0.91). eight from 9 studies (88.9%) had a low risk of bias. the subgroup analysis revealed the short-term global symptoms improvement in studies with low-risk of bias (rr 0.53, 95% ci 0.35-0.81), studies with well-defined donors (rr 0.31, 95% ci 0.14-0.72), and studies with fmt using colonoscopy (rr 0.66, 95% ci 0.47-0.92). major fmt adverse events are transient and rapidly self-limiting.
conclusion: fmt significantly improved ibs-sss and ibs-qol in the short-term period in ibs patients. however, global symptom improvement showed no significance. well-defined donors and appropriate fecal administration routes appear to be important factors for the successful outcomes of fmt in ibs.

31473156,Gut Microbial Dysbiosis In The Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Case-Control Studies.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is the most common functional digestive condition in the industrialized world. the gut microbiota plays a key role in disease pathogenesis.
objective: a systematic review and meta-analysis on case-control studies was conducted to determine whether there is gut microbial dysbiosis in participants with ibs in comparison with healthy controls and, if so, whether the dysbiosis pattern differs among ibs subtypes and geographic regions.
methods: this review was conducted and reported according to the moose (meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology) 2000 and prisma (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) 2009 guidelines. research articles published up to may 9, 2018 were identified through medline (pubmed), cochrane central register of controlled trials (cochrane library), clinicaltrials.gov, embase, and web of science. study quality was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale. case-control studies of participants with ibs who had undergone quantitative gut microbial stool analysis were included. the primary exposure measure of interest is log10 bacterial counts per gram of stool. meta-analyses were performed to estimate the mean difference (md) in gut microbiota between participants with ibs and healthy controls using the random-effects model with inverse variance in revman 5.3 and r 3.5.1. publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and egger's test. between-study heterogeneity was analyzed using higgins i2 statistic with 95% cis.
results: there were 6,333 unique articles identified; 52 qualified for full-text screening. of these, 23 studies were included for analysis (n=1,340 participants from north america, europe, and asia). overall, the studies were moderate in quality. comparing participants with ibs to healthy controls, lower fecal lactobacillus (md= -0.57 log10 colony-forming unit [cfu]/g; p<0.01) and bifidobacterium (md= -1.04 log10cfu/g; p<0.01), higher escherichia coli (md=0.60 log10cfu/g; p<0.01), and marginally higher enterobacter (md=0.74 log10cfu/g; p=0.05). no difference was found between participants with ibs and healthy controls in fecal bacteroides and enterococcus (p=0.18 and 0.68, respectively). publication bias was not observed except in bifidobacterium (p=0.015). subgroup analyses on participants with diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant ibs showed consistent results with the primary results. a subgroup analysis of chinese studies was consistent with the primary results, except for fecal bacteroides, which was increased in participants with ibs vs healthy controls (md=0.29; 95% ci 0.13 to 0.46; p<0.01). although substantial heterogeneity was detected (i2>75%) in most comparisons, the direction of the effect estimates is relatively consistent across studies.
conclusions: ibs is characterized by gut microbial dysbiosis. prospective, large-scale studies are needed to delineate how gut microbial profiles can be used to guide targeted therapies in this challenging patient population.",Wang L; Alammar N; Singh R; Nanavati J; Song Y; Chaudhary R; Mullin GE,2020,Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,120,4,565-586,10.1016/j.jand.2019.05.015,"Wang, L., Alammar, N., Singh, R., Nanavati, J., Song, Y., Chaudhary, R., & Mullin, G.

34358238,Efficacy Of Probiotic Adjuvant Therapy For Irritable Bowel Syndrome In Children: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"objective: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) affects children's quality of life and learning. the purpose of this research was to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotic adjuvant therapy for ibs in children.
methods: the web of science, pubmed, cochrane library, embase and clinical trials databases were electronically searched for randomized controlled trials (rcts) published prior to january 2021 exploring the use of probiotic adjuvant therapy for ibs in children. strict screening and quality evaluations of the eligible articles were performed independently by 2 researchers. outcome indexes were extracted, and a meta-analysis of the data was performed using revman 5.4.1 and stata 16 software. finally, the risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with the rct bias risk assessment tool recommended in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions (5.1.0).
results: a total of nine rcts were included. in children, probiotics significantly reduced the abdominal pain score (i2 = 95%, smd = -1.15, 95% (-2.05, -0.24), p = 0.01) and subject's global assessment of relief (sgarc) score (i2 = 95%, md = -3.84, 95% (-6.49, -1.20), p = 0.004), increased the rate of abdominal pain treatment success (i2 = 0%, rr = 3.44, 95% (1.73, 6.87), p = 0.0005) and abdominal pain relief (i2 = 40%, rr = 1.48, 95% (0.96, 2.28), p = 0.08), and reduced the frequency of abdominal pain (i2 = 2%, md = -0.82, 95% (-1.57, -0.07), p = 0.03). however, we found that it might not be possible to relieve abdominal pain by increasing the daily intake of probiotics.
conclusions: probiotics are effective at treating abdominal pain caused by ibs in children, however, there was no significant correlation between abdominal pain and the amount of probiotics ingested. more attention should be given to ibs in children, and a standardized evaluation should be adopted.",Xu HL; Zou LL; Chen MB; Wang H; Shen WM; Zheng QH; Cui WY,2021,PloS one,16,8,e0255160,10.1371/journal.pone.0255160,"Xu, H.

33530231,Efficacy Of Opioid Receptor Modulators In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: while irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal diseases in clinical practice, it has diverse pathogenesis. because of its sudden and lingering intractable symptoms, it seriously affects patients work and life. opioid receptors are g protein-coupled receptors distributed across the brain, spinal cord, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, and each of the subtypes has a unique role and specific distribution. they play a role in regulating gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and visceral sensations in the gastrointestinal tract. therefore, this meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of opioid receptor modulators on improving the symptoms of ibs.
methods: searching the key words (irritable bowel syndromes or syndrome, irritable bowel or syndromes, irritable bowel or colon, irritable or irritable colon or colitis, mucous or colitides, mucous or mucous colitides or mucous colitis) and (opioid receptor modulators or eluxadoline or viberzi or asimadoline or loperamide), a preliminary search on pubmed (english), embase (english), cochrane library (english), china national knowledge infrastructure database (cnki, chinese), wanfang (chinese), vip citation databases (chinese) and sinomed (chinese) databases yielded 1023 papers published in english and chinese from inception to july 1, 2019. nine studies were included in the final meta-analysis. because this is a systematic review and meta-analysis, ethical approval is not necessary.
results: the random-effects meta-analysis based on these 9 studies and their 4156 patients found that opioid receptor modulators have a statistically significant beneficial effect on ibs global symptoms (rr = 0.85, 95%ci = 0.79-0.92, p < .01) and bowel movement frequency (smd = -1.26, 95%ci = -2.49--0.04, p < .05), and while there was an improvement trend in stool consistency and quality of life, these findings were not statistically significant.
conclusions: this is the first meta-analysis to examine the use of opioid receptor modulators in ibs, and few adverse events were reported in the available trials. compared with the control group, eluxadolin has a better effect in improving ibs global symptoms and abdominal pain and has statistical significance and showed a low rate of constipation development in ibs patients in comparison with known effects of other opioid receptor modulators. however, current findings are based on a considerably limited evidence base with marked heterogeneity. future studies should aim to identify subpopulations of patients with ibs and need to evaluate the long-term safety of these therapies.prospero registration number: crd42020141597.",Li X; Li B; Zhang J; Chen T; Wu H; Shi X; Ma J; Qin J; Tang X; Wang F,2021,Medicine,100,4,e24361,10.1097/MD.0000000000024361,"Li, X., Li, B., Zhang, J., Chen, T., Wu, H., Shi, X., Ma, J., Qin, J., Tang, X., & Wang, F.

methods: this study was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines. the pubmed, embase, cochrane library, web of science, china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki), chinese scientific journals (vip), wan fang, and chinese biomedical (cbm) databases were electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials comparing external therapy of tcm with western medicine for ibs-d from inception to 31 december 2021. two authors independently screened, extracted, and assessed the selected studies. the jadad scale and cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool were used to evaluate study quality. the certainty of evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations (grade). the meta-analysis was performed using the review manager software (version 5.3).
results: twenty-one studies involving 1,862 subjects were included. acupuncture and moxibustion were the most commonly used external therapies. the meta-analysis showed that based on total effective rate with moderate certainty of evidence (n = 21 studies, n = 1,862 participants, rr = 1.25, 95% ci [1.2, 1.31], i2 = 0%, p < 0.00001), clinical cure rate with low certainty of evidence (n = 17 studies, n = 1,502 participants, rr = 1.66, 95% ci [1.4, 1.96], i2 = 1%, p < 0.00001), recurrence rate with very low certainty of evidence (n = 5 studies, n = 260 participants, rr = 0.44, 95% ci [0.34, 0.58], i2 = 0%, p < 0.00001), total symptom score (md = -4.9, 95% ci [-7.34, -2.47]), and ibs severity scoring system score (ibs-sss) with moderate certainty of evidence (md = -52.72, 95% ci [-63.9, -41.53]), the experimental group had significant advantages compared with the control group. the sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of the primary outcomes. the improvement in quality of life associated with ibs (ibs-qol) was superior in the experimental group compared to the control group, and the difference was statistically significant; however, the clinical heterogeneity was strong. the inverted funnel plot of the included studies indicated a potential publication bias.
conclusion: external therapy of tcm for ibs-d alleviated abdominal symptoms, improved clinical effectiveness, and reduced recurrence with great safety. however, because of the limitations of publication bias in trials, more rigorous studies with a clinical design are necessary for further verification of the outcomes.

40134805,Improvement Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"introduction: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a severe gastrointestinal condition with symptoms like pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptors, expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, have been found to affect gut motility. glp-1 and its analog rose-010 have been shown to inhibit the migrating motor complex and decrease gastrointestinal motility in ibs patients.
aim: this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the efficacy and safety of glp-1 receptor agonists in providing pain and symptom relief for individuals with ibs.
methods: the study conducted extensive searches across various databases, including cochrane library, web of science, pubmed, google scholar, and science direct, to identify studies on ibs and related drugs. a search strategy using keywords and medical subject heading terms (mesh) was developed to ensure inclusivity. exclusion criteria included non-english language studies, books, conference papers, case reports, in vitro studies, animal studies, and non-original articles.
results: the study found that rose-010 (100 μg) significantly lowered pain intensity in ibs patients compared to a placebo, with an overall odds ratio of 2.30, 95% ci: 1.53-3.46. rose-010 (300 μg) is more effective than a placebo for all irritable bowel syndrome subtypes, with consistent effects across trials. rose-010 is linked to a greater incidence of nausea, vomiting, and headache than placebo.
conclusion: rose-010, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has been shown to reduce pain in individuals with ibs. however, its higher frequency of nausea, vomiting, and headache suggests the need for close monitoring and individualized treatment plans. further investigation is needed to understand its impact on different ibs subtypes and long-term effects.

39397617,Silent Struggles Within: Alexithymia Unveiled In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background/aims: in recent years, the presence of alexithymia in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) has gained more attention, and several studies have evaluated this relationship. however, no clear conclusion has been reported yet. therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand the association between ibs and alexithymia.
methods: we performed a systematic search on the medical databases pubmed, embase, and scopus using predefined keywords to identify observational studies assessing the association between ibs and alexithymia. the included studies diagnosed ibs using the rome criteria, and alexithymia was evaluated using the 20-item toronto alexithymia scale (tas-20) score. we used the newcastle-ottawa scale to evaluate the quality of included studies. the primary summary outcome was the mean difference in tas-20 scores.
results: we included 7 studies involving 1,513 individuals in our qualitative analysis, with 6 of them included in our quantitative analysis. all studies were considered to be of satisfactory quality according to the newcastle-ottawa scale criteria. we found significantly higher tas-20 scores in ibs patients compared to controls (8.063 [95% ci, 2.554-13.572]). however, no significant mean difference in tas-20 scores was observed in ibs vs inflammatory bowel disease patients (0.884 [95% ci -2.536-4.304]).
conclusions: we demonstrated that ibs is associated with an increased risk of developing alexithymia. however, our study did not show a significant difference in tas-20 scores between patients with ibs compared to inflammatory bowel disease.",Ismaiel A; Foucambert P; Ismaiel M; Leucuta DC; Popa SL; Baban A; Dumitrascu DL,2024,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,30,4,387-396,10.5056/jnm23159,"Ismaiel, A., Foucambert, P., Ismaiel, M., Leucuta, D.

33909790,Interventions For The Treatment Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review Of Cochrane Systematic Reviews.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a complex gastrointestinal disorder, whose understanding is relatively uncertain, and the treatment guidance decision still represents a challenge.
objective: to identify and critically appraise systematic reviews (srs) published in the cochrane database of srs (cdsr) on the effects of interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for the treatment of ibs.
methods: the search was conducted at the cochrane library in may 2020. the methodological quality of the srs was evaluated by the amstar-2 tool.
results: eight srs with moderate to high quality were included, which addressed the treatments: (a) pharmacological: volume agents, antispasmodics, antidepressants and tegaserod; and (b) non-pharmacological: homeopathy, acupuncture, phytotherapy, biofeedback, psychological interventions and hypnotherapy. the results were favorable to antispasmodic drugs and antidepressants regarding the improvement of clinical symptoms. there was no difference between volume agents or tegaserod when compared to placebo. acupuncture and homeopathy showed a little improvement in symptoms compared to placebo, but the certainty of this evidence was considered low to very low. psychological interventions seem to improve the overall assessment of the patient and relief symptoms such as abdominal pain. however, there was no long-term follow-up of these patients. the results of the other treatments were considered uncertain due to the high risk of bias.
conclusion: considering the low quality of the studies included in the srs, pharmacological treatment with antispasmodics and antidepressants seems to be beneficial for patients with ibs. among non-pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions seem to be beneficial. however, further clinical trials are recommended with greater methodological rigor to prove these findings.",Scaciota ACL; Matos D; Rosa MMB; Colovati MES; Bellotto EFBC; Martimbianco ALC,2021,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,58,1,120-126,10.1590/S0004-2803.202100000-20,"Scaciota, A.

39760236,The Developmental Origins Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"objectives: the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) framework contends that chronic diseases are attributable to behavioral and environmental risks encountered during vital periods of fetal and childhood development. clinical research investigating irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) largely focuses on adult risk factors, with emerging evidence of epigenetic contributions. limited work considers potential childhood exposures. this paper applies a life course approach to the study of ibs, exploring the available evidence to ascertain the potential developmental origins of ibs.
methods: a systematic literature review was conducted adhering to moose and prisma protocols, identifying papers from 1970 through april 2024 examining all ibs risk factors during the prenatal, postnatal, childhood, and adolescent periods. data were extracted from screened papers and analyzed via meta-analysis using a random effects model.
results: a total of 27 case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies were identified for analysis. the meta-analysis revealed significant childhood risk factors for adult ibs, including family history (pooled or 2.17, 95% ci 1.89-2.49, p < 0.0001, n = 11) and the occurrence of any childhood trauma event (pooled or 1.61, 95% ci 1.29-2.01, p < 0.0001, n = 6). physical and sexual trauma were the strongest trauma predictors. factors including breastfeeding and cesarean section were not significant.
conclusions: this study found ibs is strongly predicted by traumatic childhood experiences, as well as having an immediate family member with ibs. these demonstrated environmental and genetic components indicate a potential gene-environment interaction during childhood, suggesting a need for primary research to better understand the developmental origins of ibs.",Lenover Moyer MB; Jasani K; Waldman AB; Chinchilli VM; Shenk MK,2025,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,37,1,e24209,10.1002/ajhb.24209,"Lenover Moyer, M.

methods: randomized controlled trials (rcts) of trimebutine combined with probiotics for the treatment of ibs were collected from various databases. all retrieved articles were screened and assessed for quality. the methodological quality of the included studies was assessed following the guidelines recommended by the cochrane collaboration. the meta-analysis of the included studies was conducted using revman 5.3 software.
results: a total of 37 rcts involving 4360 participants were included in this study. among them, the treatment group consisted of 2177 participants, and the control group consisted of 2183 participants. the results showed that the overall efficacy of trimebutine combined with probiotics in the treatment of ibs was significantly higher than that of trimebutine alone (odds ratio [or] = 5.09, 95 % confidence interval [ci] [4.19, 6.20], p < 0.00001). the effective rate in the combination therapy group was 93.5 % compared with 73.8 % in the trimebutine alone group. the safety profile was favorable, with adverse event rates of 1.75 % and 1.69 % in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively. the most common adverse events were mild and included dry mouth, nausea and dizziness. no serious adverse events were reported in either group. subgroup analysis based on the type of probiotic intervention showed that combination use was better than trimebutine alone, and the differences between each subgroup were statistically significant. combination use of compound lactobacillus capsules had the best effect (or = 16.03, 95 % ci [4.57, 56.21], p < 0.0001]. these results highlight the potential role of strain-specific benefits in ibs treatment and suggest that probiotic strain selection may significantly influence treatment outcomes.
conclusions: the combination of trimebutine and probiotics is more effective in the treatment of ibs compared with trimebutine alone.

34236740,Current Status Of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation For Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common gastrointestinal functional disorder. although ibs is a benign condition, it reduces the quality of life considerably. while there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder, fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) seems to be promising.
purpose: the aim of this review was to analysis possible factors affecting the success or failure of the randomized controlled trials (rcts) of fmt for ibs and highlighting the gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled and of sketching a possible model for successful fmt in ibs patients.
methods: a systematic search was conducted of literature published in english from january 2015 to december 2020 using the keywords: fecal microbiota transplantation, randomized trials, and ibs.
key results: seven randomized controlled trials (rcts) on the efficacy of fmt for ibs were found in the literature. four of the seven rcts found various positive effects, while the other three did not find any effect.
conclusions and inferences: the efficacy of fmt for ibs appears to be donor-dependent. the effective (super) donor would need to have a favorable microbiota signature, and 11 clinical criteria that are known to be associated with a favorable microbiota have been suggested for selecting fmt donors for ibs. comparing the microbiota of the effective donors with those of healthy subjects would reveal the favorable microbiota signature required for a super-donor. however, the studies reviewed were not designed to compare efficacy of different donor types. the dose of the fecal transplant is also an important factor influencing the outcome of fmt for ibs. however, further studies designed to test the effect of fecal transplant dose are needed to answer this question. administering the fecal transplant to either the small or large intestine seems to be effective, but the optimal route of administration remains to be determined. moreover, whether single or repeated fmt is more effective is also still unclear. a 1-year follow-up of ibs patients who received fmt showed that adverse events of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation were both mild and self-limiting.",El-Salhy M; Hausken T; Hatlebakk JG,2021,Neurogastroenterology and motility,33,11,e14157,10.1111/nmo.14157,"El-Salhy, M., Hausken, T., & Hatlebakk, J.

38064310,Blood Salvage And Autotransfusion During Orthotopic Liver Transplantation For Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"background: hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is a significant cause of oncologic mortality worldwide. liver transplantation represents a curative option for patients with significant liver dysfunction and absence of metastases. however, this therapeutic option is associated with significant blood loss and frequently requires various transfusions and intraoperative blood salvage for autotransfusion (ibs-at) with or without a leukocyte reduction filter. this study aimed to analyze available evidence on long-term oncologic outcomes of patients undergoing liver transplantation for hcc with and without ibs-at.
methods: per prisma guidelines, a systematic review of keywords ""blood salvage,"" ""auto-transfusion,"" ""hepatocellular carcinoma,"" and ""liver-transplant"" was conducted in pubmed, embase, and scopus. studies comparing operative and postoperative outcomes were screened and analyzed for review.
results: twelve studies totaling 1704 participants were included for analysis. length of stay, recurrence rates, and overall survival were not different between ibs-at group and non ibs-at group.
conclusion: ibs-at use is not associated with increased risk of recurrence in liver transplant for hcc even without leukocyte filtration. both operative and postoperative outcomes are similar between groups. comparison of analyzed studies suggest that ibs-at is safe for use during liver transplant for hcc.",Hinojosa-Gonzalez DE; Salgado-Garza G; Tellez-Garcia E; Escarcega-Bordagaray JA; Bueno-Gutierrez LC; Madrazo-Aguirre K; Muñoz-Hibert MI; Diaz-Garza KG; Ramirez-Mulhern I; Alvarez de la Reguera-Babb R; Flores-Villalba E; Rodarte-Shade M; Gonzalez-Urquijo M,2024,Clinical transplantation,38,1,e15222,10.1111/ctr.15222,"Hinojosa-Gonzalez, D.

39839290,Efficacy Of Fermented Foods In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"objective: fermented foods (ffs) may theoretically benefit irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) symptoms, but the role of ffs for ibs patients in the real world is inconsistent and has not been systematically assessed. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine this issue.
methods: pubmed, medline, embase and cochrane library databases were searched up to august 2024. randomized controlled trials (rcts) investigating the efficacy of ffs in ibs were eligible for the analysis. two authors independently screened studies and extracted data. data were pooled using relative risk (rr) of dichotomous data and standardized mean difference (smd) for continuous data.
results: a total of 16 rcts with 1,264 ibs patients were included. there were 12 rcts involving 975 patients providing primary outcomes which was defined as symptom relief. the proportion of symptom relief was associated with the administration of ffs (rr 1.22, 95% ci 1.04-1.42, p = 0.01, i 2 = 0%). for secondary outcomes, ffs also exerted a beneficial effect on global symptoms scores (smd = -0.15; 95% ci -0.29 to -0.02, p = 0.02, i 2 = 46%), but no significant improvement on abdominal pain scores and bloating scores. subgroup analysis showed that fermented milk had a beneficial effect on symptom relief (rr 1.19, 95% ci 1.01 to 1.39, p = 0.04, i 2 = 0%).
conclusion: fermented foods, especially fermented milk with probiotics properties, appear to be efficacious in irritable bowel syndrome. however, given the limitations of current evidence, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution.

40831637,A Bibliometric Analysis Of Global Research Status And Trends In Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Gut Microbiota Metabolites.,"background: metabolites derived from the gut microbiota are substantial contributors to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). as our understanding of the mechanisms underlying gut microbiota metabolites advances, significant progress has been made in research exploring the correlation between gut microbiota metabolites and ibs. nevertheless, a comprehensive synthesis of research foci and trends in this domain is still lacking. consequently, integrating scientometric methods with a range of analytical tools can facilitate the identification of key research areas and potential future study directions.
methods: the present study employed scientometric tools, including vosviewer, bibliometrix software, citespace, tableau, and r software, to collect and analyze research literature on ibs and gut microbiota metabolites. this comprised an analysis of journal publications and their impact, the identification of prolific authors, the establishment of national research collaboration networks, and the co-occurrence analysis of keywords.
results: the analysis revealed that, following screening, a total of 1,489 documents were obtained, with a gradual increase in the number of publications starting from 2006. the united states, china, and the united kingdom have been identified as the primary hubs of this research field. the leading research institutions were identified as university college cork, the mayo clinic, and the university of california. in the domain of research under discussion, john f. cryan, timothy g. dinan, and gerard clarke are the most prominent authors. multiple analyses of the keywords revealed that research on gut microbiota metabolites in irritable bowel syndrome primarily focuses on the functions and mechanisms of action of specific metabolites (1). emerging research hotspots on gut microbial metabolites influencing ibs are centered on bile acids. in contrast, chain fatty acids have been the most studied metabolites in past research. (2) gut microbiota metabolites primarily affect ibs through the critical role of the gut-brain axis and are closely associated with anxiety-like behaviors.

35295757,Efficacy Of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"background: randomized controlled trials (rcts) have examined the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) with inconsistent results. we performed a meta-analysis to assess both the short- and long-term efficacy of fmt in ibs.
methods: medline, embase, and the cochrane central register were searched through september 2021. rcts recruiting adult patients with ibs that compared fmt with placebo with dichotomous data of response to therapy were eligible. dichotomous data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (rr) of symptom not improving after therapy. rr was also pooled for adverse events (aes). continuous data were calculated using a mean difference for ibs-quality of life (ibs-qol). grade methodology was used to assess quality of evidence.
results: the search strategy generated 658 citations. seven rcts comprising 472 patients with ibs were included. fmt was not associated with a significant improvement in global symptom in ibs at 12 weeks in comparison with placebo (rr 0.75, 95% ci 0.43-1.31) with high heterogeneity between studies (i2 87%). subgroup analyses showed that fmt was superior to placebo when administered via colonoscopy or gastroscope (rr 0.70, 95% ci 0.51-0.96; rr 0.37, 95% ci 0.14-0.99, respectively, while fmt was inferior to placebo when administered via oral capsules (rr 1.88, 95% ci 1.06-3.35). fmt induced a significant improvement in ibs-qol compared to placebo (mean difference 9.39, 95% ci 3.86-14.91) at 12 weeks. no significant difference in the total number of aes was observed between fmt and placebo (rr 1.20, 95% ci 0.59-2.47). fmt did not significantly improve global symptom in ibs at 1-year follow-up compared with placebo (rr 0.90, 95% ci 0.72-1.12). the grade quality evidence to support recommending fmt in ibs was very low.

34976247,Probiotics In Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Is The Quest For The Right Strain Over? Rapid Review Of Existing Guidelines And Recommendations.,"irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) - functional gastrointestinal disorder (fgids) and disorder of gut-brain interaction (dgbis) - has emerged as an important medical problem with an impact on health care systems, affecting patients' quality of life. the management of ibs consists of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments; however, the data of their long-term efficacy are scarce. modulation of gastrointestinal microbiota, by means of probiotics and prebiotics, is often sought and advertised as a popular treatment modality in ibs. faecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) awaits recommendations for ibs treatment and requires more methodological assessments. to date, numerous guidelines and recommendations have been published on the role of probiotics in ibs. because no probiotic claim for probiotics in foods has yet been granted by the european food and safety authority (efsa), medical practitioners still recommend probiotics on the basis of available literature and recommendations released by independent health authorities. we aimed to summarize published formal recommendations and guidelines regarding the clinical effectiveness of available probiotic strains and conduct a random-effects meta-analysis of outcomes for which ≥ 2 studies contributed data on the same probiotic strain recommended to adults with ibs. based on available and most recent guidelines, we report that probiotics, as a group, may be an effective treatment for global symptoms and abdominal pain in ibs, with the strongest effect for genus lactobacillus. our current and updated meta-analysis is in line with several reports documenting significant effects of lactobacillus plantarum (lp299v) in reducing the risk of global symptoms and their persistence, which could assist clinicians in making the choice for the right probiotic strain in ibs patients.",Marlicz W; Skonieczna-Żydecka K; Krynicka P; Łoniewski I; Rydzewska G,2021,Przeglad gastroenterologiczny,16,4,369-382,10.5114/pg.2021.111766,"Marlicz, W., Skonieczna-Żydecka, K., Krynicka, P., Łoniewski, I., & Rydzewska, G.

38158460,Getting The Bs Out Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhea (Ibs-D): Let'S Make A Diagnosis.,"purpose of review: irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (ibs-d) is diagnosed when chronic symptoms of abdominal pain accompany loose stools, and alarm features, such as fever, anemia, rectal bleeding, and weight loss are absent. this combination of symptoms makes structural disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, unlikely, but does not exclude other conditions that cause these symptoms. the question is whether making a ""positive diagnosis"" of ibs-d based on symptoms alone and instituting therapy based on that diagnosis still makes sense.
recent findings: clinical observations suggest that at least two-thirds of cases of ibs-d can be explained by three mechanisms: a) food intolerances (~ 30-40%), b) bile acid diarrhea (~ 20-30%), and c) disturbed microbial flora (~ 15-20%). other conditions that are less frequent but can cause ibs symptoms or be confused with ibs include: celiac disease, microscopic colitis, mastocytosis/mast cell activation, and drug side-effects. many cases of ibs-d have a discoverable, underlying cause that can direct therapy more efficiently.",Frissora CL; Schiller LR,2024,Current gastroenterology reports,26,1,20-29,10.1007/s11894-023-00909-1,"Frissora, C.

39998756,Placebo Response Variability On Health-Related Quality Of Life Outcomes In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Arm-Based Network Meta-Analysis.,"objectives: the impact of placebo response on health outcomes in various diseases, including ibs, is significant. to better understand the effect of different placebo administration methods on the observed outcomes in ibs studies, this meta-analysis aims to explore research findings on the degree of improvement.
methods: the meta-analysis included 45 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 5174 patients with confirmed ibs (excluding those with significant comorbidities). the trials were designed to compare the efficacy of different placebo interventions. the primary outcome was the irritable bowel syndrome severity scoring system (ibs-sss), and secondary outcomes included the irritable bowel syndrome quality of life instrument (ibs-qol) and the ibs symptom visual analog scale (vas). an arm-based bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to examine the relative effectiveness of the placebo interventions on the outcomes.
results: the analysis revealed that sham moxibustion exhibited the most significant efficacy in reducing ibs-sss (md -260.00, 95% cris: -288.00 to -232.00). additionally, sham fmt resulted in significant improvements in ibs-qol scores (md 9.23, 95% cris - 3.69 to 22.30). meanwhile, placebo tablet interventions were found to be the most effective in reducing vas scores (md 4.71, 95% cris, -1.14 to 11.10). overall, this synthesis provides detailed insights into the effectiveness of placebos in addressing different outcome measures.
conclusions: sham moxibustion appears to provide subjective benefits for patients' ibs symptoms. however, the evidence for its efficacy is less robust compared to other interventions, as assessed by grade. understanding the placebo effect in ibs management is crucial for clinical practice and drug development, particularly in placebo comparisons.

38643935,Rome Iii Criteria Capture Higher Irritable Bowel Syndrome Snp-Heritability And Highlight A Novel Genetic Link With Cardiovascular Traits.,"background & aims: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) shows genetic predisposition, and large-scale genome-wide association studies (gwas) are emerging, based on heterogeneous disease definitions. we investigated the genetic architecture of ibs defined according to gold standard rome criteria.
methods: we conducted gwas meta-analyses of rome iii ibs and its subtypes in 24,735 ibs cases and 77,149 asymptomatic control subjects from 2 independent european cohorts (uk biobank and lifelines). single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp)-based heritability (h2snp) and genetic correlations (rg) with other traits were calculated. ibs risk loci were functionally annotated to identify candidate genes. sensitivity and conditional analyses were conducted to assess impact of confounders. polygenic risk scores were computed and tested in independent datasets.
results: rome iii ibs showed significant snp-heritability (up to 13%) and similar genetic architecture across subtypes, including those with manifestations at the opposite ends of the symptom spectrum (rg = 0.48 between ibs-d and ibs-c). genetic correlations with other traits highlighted commonalities with family history of heart disease and hypertension, coronary artery disease, and angina pectoris (rg = 0.20-0.45), among others. four independent gwas signals (p < 5×10-8) were detected, including 2 novel loci for ibs (rs2035380) and ibs-mixed (rs2048419) that had been previously associated with hypertension and coronary artery disease. functional annotation of gwas risk loci revealed genes implicated in circadian rhythm (bmal1), intestinal barrier (cldn23), immunomodulation (mfhas1), and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway (adcy2). polygenic risk scores allowed the identification of individuals at increased risk of ibs (odds ratio, 1.34; p = 1.1×10-3).

38439604,Major Depressive Disorder And The Risk Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"background: the association between major depressive disorder (mdd) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) has been found in observational research; however, the causative relationship between mdd and ibs remains uncertain. using the two-sample mendelian randomization (mr) approach, we attempted to examine the causal effect of mdd on ibs.
methods: independent genetic variants for mdd identified by howard et al. based on a genome-wide meta-analysis were selected for this study. gene-outcome associations for ibs were gathered from uk biobank and finngen databases. the mr analysis included inverse variance weighted (ivw), mr-egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and mr-presso sensitivity analyses.
results: finngen database subjected to inverse variance weighted (ivw) analysis revealed that mdd may be a risk factor for the development of ibs (or = 1.356, 95% ci: 1.125-1.632, p = 0.0013). the same finding was reached in uk biobank for ivw (or = 1.011, 95% ci: 1.006-1.015, p = 3.18 × 10-7 ), mr-egger progression (or = 1.030, 95% ci: 1.008-1.051, p = 0.007), and weighted median (or = 1.011, 95% ci: 1.005-1.016, p = 0.0001).
conclusion: our findings supported a causal relationship between mdd and ibs, which may have implications for the clinical management of ibs in individuals with mdd.",Zhu R; Zhang N; Zhu H; Li F; Xu H,2024,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,12,3,e2413,10.1002/mgg3.2413,"Zhu, R., Zhang, N., Zhu, H., Li, F., & Xu, H.

32180822,Vedolizumab In The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Evolving Paradigms.,"inflammatory bowel diseases, comprising crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), are chronic, relapsing and remitting immune-mediated inflammatory diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract. vedolizumab is the first licensed drug in a group of 'gut-selective' biological agents used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. the gemini registrational trials established the efficacy of vedolizumab for the induction and maintenance of remission in both cd and uc, with the most favourable results in tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-antagonist-naive patients. in recent years, a wealth of 'real-world' data has emerged supporting positive clinical, endoscopic and histological outcomes in patients treated with vedolizumab (vdz) as well as reassuring safety data. more recently, the results of the first head-to-head trials of vdz and tnf antagonists have been reported, as well as the results of a number of studies exploring the role of therapeutic drug monitoring with vdz. this review brings together data reported on vdz to date, including from the gemini trials, real-world data and emerging studies regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and immunogenicity. the safety profile of vdz is also reviewed. evolving treatment paradigms are explored, including data regarding the role of vdz in perianal cd, post-operative complications and recurrence, extraintestinal manifestations and pregnancy.",Crooks B; Barnes T; Limdi JK,2020,Drugs in context,9,,,10.7573/dic.2019-10-2,"Crooks, B., Barnes, T., & Limdi, J.
