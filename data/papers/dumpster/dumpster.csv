34376515,Efficacy Of A Low Fodmap Diet In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) is recommended for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), if general lifestyle and dietary advice fails. However, although the impact of a low FODMAP diet on individual IBS symptoms has been examined in some randomised controlled trials (RCTs), there has been no recent systematic assessment, and individual trials have studied numerous alternative or control interventions, meaning the best comparator is unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis addressing these uncertainties.
DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through to 2 April 2021 to identify RCTs of a low FODMAP diet in IBS. Efficacy was judged using dichotomous assessment of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs, and interventions ranked according to their P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs (944 patients). Based on failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms, a low FODMAP diet ranked first vs habitual diet (RR of symptoms not improving=0.67; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91, P-score=0.99), and was superior to all other interventions. Low FODMAP diet ranked first for abdominal pain severity, abdominal bloating or distension severity and bowel habit, although for the latter it was not superior to any other intervention. A low FODMAP diet was superior to British Dietetic Association (BDA)/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) dietary advice for abdominal bloating or distension (RR=0.72; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94). BDA/NICE dietary advice was not superior to any other intervention in any analysis.
CONCLUSION: In a network analysis, low FODMAP diet ranked first for all endpoints studied. However, most trials were based in secondary or tertiary care and did not study effects of FODMAP reintroduction and personalisation on symptoms.",Black CJ; Staudacher HM; Ford AC,2022,Gut,71,6,1117-1126,10.1136/gutjnl-2021-325214,"Black, C.

36157114,"Gut Microbiota, Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Colorectal Cancer.","The gut microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tracts of humans, living in symbiosis with the host. Dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance between the beneficial and opportunistic gut microbiota, is associated with several gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represented by ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and colorectal cancer (CRC). Dysbiosis can disrupt the mucosal barrier, resulting in perpetuation of inflammation and carcinogenesis. The increase in some specific groups of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), has been associated with chronic tissue inflammation and the release of pro-inflammatory and carcinogenic mediators, increasing the chance of developing CRC, following the inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence in IBD patients. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to analyze the correlation between changes in the gut microbiota and the development and maintenance of IBD, CRC, and IBD-associated CRC. Patients with IBD and CRC have shown reduced bacterial diversity and abundance compared to healthy individuals, with enrichment of Firmicute sand Bacteroidetes. Specific bacteria are also associated with the onset and progression of CRC, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, and ETBF. Future research can evaluate the advantages of modulating the gut microbiota as preventive measures in CRC high-risk patients, directly affecting the prognosis of the disease and the quality of life of patients.",Quaglio AEV; Grillo TG; De Oliveira ECS; Di Stasi LC; Sassaki LY,2022,World journal of gastroenterology,28,30,4053-4060,10.3748/wjg.v28.i30.4053,"Quaglio, A.

37513532,High-Fiber Diet And Crohn'S Disease: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CD is a health problem in Western countries such as the US and European nations and is an idiopathic disease; however, certain cases of CD have been associated with intestinal dysbiosis. A systematic review with a meta-analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of a diet rich in fiber with or without cointervention to improve remission rates for CD. The literature in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases was reviewed. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Johanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. This review was conducted in accordance with the structure outlined in the PRISMA statement. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a random effects model. Eleven studies were included, totaling 2389 patients with CD. Applying a diet rich in fiber with or without the administration of routine therapies improved CD remission rates. Data regarding CD activity, remission time, and adverse effects derived from fiber consumption were analyzed.

35942669,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Efficacy Of Peppermint Oil In Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, with a complex pathophysiology. Antispasmodics are prescribed as first-line therapy because of their action on gut dysmotility. In this regard, peppermint oil also has antispasmodic properties.
AIM: To update our previous meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of peppermint oil, particularly as recent studies have cast doubt on its role in the treatment of IBS METHODS: We searched the medical literature up to 2nd April 2022 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of peppermint oil in IBS. Efficacy and safety were judged using dichotomous assessments of effect on global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain, and occurrence of any adverse event or of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We identified 10 eligible RCTs (1030 patients). Peppermint oil was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptoms (RR of not improving = 0.65; 95% CI 0.43-0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4; 95% CI 2.5-71), and abdominal pain (RR of abdominal pain not improving = 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.93, NNT = 7; 95% CI 4-24). Adverse event rates were significantly higher with peppermint oil (RR of any adverse event = 1.57; 95% CI 1.04-2.37).
CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint oil was superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS, but adverse events were more frequent, and quality of evidence was very low.

33585949,Efficacy Of A Low-Fodmap Diet In Adult Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"PURPOSE: This review provides an updated overview of observational and intervention studies investigating the effect of a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols) diet (LFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, quality of life (QoL), nutritional adequacy, and gut microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.
METHODS: We systematically searched available literature until October 2020 for studies that investigated the effect of LFDs on GI symptoms, QoL, nutritional adequacy, and the gut microbiome in IBS patients. The data were represented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for IBS severity, and as mean differences (MD) for IBS-QoL. Meta-analyses were performed for the quantitative analyses using random effects models with inverse variance weighing.
RESULTS: Twelve papers (nine parallel trials, three crossover studies) were included for the meta-analysis. The LFD reduced IBS severity by a moderate-to-large extent as compared to a control diet (SMD - 0.66, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.44, I2 = 54%). When analyzing only studies that used the validated IBS-SSS questionnaire, a mean reduction of 45 points (95% CI - 77, - 14; I2 = 89%) was observed. Subgroup analyses on adherence, age, intervention duration, IBS subtype, outcome measure, and risk of bias revealed no significantly different results. The LFD also increased IBS-QoL scores, when compared with a control diet (MD 4.93; 95% CI 1.77, 8.08; I2 = 42%).
CONCLUSIONS: The low-FODMAP diet reduces GI symptoms and improves quality of life in IBS subjects as compared to control diets. Future work is required to obtain definitive answers regarding potential long-term effects of such diets on nutritional adequacy and the gut microbiome.

32276950,Efficacy Of Psychological Therapies For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: National guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) recommend that psychological therapies should be considered, but their relative efficacy is unknown, because there have been few head-to-head trials. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to try to resolve this uncertainty.
DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through January 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of psychological therapies for adults with IBS, compared with each other, or a control intervention. Trials reported a dichotomous assessment of symptom status after completion of therapy. We pooled data using a random effects model. Efficacy was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic, with a 95% CI to summarise efficacy of each comparison tested, and ranked by therapy according to P score.
RESULTS: We identified 41 eligible RCTs, containing 4072 participants. After completion of therapy, the psychological interventions with the largest numbers of trials, and patients recruited, demonstrating efficacy included self-administered or minimal contact cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83, P score 0.66), face-to-face CBT (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80, P score 0.65) and gut-directed hypnotherapy (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91, P score 0.57). After completion of therapy, among trials recruiting only patients with refractory symptoms, group CBT and gut-directed hypnotherapy were more efficacious than either education and/or support or routine care, and CBT via the telephone, contingency management, CBT via the internet and dynamic psychotherapy were all superior to routine care. Risk of bias of trials was high, with evidence of funnel plot asymmetry; the efficacy of psychological therapies is therefore likely to have been overestimated.
CONCLUSIONS: Several psychological therapies are efficacious for IBS, although none were superior to another. CBT-based interventions and gut-directed hypnotherapy had the largest evidence base and were the most efficacious long term.

33811041,Long-Term Dietary Patterns Are Associated With Pro-Inflammatory And Anti-Inflammatory Features Of The Gut Microbiome.,"OBJECTIVE: The microbiome directly affects the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the gut. As microbes thrive on dietary substrates, the question arises whether we can nourish an anti-inflammatory gut ecosystem. We aim to unravel interactions between diet, gut microbiota and their functional ability to induce intestinal inflammation.
DESIGN: We investigated the relation between 173 dietary factors and the microbiome of 1425 individuals spanning four cohorts: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and the general population. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to profile gut microbial composition and function. Dietary intake was assessed through food frequency questionnaires. We performed unsupervised clustering to identify dietary patterns and microbial clusters. Associations between diet and microbial features were explored per cohort, followed by a meta-analysis and heterogeneity estimation.
RESULTS: We identified 38 associations between dietary patterns and microbial clusters. Moreover, 61 individual foods and nutrients were associated with 61 species and 249 metabolic pathways in the meta-analysis across healthy individuals and patients with IBS, Crohn's disease and UC (false discovery rate<0.05). Processed foods and animal-derived foods were consistently associated with higher abundances of Firmicutes, Ruminococcus species of the Blautia genus and endotoxin synthesis pathways. The opposite was found for plant foods and fish, which were positively associated with short-chain fatty acid-producing commensals and pathways of nutrient metabolism.
CONCLUSION: We identified dietary patterns that consistently correlate with groups of bacteria with shared functional roles in both, health and disease. Moreover, specific foods and nutrients were associated with species known to infer mucosal protection and anti-inflammatory effects. We propose microbial mechanisms through which the diet affects inflammatory responses in the gut as a rationale for future intervention studies.",Bolte LA; Vich Vila A; Imhann F; Collij V; Gacesa R; Peters V; Wijmenga C; Kurilshikov A; Campmans-Kuijpers MJE; Fu J; Dijkstra G; Zhernakova A; Weersma RK,2021,Gut,70,7,1287-1298,10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322670,"Bolte, L.

34757139,Efficacy Of Biologic Drugs In Short-Duration Versus Long-Duration Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And An Individual-Patient Data Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Starting biologic treatment early in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be associated with higher efficacy, especially in Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: This was a systematic review and individual-patient data meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of biologics approved for IBD at study inception (October 2015), using Vivli data-sharing platform. The primary outcome was the proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission in patients with short-duration (≤18 months) vs long-duration disease (>18 months) analyzed separately for CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). We used meta-regression to examine the impact of patients' characteristics on the primary outcome.
RESULTS: We included 25 trials, testing infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab (6168 patients with CD and 3227 patients with UC). In CD, remission induction rates were higher in pooled placebo and patients in active arms with short-duration disease of ≤18 months (41.4% [244 of 589]) compared with disease duration of >18 months (29.8% [852 of 2857], meta-analytically estimated odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.64). The primary outcome, proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission, was not different in short-duration disease of ≤18 months (n = 589, odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.15) compared with longer disease duration (n = 2857, odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.72). In UC trials, both the proportional biologic/placebo remission-induction effect and the pooled biologic-placebo effect were stable, regardless of disease duration. Primary outcome results remained unchanged when tested using alternative temporal cutoffs and when modeled for individual patient's covariates, including prior anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: There are higher rates of induction of remission with biologics and with placebo in early CD, resulting in a treatment to placebo effect ratio that is similar across disease durations. No such relationships between disease duration and outcomes was found in UC.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, our primary aim was to comprehensively assess the therapeutic effectiveness and safety profile of upadacitinib in the treatment of patients with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature search across prominent databases, including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, to identify pertinent studies providing insights into the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in IBD. The primary endpoint was the achievement of clinical remission, while secondary endpoints encompassed clinical response, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and the evaluation of adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: In this meta-analysis of nine studies, we categorized results by study type. Clinical remission rates were: RCTs 36 % (95 % CI = 30-42 %), real-world studies 25 % (95 % CI = 1-49 %), retrospective studies 40 % (95 % CI = 24-56 %), cohort studies 55 % (95 % CI = 25-85 %). Clinical response rates were: RCTs 61 % (95 % CI = 55-67 %), real-world studies 42 % (95 % CI = 14-70 %), cohort studies 65 % (95 % CI = 57-73 %). Endoscopic remission rates were: RCTs 19 % (95 % CI = 15-24 %), cohort studies 29 % (95 % CI = 5-52 %). Endoscopic response rates were: RCTs 41 % (95 % CI = 36-47 %), cohort studies 57 % (95 % CI = 31-83 %).

37202602,Nightshade Vegetables: A Dietary Trigger For Worsening Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Irritable Bowel Syndrome?,"The Solanaceae family of plants, commonly known as Nightshade vegetables or Nightshades, contains a diverse range of crops of over 2000 members with significant culinary, economic, and cultural importance. Familiar edible Nightshades include tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and white potatoes. Many pharmacologically active compounds used in traditional medicine, including atropine and hyoscyamine, are derived from Nightshades. In addition to these beneficial pharmacologic agents, Nightshade-derived glycoalkaloid compounds, a key defense mechanism against predation, have been shown to disrupt intestinal epithelium and to potentially activate mast cells in the gut mucosa, leading to adverse symptoms in humans. There is a new appreciation that mast cell activation is an allergic inflammatory mechanism contributing both to pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given their ubiquity in Western diets and their shared glycoalkaloid active compounds, edible Nightshades are attracting new interest as a potential trigger for worsening gut symptoms in functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders. Here, we review the limited existing literature on the adverse effects of Nightshade consumption, including the effects of Nightshade-derived glycoalkaloids on IBD gut inflammation, and the under-recognized contribution of Nightshades to food allergies and allergic cross-reactivity.

35631213,A Low-Fodmap Diet Provides Benefits For Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms But Not For Improving Stool Consistency And Mucosal Inflammation In Ibd: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet (LFD) is claimed to improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms (FGSs). However, the role of LFD in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with FGSs remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the efficacy of LFD in IBD patients with FGSs.
METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception to 1 January 2022. Data were synthesized as the relative risk of symptoms improvement and normal stool consistency, mean difference of Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QoL), Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBi), Mayo score, and fecal calprotectin (FC). Risk of bias was assessed based on study types. A funnel plot and Egger's test were used to analyze publication bias.
RESULTS: This review screened and included nine eligible studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five before-after studies, involving a total of 446 participants (351 patients with LFD vs. 95 controls). LFD alleviated overall FGSs (RR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33-0.66, p = 0.0000) and obtained higher SIBDQ scores (MD = 11.24, 95% CI 6.61 to 15.87, p = 0.0000) and lower HBi score of Crohn's disease (MD = -1.09, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.42, p = 0.002). However, there were no statistically significant differences in normal stool consistency, BSFS, IBS-QoL, Mayo score of ulcerative colitis, and FC. No publication bias was found.
CONCLUSIONS: LFD provides a benefit in FGSs and QoL but not for improving stool consistency and mucosal inflammation in IBD patients.

31859183,"Efficacy Of Soluble Fibre, Antispasmodic Drugs, And Gut-Brain Neuromodulators In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Although novel therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) continue to be developed, many doctors rely on more established, traditional therapies as first-line or second-line treatment options. These therapies include soluble fibre (eg, ispaghula husk), antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators (including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or α-2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands). However, the relative efficacy of traditional treatments in patients with IBS is unclear because there have been few head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to compare and rank the efficacy of traditional therapies in patients with IBS to help inform clinical decisions.
METHODS: For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to week 2 of August 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials or supplementary data published up to Aug 18, 2019; and gastroenterology conference proceedings for study abstracts published between 2001 and Aug 18, 2019. We included RCTs that compared any of these treatments with each other (head-to-head trials) or with placebo, in which the efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, or gut-brain neuromodulators was assessed in adults (aged at least 18 years) with IBS of any subtype after 4-12 weeks of treatment. Only RCTs reporting a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, in terms of either improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in abdominal pain, were included. The efficacy and safety of all treatments were reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and treatments were ranked according to their P-score.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 5863 references, of which 81 were screened for eligibility. 51 RCTs with data from 4644 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis, but only 13 of these trials were at low risk of bias. Based on an endpoint of failure to achieve improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, peppermint oil capsules were ranked first for efficacy (RR 0·63, 95% CI 0·48-0·83, P-score 0·84) and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked second (0·66, 0·53-0·83, P-score 0·77). For failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, there were no significant differences between active treatments after direct or indirect comparisons. For failure to achieve improvement in abdominal pain at 4-12 weeks, tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy (0·53, 0·34-0·83, P-score 0·87); however, this result was based on data from only four RCTs involving 92 patients. For failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal pain, none of the active treatments showed superior efficacy upon indirect comparison. Tricyclic antidepressants were more likely than placebo to lead to adverse events (1·59, 1·26-2·06, P-score 0·16).
INTERPRETATION: In this network meta-analysis of RCTs of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators for IBS, few of which were judged as being at a low risk of bias, peppermint oil was ranked first for efficacy when global symptoms were used as the outcome measure, and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy when abdominal pain was used as the outcome measure. However, because of the lack of methodological rigour of some RCTs analysed in our study, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty around these findings. In addition, because treatment duration in most included trials was 4-12 weeks, the long-term relative efficacy of these treatments is unknown.

38754307,"The Efficacy And Real-World Effectiveness Of A Diet Low In Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD) has been shown to effectively reduce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Effects resulting from real-world studies may differ from those seen in efficacy studies because of the diversity of patients in real-world settings. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effect of the LFD on reducing IBS symptoms and improving the quality of life (QoL) in efficacy trials and real-world studies.
METHODS: Major databases, trial registries, dissertations, and journals were systematically searched for studies on the LFD in adults with IBS. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model with standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Outcomes of interest were all patient-reported: stool consistency, stool frequency, abdominal pain, overall symptoms, adequate symptom relief, IBS-specific QoL and adherence to the LFD.
RESULTS: Eleven efficacy and 19 real-world studies were reviewed. The meta-analysis results for abdominal pain (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.54) and QoL (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.50) showed the LFD was beneficial in efficacy studies with no statistically significant results for stool frequency (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.07). Real-world studies found improvements in abdominal pain and QoL. Due to heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was done for stool consistency and overall symptoms. In these outcomes, results were mostly supportive of the LFD, but they were not always statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest the LFD improves outcomes compared to a control diet (efficacy studies) or baseline data (real-world studies). Because of diverse study designs and heterogeneity of results, a clear superiority of the LFD over control diets could not be concluded. There are no indications of an efficacy-effectiveness gap for the LFD in adults with IBS.",Jent S; Bez NS; Haddad J; Catalano L; Egger KS; Raia M; Tedde GS; Rogler G,2024,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",43,6,1551-1562,10.1016/j.clnu.2024.05.014,"Jent, S., Bez, N.

38711328,Effects Of A Low Fodmap Diet On The Symptom Management Of Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Umbrella Review With The Meta-Analysis Of Clinical Trials.,"A low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a common restrictive diet to manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no consensus on the alleviating effects of this diet. Herein, a systematic umbrella review with meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of an LFD on IBS symptoms and its secondary outcomes in patients, which were not reported in previous meta-analyses. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to December 2023. The methodological quality of systematic reviews and their included trials was evaluated using AMSTAR 2 and the Cochrane risk of bias, respectively. The certainty of the evidence tool was evaluated using the GRADE approach. The data related to IBS symptoms, quality of life (QoL), microbiome diversity, and stool short-chain fatty acids were extracted. A random-effect (if RCTs ≥ 6) or fixed-effect model (if RCTs < 5) was used to recalculate effect sizes and 95% CIs and report them in both qualitative and quantitative terms (pooled risk ratio, Hedges' g, and weighted mean difference). A total of 658 articles were initially identified, with 11 meta-analyses and 24 RCTs reporting 28 outcomes with 1646 participants included. An LFD significantly affected the clinical improvement of total symptoms according to the IBS-SSS questionnaire (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.97; P = 0.04) in all the subtypes of IBS and also had favorable effects on stool consistency (WMD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.902, -0.07) and frequency (WMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.10) and some other GI symptoms in both less and more than 4 weeks of diet intervention except for stool consistency, which needed more than 4 weeks of LFD implementation. A significant QoL improvement was observed but not in the anxiety and depression state. Furthermore, some studies showed that an LFD may increase fecal pH and dysbiosis and reduce SCFA and the abundance of Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, an LFD can alleviate symptoms and QoL in IBS patients, although dysbiosis may occur. Considering the low certainty of evidence, strong RCTs with more appropriate designs are needed.",Khalighi Sikaroudi M; Soltani S; Ghoreishy SM; Ebrahimi Z; Shidfar F; Dehnad A,2024,Food & function,15,10,5195-5208,10.1039/d3fo03717g,"Khalighi Sikaroudi, M., Soltani, S., Ghoreishy, S.

37375612,Efficacy Of Different Dietary Patterns In The Treatment Of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders In Children And Adolescents: A Systematic Review Of Intervention Studies.,"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children and adolescents. In recent years, interest in the role of diet in the treatment of FGIDs has increased. Currently, interest focuses on the low-FODMAP diet (LFD), the fructose- or lactose-restricted diet (FRD or LRD), the gluten-free diet (GFD), and the Mediterranean diet (MD). In this review, we focus on the role of these dietary patterns in the FGIDs most commonly diagnosed in clinical practice, namely irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal pain (FAP), functional dyspepsia (FD), and functional constipation (FC). Fifteen clinical trials were systematically reviewed (both RCTs and single-arm clinical trials). We demonstrated the lack of high-quality intervention trials. Based on current evidence, low-FODMAP diet, LRD, FRD, and GFD have no place in daily clinical practice for the management of children and adolescents with FGIDs. Nevertheless, some patients with IBS or RAP may experience some benefit from the use of a low-FODMAP diet or FRD/LRD. Limited data suggest that MD may be promising in the management of FGIDs, especially in IBS patients, but more data are required to investigate the mechanisms of its protective effects.",Katsagoni CN; Karagianni VM; Papadopoulou A,2023,Nutrients,15,12,,10.3390/nu15122708,"Katsagoni, C.

40258374,Efficacy Of Dietary Interventions In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often interested in dietary interventions as a means of managing their symptoms. However, the relative efficacy of available diets for the management of IBS is unclear. We aimed to examine the relative efficacy of various dietary interventions in IBS.
METHODS: For this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to Feb 7, 2025, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing an active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food in IBS with either a control intervention, such as a habitual diet, sham diet, a high fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet, or alternative miscellaneous dietary advice, or any other active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food. We assessed efficacy using dichotomous assessments of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. We pooled data using a random-effects model, with the efficacy of each intervention reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. We ranked interventions according to their P-score, which measures the mean extent of certainty that one intervention is better than another, averaged over all competing interventions.
FINDINGS: We identified 28 eligible randomised controlled trials (comprising 2338 patients) of 11 different dietary interventions compared with four control interventions, of which six (low FODMAP diet, British Dietetic Association/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [BDA/NICE] diet, lactose-reduced diet, starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet, a personalised diet, and a Mediterranean diet) were studied in more than one trial. For global IBS symptoms, assessed in 28 randomised controlled trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked first (RR of global IBS symptoms not improving 0·41 [95% CI 0·26-0·67]; P-score 0·84; two trials), a low FODMAP diet ranked fourth (0·51 [0·37-0·70]; P-score 0·71; 24 trials), and a BDA/NICE diet ranked tenth (0·62 [0·43-0·90]; P-score 0·44; eight trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal pain, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised controlled trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked second (RR of abdominal pain not improving 0·54 [95% CI 0·33-0·90]; P-score 0·73; two trials), and a low FODMAP diet ranked fifth (0·61 [0·42-0·89]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal bloating or distension, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised trial, only a low FODMAP diet (RR of abdominal bloating or distension not improving 0·55 [95% CI 0·37-0·80]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials) was superior to a habitual diet and ranked fourth. For bowel habit, assessed in 23 randomised trials, none of the dietary interventions was superior to any of the control interventions, but a low FODMAP diet was superior to a BDA/NICE diet (RR of bowel habit not improving 0·79 [95% CI 0·63-0·99]). All comparisons across the network were rated as low or very low confidence, except for direct comparisons between a low FODMAP diet or a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet and habitual diet, both of which were rated as moderate confidence.
INTERPRETATION: In terms of dietary interventions for IBS, the most evidence exists for a low FODMAP diet, but other promising therapies are emerging and should be the subject of further study.

39835671,An Evidence-Based Update On The Diagnosis And Management Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction affecting 5% of the population. The cardinal symptoms are abdominal pain and altered stool form or frequency.
AREAS COVERED: Diagnosis and management of IBS. We searched the literature for diagnostic accuracy studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses. A positive diagnosis of IBS, alongside testing to exclude celiac disease, is recommended. Exhaustive investigation has a low yield. Patients should be offered traditional dietary advice. If response is incomplete, specialist dietetic guidance should be considered. Probiotics may be beneficial, but quality of evidence is poor. First-line treatment of constipation is with laxatives, with secretagogues used where these are ineffective. Anti-diarrheal drugs should be used first-line for diarrhea, with second-line drugs including 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists, eluxadoline, or rifaximin, where available. First-line treatment of abdominal pain should be with antispasmodics, with gut-brain neuromodulators prescribed second-line. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are preferred. Brain-gut behavioral therapies are effective and have evidence for efficacy in patients refractory to standard therapies.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite substantial advances, there remains scope for improvement in terms of both the diagnosis and management of IBS. Reinforcement of positive diagnostic strategies for the condition and novel treatment paradigms are required.",Black CJ; Ford AC,2025,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,,,1-16,10.1080/17474124.2025.2455586,"Black, C.

30996042,Efficacy Of Pharmacological Therapies In Patients With Ibs With Diarrhoea Or Mixed Stool Pattern: Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Over half of patients with IBS have either diarrhoea (IBS-D) or a mixed stool pattern (IBS-M). The relative efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies is unclear in the absence of head-to-head trials. We conducted a network meta-analysis to resolve this uncertainty.
DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov through January 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies (alosetron, eluxadoline, ramosetron and rifaximin) in adults with IBS-D or IBS-M. Trials included in the analysis reported a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, and data were pooled using a random effects model. Efficacy and safety of all pharmacological therapies were reported as a pooled relative risk with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their p score.
RESULTS: We identified 18 eligible RCTs (seven alosetron, five ramosetron, two rifaximin and four eluxadoline), containing 9844 patients. All were superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS-D or IBS-M at 12 weeks, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoint for trials in IBS. Alosetron 1 mg twice daily was ranked first for efficacy, based on the FDA-recommended composite endpoint of improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency, effect on global symptoms of IBS and effect on stool consistency. Ramosetron 2.5μg once daily was ranked first for effect on abdominal pain. Total numbers of adverse events were significantly greater with alosetron 1 mg twice daily and ramosetron 2.5μg once daily, compared with placebo. Rifaximin 550 mg three times daily ranked first for safety. Constipation was significantly more common with all drugs, except rifaximin 550 mg three times daily.
CONCLUSION: In a network meta-analysis of RCTs of pharmacological therapies for IBS-D and IBS-M, we found all drugs to be superior to placebo, but alosetron and ramosetron appeared to be the most effective.",Black CJ; Burr NE; Camilleri M; Earnest DL; Quigley EM; Moayyedi P; Houghton LA; Ford AC,2020,Gut,69,1,74-82,10.1136/gutjnl-2018-318160,"Black, C.

34110640,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Safety Of Vedolizumab During Pregnancy In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vedolizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, often affecting women of child-bearing age. We aimed to compare maternal and fetal adverse outcomes in pregnancies of women with inflammatory bowel disease exposed to vedolizumab versus those on other treatment.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search through December 2020 looking for studies including outcomes from pregnancies of female inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with vedolizumab. Our primary outcome was a composite of adverse pregnancy-related events in pregnancies of female patients on vedolizumab compared with those of disease-matched controls on other medication regimens. Events of interest included preterm births, early loss of pregnancy, late fetal death, elective termination of pregnancy, and congenital anomalies.
RESULTS: Four studies were included in our review meeting criteria for our primary analysis. Compared with those with no vedolizumab exposure, pregnancies with vedolizumab exposure had an increase in overall adverse pregnancy-related outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-3.13). The vedolizumab group also had increased preterm births (OR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.28-3.66), and early loss of pregnancies (OR 1.79, 95% CI, 1.06-3.01) but no difference in number of live births (OR 0.60, 95%CI, 0.36-1.00), or congenital malformations (OR 1.56, 95% CI, 0.56-4.37).
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review highlights possible concern with the general safety of vedolizumab in pregnancy, as an increase in overall total unfavorable outcomes was observed. Premature births and early loss of pregnancy were also more prevalent in pregnant female patients on vedolizumab. It is possible these findings are confounded by disease activity, and further prospective cohort studies of vedolizumab and pregnancy outcomes are warranted.",Bell C; Tandon P; Lentz E; Marshall JK; Narula N,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,10,2640-2648,10.1111/jgh.15574,"Bell, C., Tandon, P., Lentz, E., Marshall, J.

37937498,Risk Of Allergic Rhinitis In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous parallels exist between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and allergic rhinitis (AR), which include risk factors (such as environmental and genetic factors), pathogenesis (immune disorders, epithelial cell barriers, etc.), and treatment (immunosuppressants and immunomodulators, such as cyclosporine and steroids). However, the risk of AR in IBD patients is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, patients with IBD are examined for their risk of AR.
METHODS: Several databases are accessible in both Chinese and English, including PubMed, BioRXiv, WanFang, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, METSTR, and MedRxiv. Findings presented at allergy, rhinology, thoracic, and gastrointestinal conferences were analyzed. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two evaluators independently retrieved data, read the literature, and evaluated bias risk. The data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. Case-control and cohort studies were eligible study designs for this research.
RESULTS: There were 10 case-control studies and 1 cohort study included in the meta-analysis. The experimental group consisted of 65,687 IBD patients, of whom 5838 had AR. A total of 345,176 participants without IBD were included in the control group, of whom 24,625 developed AR. The outcomes demonstrated that IBD patients had a higher risk of developing AR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 1.95], Z = 2.78, P = 0.005) than those without IBD.
CONCLUSION: The risk of AR is higher in IBD patients.

34114657,Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis: Efficacy Of Licensed Drugs For Abdominal Bloating In Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Constipation.,"BACKGROUND: Although bloating is a highly prevalent and troublesome symptom in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), treatment is empirical with no specific guidelines for its management.
AIM: To conduct a pairwise and network meta-analysis, using a frequentist approach, of Food and Drug Administration-licensed drugs for IBS-C comparing their efficacy for abdominal bloating as a specific endpoint.
METHODS: We searched the medical literature through December 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in IBS-C, with abdominal bloating reported as a dichotomous assessment. Efficacy of each drug was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, containing 10 091 patients. Linaclotide 290 μg o.d., lubiprostone 8 μg b.d., tenapanor 50 mg b.d. and tegaserod 6 mg b.d. were all superior to placebo for abdominal bloating in patients with IBS-C, in both pairwise and the network meta-analyses. Linaclotide demonstrated the greatest improvement in abdominal bloating in both pairwise and network meta-analysis (RR of failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal bloating = 0.78; 95% CI 0.74-0.83, number needed to treat = 7, P-score 0.97). Indirect comparison revealed no significant differences between individual drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: We found all licensed drugs for IBS-C to be superior to placebo for abdominal bloating. Linaclotide appeared to be the most efficacious at relieving abdominal bloating. Further research is needed to assess long-term efficacy of these agents and to better understand the precise mechanism of improving bloating.",Nelson AD; Black CJ; Houghton LA; Lugo-Fagundo NS; Lacy BE; Ford AC,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,2,98-108,10.1111/apt.16437,"Nelson, A.

37565634,Probiotics For The Management Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Three-Level Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Previous systematic reviews demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, these studies are either affected by the inclusion of insufficient trials or by the problem of dependent data across multiple outcomes, and an overall effect size has not been provided. We aimed to determine the effect of probiotics on IBS through a three-level meta-analysis and clarify potential effect moderators.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, screening for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the effect of probiotics on IBS. The primary outcome was the improvement in the severity of global IBS symptoms at the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the improvement in abdominal pain and the quality of life. The effect sizes of the probiotics were measured by using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled by a three-level meta-analysis model.
RESULTS: We included 72 RCTs in the analysis. The meta-analysis showed significantly better overall effect of probiotics than placebo on the global IBS symptoms (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.34, P <0.001), abdominal pain (SMD -0.89, 95% CI -1.29 to -0.5, P <0.001) and quality of life (SMD 0.99, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.54, P <0.001), respectively. Moderator analysis found that a treatment duration shorter than 4 weeks was associated with a larger effect size in all the outcomes, and Bacillus probiotics had better improvement on the abdominal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics had a short-term effect and a medium effect size on the global IBS symptoms. Treatment duration and types of probiotics affected the effect size of probiotics, and shorter durations and Bacillus probiotics were associated with better treatment effects.

34469886,Dental Caries Occurrence In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The present review aimed to systematically evaluate the occurrence of caries in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), compared to healthy controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Google Scholar, LILACS, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were screened. Caries experience was measured through the Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval was calculated between IBD patients and healthy controls.
RESULTS: Six studies were selected for the inclusion in the systematic review, 5 of which were also included in the quantitative synthesis of data. The WMD in the DMFT index between IBD and healthy subjects was 3.04 (1.52, 4.56) (p = 0.10). Subgroup analysis showed no difference (p = 0.31) between CD (2.52 [0.54, 4.49]) and UC (4.01 [1.52, 4.56]) subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a remarkably higher past and present occurrence of dental caries in subjects with IBD than healthy controls. This result should encourage clinicians to include oral health preventive programs in the overall treatment plan of IBD patients.",Marruganti C; Discepoli N; Gaeta C; Franciosi G; Ferrari M; Grandini S,2021,Caries research,55,5,485-495,10.1159/000519170,"Marruganti, C., Discepoli, N., Gaeta, C., Franciosi, G., Ferrari, M., & Grandini, S.

36682029,Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis: The Impact Of Cancer Treatments On The Disease Activity Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between cancer treatments and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effects of cancer treatments on the disease activity of IBD.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature on cancer therapy in patients with pre-existing IBD. Electronic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase were combined with manual searches (September 2021). Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. The primary outcome was flares of IBD following cancer therapy. Secondary outcomes were need for IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and initiation or intensification of steroid or biological treatments to manage IBD flares.
RESULTS: In total, 33 studies were included in the systematic review, comprising 1298 patients with IBD who received cancer treatment. The overall occurrence of IBD flares following cancer treatment was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23-37%). IBD flares resulted in utilization of systemic steroids and biologic therapies among 25% and 10% of patients, respectively, and in discontinuation of cancer treatment among 14% of patients. Finally, the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity following immune check point inhibitor treatment [ICI] was increased in patients with IBD compared to patients without IBD (RR = 3.62 [95% CI 2.57-5.09]). Despite this, the studies generally reported that flares were manageable.
CONCLUSIONS: Current data indicate a high proportion of patients with IBD experiencing a flare following the start of cancer treatment. Patients with IBD were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity following ICI treatment compared to those without IBD. However, cancer therapy-induced IBD flares were manageable and should not preclude appropriate cancer treatments.",Grimsdottir S; Attauabi M; Kristine Dahl E; Burisch J; Seidelin JB,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,7,1139-1153,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad010,"Grimsdottir, S., Attauabi, M., Kristine Dahl, E., Burisch, J., & Seidelin, J.

34849941,Safety Of Immunizations For The Adult Patient With Inflammatory Bowel Disease-A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have low vaccination rates for vaccine-preventable diseases. Fear of adverse reactions (AEs) appear to negatively affect vaccination efforts. We aimed to systemically review the risks for AEs following immunization for patients with IBD.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase until April 15, 2020, for studies evaluating the safety of vaccinations among patients with IBD. The primary outcome was the incidence of systemic and local AEs among vaccinated patients. Secondary outcome was the rate of IBD flare following immunization. We utilized a random effects meta-analysis of proportions using the DerSimonian-Laird approach to estimate the safety of immunizations.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies with 2116 patients was included in our analysis after fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Seven studies examined the influenza vaccine, 4 the pneumococcal vaccine, 1 the recombinant zoster vaccine, and 1 the hepatitis B vaccine. Follow-up of patients was up to 6 months. The majority of AEs were local, with a pooled incidence of 24% (95% CI, 9%-42%) for all vaccines. Systemic AEs were mostly mild, without resulting in hospitalizations or deaths, with a pooled incidence of 16% (95% CI, 6%-29%) for all vaccines. Flare of inflammatory bowel disease after vaccination found with a pooled incidence of 2% (95% CI, 1%-4%) and we include in the analysis data from all immunizations examined.
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that AEs after vaccination are mainly local or mildly systemic and do not differ significantly from the expected AE after recommended immunizations for the general population. Thus, gastroenterologists should reinforce that vaccines are safe in patients with IBD.",Desalermos A; Pimienta M; Kalligeros M; Shehadeh F; Diamantopoulos L; Karamanolis G; Caldera F; Farraye FA,2022,Inflammatory bowel diseases,28,9,1430-1442,10.1093/ibd/izab266,"Desalermos, A., Pimienta, M., Kalligeros, M., Shehadeh, F., Diamantopoulos, L., Karamanolis, G., Caldera, F., & Farraye, F.

32385487,Vitamin D Therapy In Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Emerging literature suggests that optimization of vitamin D levels may be associated with improvements in disease activity and quality of life. We conducted a meta-analysis exploring the effect of vitamin D on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25[OH]D) levels, clinical improvement, and biomarkers.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and sources for grey literature were searched from inception until September 2019. The primary outcome was s-25(OH)D mean differences. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ 2 test and the I2 statistic. Review Manager software v. 5.3 was used.
RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials (n = 611) and 4 observational studies (n = 359) were included in the meta-analysis. On average, in the randomized controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation increased s-25(OH)D levels by 15.50 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.08-19.92, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 90%) and in observational studies they increased by 18.39 ng/mL (95% CI, 8.91-27.88, P = 0.0001, I2 = 82%). Subgroup analyses between vitamin D and placebo groups revealed that vitamin D increased s-25(OH)D by 14.85 ng/mL (95% CI, 9.96-19.73, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 90%) and when high doses of vitamin D were compared with low doses, high doses increased s-25(OH)D by 18.27 ng/mL (95% CI, 5.44-31.10, P = 0.005, I2 = 90%). The Harvey Bradshaw Index improved by -1.47 points (95% CI, -2.47 to -0.47, P = 0.004, I2 = 0%) and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased by -1.58 mg/L (95% CI, -2.95 to -0.21, P = 0.02, I2 = 0%).

36649166,Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis: Stress-Management Interventions For Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder of unknown pathological origin that is associated with psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We investigated the effects of stress-management for adults with IBS on typical symptoms, HRQoL and mental health. With predefined criteria (patients: adults with IBS; intervention: stress-management; control: care as usual or waitlist; outcome: patient-relevant; study-type: controlled trials), we registered the study with PROSPERO (168030) and searched the main medical databases. Two researchers independently reviewed the publications and assessed the risk of bias using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist. We performed meta-analysis with homogeneous trials of acceptable quality. After screening 6656 publications, ten suitable randomized trials of acceptable (n = 5) or low methodological quality (n = 5) involving 587 patients were identified. Our meta-analysis showed no effect of stress-management on IBS severity 1-2 months after the intervention (Hedges' g = -0.23, 95%-CI = -0.84 to -0.38, I2 = 86.1%), and after 3-12 months (Hedges' g = -0.77, 95%-CI = -1.77 to -0.23, I2 = 93.3%). One trial found a short-term reduction of symptoms, and one trial found symptom relief in the long-term (at 6 months). One of two studies that examined HRQoL found an improvement (after 2 months). One of two studies that examined depression and anxiety found a reduction of these symptoms (after 3 weeks). Stress-management may be beneficial for patients with IBS regarding the short-term reduction of bowel and mental health symptoms, whereas long-term benefits are unclear. Good quality RCTs with more than 6 months follow-up are needed.",Horn A; Stangl S; Parisi S; Bauer N; Roll J; Löffler C; Gágyor I; Haas K; Heuschmann PU; Langhorst J; Keil T,2023,Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress,39,4,694-707,10.1002/smi.3226,"Horn, A., Stangl, S., Parisi, S., Bauer, N., Roll, J., Löffler, C., Gágyor, I., Haas, K., Heuschmann, P.

39129703,Mindfulness-Based Interventions On Psychological Comorbidities In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, lifelong disease, so IBD patients are highly susceptible to negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression, resulting in a reduced quality of life. Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) is widely used to reduce stress, anxiety and depression in people. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review of mindfulness-based intervention training on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with IBD through meta-analysis.
METHODS: Search papers in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang, and Embase databases. The search time limit was from the establishment of the database to May 2023. Randomized controlled trial studies of the effect of mindfulness intervention training on patients with IBD were screened, the included results were integrated and analyzed, and ReviewManager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with a total of 1030 IBD patients were included. A total of 10 studies showed that the anxiety of patients in the mindfulness intervention group was significantly reduced by (standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.01 to -0.45) compared to the control group. 8 studies showed that the intervention group significantly reduced patients' depression (SMD = -0.60, 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.42). 7 studies showed that the patient's quality of life improved after mindfulness intervention (SMD = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.87).
CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based intervention training can improve anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in the short term, but the long-term effects need to be confirmed by more randomized controlled trials.",Qian X; Zhang J,2024,Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,52,4,571-582,10.62641/aep.v52i4.1559,"Qian, X., & Zhang, J.

37024741,Interventions Increase Vaccination Rates In Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with immune-mediated conditions such as IBD and RA are at risk for vaccine-preventable infections. Despite guideline recommendations, prior studies have shown suboptimal vaccination rates.
AIM: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the different interventions intended to increase vaccination rates.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library up to 2020 for studies with interventions intended to increase vaccination rates. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to generate pooled odds ratios (ORs) to assess all interventions against no interventions. Our primary outcome was pneumococcal vaccination (PCV) rate.
RESULTS: Our review found 8580 articles, for which 15 IBD and 8 RA articles met the inclusion criteria; 21 articles were included in the analysis. PCV was the predominant vaccination (91%). In our analysis of patients with IBD, almost all interventions (patient-oriented, physician-oriented, or barrier-oriented) increased PCV uptake [OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 2.44-6.56, I2 = 90%] compared to no intervention. The greatest effect was seen in barrier-oriented studies [OR, 12.68; 95% CI, 2.21-72.62, I2 = 92%]. For RA data, all interventions had increased PCV uptake compared to no interventions (OR 2.74; 95% CI, 1.80-4.17, I2 = 95%).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that many different interventions can increase PCV rates. It appears that barrier-oriented interventions may have the greatest positive effect on increasing PCV uptake. However, clinicians should be encouraged to implement measures best suited to their practice. Future high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the best approach to optimize vaccination rates.",Patel J; Noureldin M; Fakhouri D; Farraye FA; Kovar-Gough I; Warren B; Waljee AK; Piper MS,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,7,2921-2935,10.1007/s10620-023-07903-7,"Patel, J., Noureldin, M., Fakhouri, D., Farraye, F.

32877572,Safety Of Bariatric Surgery In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The efficacy of bariatric surgery in achieving weight loss and preventing long-term comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis is well established. Data regarding safety of bariatric surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is scarce. We attempted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the complications following bariatric surgery in patients with IBD. The primary outcomes evaluated were wound infection, Clavien-Dindo grade > II complications and IBD exacerbation (within 1 year). Secondary outcomes evaluated included overall mortality, stricture, small bowel obstruction, acute kidney injury (AKI) and thromboembolism. Pooled outcomes (event rate) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects model. A total of 14 studies (all observational) with 2608 patients were included. The rates of primary outcomes were: wound infection (4.1%, 95% CI: 0.9-7.2), Clavien-Dindo grade > II complications (2.0%, 95%: CI 0.6-3.5) and IBD exacerbation (4.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-7.9). The pooled rate for other outcomes was: mortality 0.1%, stricture 6.5%, small bowel obstruction 6.7%, AKI 2.2% and thromboembolism 0.1%.

37489108,Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio And Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio In Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Disease Activity: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to examine if the platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio can be useful in determining disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to 9 January 2023. Platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values from active and remission inflammatory bowel disease cases were compared to generate a mean difference (MD).
RESULTS: Nine studies were included. Meta-analysis showed that inflammatory bowel disease patients with active disease had significantly higher values of platelet-lymphocyte ratio as compared to those in remission (MD: 63.46 95% CI: 35.74, 91.17, I2 = 89%). The values of platelet-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in both active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Meta-analysis also showed that lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values were significantly lower in active inflammatory bowel disease patients as compared to those under remission (MD: -1.28 95% CI: -1.42, -1.14, I2 = 4%). Lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values were significantly lower in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients with active disease.
CONCLUSION: Platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio can be useful blood-based markers in differentiating active disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Active cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have high platelet-lymphocyte ratio and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio as compared to those in remission.

35920906,Colorectal Cancer Risk Of Flat Low-Grade Dysplasia In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Proportion Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To date, the optimal management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and flat low-grade dysplasia (fLGD) of the colon or rectum remains controversial.
METHODS: A systematic review was reported in accordance with PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Patients diagnosed with fLGD on surveillance endoscopy were pooled from studies published between 2000 and 2020. Advanced neoplasia was defined by the presence of HGD, CRC or small bowel adenocarcinoma detected on subsequent surveillance endoscopy or from examination of resection specimens. We estimated the pooled annual incidence rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced neoplasia, and the risk factors associated with neoplastic progression.
RESULTS: We identified 24 articles and 738 IBD patients were diagnosed with fLGD on endoscopy. Two hundred thirty-six patients (32%) underwent immediate surgery with surgical specimens demonstrating CRC in 8 patients (pooled prevalence, 8.66%; 95% CI 3.58-19.46) and HGD (high grade dysplasia) in 11 patients (pooled prevalence, 13.97%; 95% CI 5.65-30.65). Five hundred-two patients (68%) underwent endoscopic surveillance with 63 patients with fLGD progressing to advanced neoplasia during endoscopic surveillance (38 HGD, 24 CRC and one patient developing small bowel adenocarcinoma). The mean duration of follow-up after fLGD diagnosis was 71 months (10.9-212). The pooled incidence of CRC and advanced neoplasia was 0.5 (95% CI 0.23-0.77) and 1.71 per 100 patient-year (95% CI 0.88-2.54) respectively. The use of corticosteroids and location of fLGD in the distal colon were significantly associated with neoplastic progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a summary incidence rate of CRC and advanced neoplasia in patients with IBD and fLGD to inform surgeons' and endoscopists' decision-making thus reducing potential ineffective treatments.",Lauricella S; Fabris S; Sylla P,2023,Surgical endoscopy,37,1,48-61,10.1007/s00464-022-09462-w,"Lauricella, S., Fabris, S., & Sylla, P.

34405817,Risk Factors For Vitamin D Deficiency In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To identify risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in inflammatory bowel disease and conduct a comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis to quantify the impact on vitamin D deficiency.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search of studies through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. In addition, relevant articles were searched manually. Studies were included if the odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI of each risk factor were reported or could be calculated. We will use the fixed-effects or random-effects model to estimate the pooled effect.
RESULTS: Out of 1018 articles, 25 eligible studies were identified, including 5826 participants. The risk factors associated with hypovitaminosis D were non-Caucasian (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.68-5.34), Crohn's disease (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.21-1.56), disease activity (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.61-2.13), inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.38-1.89), exposure to steroid (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28-2.03), and biologics (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.48-2.14). In 30 ng/mL and adjusted OR subgroup, male (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.47-2.31) and winter season (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.69-3.67) also were risk factors, respectively. 5-aminosalicylic acid (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.74-1.63) and smoking (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.98-1.45) were unrelated to vitamin D deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: For vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease, non-Caucasian, Crohn's disease, disease activity, surgery, exposure to steroid and biologics, males are risk factors, while 5-aminosalicylic acid and smoking are not. The relationship between body mass index, winter season, exposure to immunomodulators, and vitamin D deficiency remains unclear.",Shi S; Feng J; Zhou L; Li Y; Shi H,2021,The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,32,6,508-518,10.5152/tjg.2021.20614,"Shi, S., Feng, J., Zhou, L., Li, Y., & Shi, H.

This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence on the effect of genotype-based dosing of thiopurines on treatment efficacy and safety in inflammatory bowel disease (objective #1), and the association between genotype status and the efficacy and safety profile (objective #2).
METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched in August 2021. A total of 80 studies (19,859 individuals) were included. Meta-analyses for mortality, different types of adverse events (AEs), withdrawal due to AE, change in disease activity and clinical remission were performed following mainly a fixed-effects model. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020148130.
RESULTS: Genotype-based dosing was associated to a significantly lower incidence of hematologic AEs (risk ratio=0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.90; I2 : 47%; 4 randomized controlled trials; moderate quality), which may be attributable to nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) testing more than to thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping. No differences were found in other outcomes. Mutations in TPMT and NUDT15 genes were associated to a higher probability of serious AEs [odds ratio (OR) TPMT=4.98; OR NUDT15=11.44], hematologic AEs (OR TPMT=3.18), and serious hematologic AEs (OR TPMT=7.88; OR NUDT15=12.83). TPMT was also associated with a higher risk of withdrawals due to AEs (OR=3.38), and NUDT15 with gastrointestinal AEs (OR=2.04). Mutations in the ITPA gene did not lead to significant differences. Evidence of an association between other genes and clinical outcomes is still scarce.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in TPMT and NUDT15 genes predispose patients to suffer thiopurine-induced toxicity, and genotype-guided treatment has been shown to contribute to the prevention of thiopurine-induced toxicity, especially in the case of NUDT15 in Asians.",Gutiérrez-Valencia M; Leache L; Saiz LC; Beloqui JJ; Barajas M; Vicuña M; Erviti J,2023,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,57,7,671-685,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001791,"Gutiérrez-Valencia, M., Leache, L., Saiz, L.

36997007,Assessment Of Anti-Inflammatory Efficacy Of Acupuncture In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation has a significant role in the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Increasing attention has been paid to the use of acupuncture in IBD patients; however, its regulatory effects on inflammatory factors in IBD still require validation. Here, we systematically evaluated the effects of acupuncture on inflammatory factors in IBD patients.
METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria. After evaluating the quality of the studies selected by two reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in IBD patients and the impact on inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-8 and IL-10).
RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials with a total of 228 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on IBD (MD = 1.22, 95% CI [1.07, 1.39], P = 0.003). Moreover, it regulates the levels of TNF-α (MD =-60.58, 95% CI [-100.30, -20.89], P = 0.003), IL-8 (MD =-56.40, 95% CI [-60.02, -52.14], P < 0.00001) and IL-10 (MD =35.96, 95% CI [11.02, 60.91], P = 0.005) in IBD patients. However, the P value of meta-analysis in IL-1 great than 0.05.(MD =-27.90, 95% CI [-97.82, 42.02], P = 0.11).
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on IBD and can effectively regulate inflammatory factors in IBD patients. TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-10 are more appropriate inflammatory indicators for clinically evaluating the anti-inflammatory response in the blood of IBD patients by acupuncture.",Yang X; He M; Tang Q; Wang Z; Jin D; Wu X; Yang Y; Ma D; Sun M; Li T,2023,Complementary therapies in medicine,74,,102946,10.1016/j.ctim.2023.102946,"Yang, X., He, M., Tang, Q., Wang, Z., Jin, D., Wu, X., Yang, Y., Ma, D., Sun, M., & Li, T.

32578179,Safety And Efficacy Of Bariatric Surgery In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis studying safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in IBD patients as well as the impact of bariatric surgery on IBD course.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases (through September 2019) to identify studies that reported outcome of bariatric surgery in IBD patients. Outcomes assessed included the pooled rate of adverse events, change in medications after bariatric surgery, and 12-month excess weight loss (EWL) and body mass index (BMI) reduction after bariatric surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included in final analysis. The pooled rate of early and late adverse events was 15.9% (95% CI, 9.3-25.9) and 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-23.1), respectively. The rate of adverse events in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was 45.6% (95% CI, 21.9-71.4) compared with 21.6% (95% CI, 11.1-38) in sleeve gastrectomy (p = 0.11). The pooled rate of 12-month EWL and BMI reduction after surgery was 66.1% (95% CI, 59.8-72.3%) and 13.7 kg/m2 (95% CI, 12.5-14.9), respectively. The pooled rate of decrease, increase, and no change of IBD medications were 45.6% (95% CI, 23.8-69.2), 11% (95% CI, 6.3-18.4), and 57.6% (95% CI, 39.2-74.1), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery has acceptable safety and efficacy profile in IBD patients. Nearly half of patients had decrease in their IBD medications after bariatric surgery, and only 10% experienced therapeutic escalation following bariatric surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy may be the preferred procedure in this population.",Garg R; Mohan BP; Ponnada S; Singh A; Aminian A; Regueiro M; Click B,2020,Obesity surgery,30,10,3872-3883,10.1007/s11695-020-04729-4,"Garg, R., Mohan, B.

33346998,Alterations In Heart Rate Variability Associated With Irritable Bowel Syndrome Or Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are gastrointestinal pathologies affecting large numbers of the global population and incurring significant healthcare costs. Disruptions in the gut-brain axis occurring in these conditions can lead to increased inflammation, affecting gastrointestinal and autonomic nervous system function. Heart rate variability (HRV) is commonly used to assess the state of the sympathetic and parasympathetic function of the autonomic nervous system, but it remains unclear how HRV measures are associated with gastrointestinal pathologies. Here, we conduct a systematic review of the literature comparing HRV of subjects diagnosed with IBS or IBD to HRV in healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL (EBSCO) for eligible studies up to 2018. We included any study comparing a recognized measure of HRV between a group of patients with either IBS or IBD to a group of matched HC before any intervention. Studies were screened, and data were extracted from included articles using predefined criteria. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for each outcome, with effect size reported as the standardized mean difference.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between IBD and HC in time domain HRV and significant decreases in high-frequency power measures were also noted, in both IBS and IBD compared with HC.
DISCUSSION: Parasympathetic nervous system activity, represented through high-frequency power, seems to be lower in people with IBS and IBD, but conclusions are limited by the small number of studies that provide usable data, methodological heterogeneity, and high risks of bias in primary study methods and measures.",Sadowski A; Dunlap C; Lacombe A; Hanes D,2020,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,12,1,e00275,10.14309/ctg.0000000000000275,"Sadowski, A., Dunlap, C., Lacombe, A., & Hanes, D.

36579768,Effectiveness Of Vitamin D Supplementation On Disease Course In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The vitamin D role in bone metabolism is well known; however, recent evidence suggests the impact of vitamin D in immune modulation and its implications in immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHOD: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis by a specific protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42022311184; March 2022, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=311184). Randomized clinical trials involving IBD patients treated with vitamin D supplementation, compared with placebo, that evaluated the risk of clinical relapse and disease activity were included. Literature search was performed using Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL through January 2022.
RESULTS: Out of 1448 articles, 12 (11 full-texts and 1 abstract) were included. Seven randomized clinical trials reported data on the clinical relapse as dichotomous outcome, while 7 studies reported data on disease activity expressed as continuous variables. The pooled risk ratio of clinical relapse was 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.89; I2 = 25%) among 458 IBD patients. However, this seems to be solid only in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In fact, only 2 studies, involving 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, were included in the analysis. CD patients in clinical remission had a strong significant risk reduction in clinical relapse (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.82; I2 = 0%), suggesting that it could be a specific subgroup with maximum clinical benefit of vitamin D supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of clinical relapse in IBD patients, especially in CD patients in clinical remission. In a subgroup analysis, it was not significant (due to small number of studies and low number of patients), and well-powered studies are needed, in particular for ulcerative colitis patients.",Valvano M; Magistroni M; Cesaro N; Carlino G; Monaco S; Fabiani S; Vinci A; Vernia F; Viscido A; Latella G,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,2,281-291,10.1093/ibd/izac253,"Valvano, M., Magistroni, M., Cesaro, N., Carlino, G., Monaco, S., Fabiani, S., Vinci, A., Vernia, F., Viscido, A., & Latella, G.

35396764,Vitamin D Supplementation For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and complex gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Observational studies have suggested a relationship between serum vitamin D levels and IBS symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation on IBS symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) measures.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by four authors independently, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus from the senior author. Continuous data were pooled with standardized mean difference (SMD) using the DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis by risk of bias and potentially ""predatory"" publication were performed as well.
RESULTS: A total of 685 patients across eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation significantly improved IBS symptom severity scale scores, with a SMD of -0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.47 to -0.07, P = 0.04, I2 = 91%). Improvements in IBS-QoL scores were also observed, albeit not statistically significant (SMD 0.54; 95% CI -0.34 to 1.41, P = 0.15, I2 = 87%). However, small sample sizes, a relatively young study population, limited ethnicities, and varied vitamin D dosing strategies across the studies were notable limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation could be part of our clinical armamentarium when managing IBS patients due to the potential efficacy and good safety profile. Further randomized, controlled trials are required to confirm the therapeutic effects.",Chong RIH; Yaow CYL; Loh CYL; Teoh SE; Masuda Y; Ng WK; Lim YL; Ng QX,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,6,993-1003,10.1111/jgh.15852,"Chong, R.

40000943,Risk Of Stroke In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Current studies suggest a potential link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke. This study aimed to assess the risk of stroke in IBD patients compared to general population.
METHODS: Systematic search was done in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and CINAHL databases for studies published till September 2023. Using a random-effects model, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stroke occurrence were calculated. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate pooled HR with 95%CI for CD, UC, and overall IBD cases separately. Publication bias assessment was done by Begg's and Egger's tests.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 2,802,955 participants were included. IBD patients in general had significantly higher risk of stroke, with HR of 1.30 [95% CI 1.21-1.39]. Subgroup analysis demonstrated an HR of 1.35 [95% CI 1.22-1.49] for CD and 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.22] for UC. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across studies, with no substantial publication bias. Sensitivity analyses affirmed the stability of findings.
CONCLUSION: IBD in general, and Crohn's disease in particular are associated with significantly higher risk of stroke. Our findings further emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and management strategies in IBD care.

38589784,Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-Α Therapy May Not Be Safe During Pregnancy In Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Updated Meta-Analysis And Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects reproductive-aged women. Active disease can lead to decreased fertility. Although the vast majority of international guidelines recommend for the continuation of anti-TNF-α during pregnancy, recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) therapy during pregnancy, both for patients and for physicians.
METHODS: Studies that evaluate the safety of anti-TNF-α therapy in pregnant women with IBD were identified using bibliographical searches. An updated meta-analysis was performed for pregnancy outcomes, such as live birth, abortion, still birth, preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, and neonatal infection. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported. Data on disease activity, timing of anti-TNF-α therapy were collected for further analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 11 studies were screened from on-line databases and international meeting abstracts. An increased risk of abortion (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.74; P = 0.04) and preterm birth (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28; P = 0.004), and a decreased risk of live birth (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94; P = 0.002]) were found in the anti-TNF-α therapy group compared with the control group (no use of anti-TNF-α therapy). The subgroup analyses based on the disease activity showed there is no significant association between the use of anti-TNF-α therapy during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes of abortion, preterm birth, and live birth. The rates of still birth, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities in the anti-TNF-α therapy group were not significantly different from those in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-α therapy does not increase the risks of still birth, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities; however it may be assicated with increased risks of abortion and preterm birth, which are accompanied by a lower rate of live birth. Although these findings may be confounding by potential disease activity, they offer some opposite viewpoints with biologic agent use. Therefore, more studies are required to further confirm the safety of anti-TNF-α therapy in pregnancy with IBD.",Huang W; Zhang X; Zhang L; Dai X; Chen H; Xie Q,2024,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,24,1,251,10.1186/s12884-024-06443-w,"Huang, W., Zhang, X., Zhang, L., Dai, X., Chen, H., & Xie, Q.

34872306,Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In The Induction And Maintenance Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Remission: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to their special conditioning effects on the intestinal flora, but their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission is still controversial. In the present study, we analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of probiotics in IBD to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission of IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, and Weipu databases were searched for RCTs on the treatment of probiotics in IBD induction and/or maintenance of remission. Two researchers independently extracted literature data and cross-checked the extracted data. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool and the Jadad score were used to evaluate the quality of the literature. RevMan 5.20 software was used for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of ten RCTs were included, which included 777 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the clinical recurrence rate of probiotics in the CD remission phase and the control group [relative risk (RR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.06, P=0.12]. The clinical recurrence rate of UC in remission phase, the efficacy of probiotics compared with control group were not significantly different (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.80-1.42, P=0.65). The induction remission rate of UC during the active phase, the efficacy of probiotics is better than that of the control group (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09-1.98, P=0.01).

33299403,Acupuncture For Adults With Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome Or Functional Diarrhea: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Objective. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) or functional diarrhea (FD) in adults. Method. Five electronic databases-PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang-were searched, respectively, until June 8, 2020. The literature of clinical randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for the treatment of IBS-D or FD in adults were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted by Using Stata 16.0 software, the quality of the included studies was assessed by the RevMan ROB summary and graph, and the results were graded by GRADE. Result. Thirty-one studies with 3234 patients were included. Most of the studies were evaluated as low risk of bias related to selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. Nevertheless, seven studies showed the high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data. GRADE's assessments were either moderate certainty or low certainty. Compared with loperamide, acupuncture showed more effectiveness in weekly defecation (SMD = -0.29, 95% CI [-0.49, -0.08]), but no significant improvement in the result of the Bristol stool form (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.68, 0.12]). In terms of the drop-off rate, although the acupuncture group was higher than the bacillus licheniformis plus beanxit group (RR = 2.57, 95% CI [0.24, 27.65]), loperamide group (RR = 1.11, 95% CI [0.57, 2.15]), and trimebutine maleate group (RR = 1.19, 95% CI [0.31, 4.53]), respectively, it was lower than the dicetel group (RR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.56, 1.23]) and affected the overall trend (RR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.67, 1.29]). Besides, acupuncture produced more significant effect than dicetel related to the total symptom score (SMD = -1.17, 95% CI [-1.42, -0.93]), IBS quality of life (SMD = 2.37, 95% CI [1.94, 2.80]), recurrence rate (RR = 0.43, 95% CI [0.28, 0.66]), and IBS Symptom Severity Scale (SMD = -0.75, 95% CI [-1.04, -0.47]). Compared to dicetel (RR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.18, 1.32]) and trimebutine maleate (RR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.13, 1.61]), acupuncture also showed more effective at total efficiency. The more adverse effect occurred in the acupuncture group when comparing with the dicetel group (RR = 11.86, 95% CI [1.58, 89.07]) and loperamide group (RR = 4.42, 95% CI [0.57, 33.97]), but most of the adverse reactions were mild hypodermic hemorrhage.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the proportion of patients randomized to placebo or active drug experiencing any adverse event in trials of licensed drugs for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) or diarrhea (IBS-D), and to estimate the risk of developing adverse events among patients randomized to placebo.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC and EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (through June 2021) to identify RCTs comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adults with IBS-C or IBS-D. We generated Forest plots of pooled adverse event rates in both active drug and placebo arms and pooled risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
KEY RESULTS: There were 21 RCTs of licensed drugs versus placebo in IBS-C (5953 patients placebo) and 17 in IBS-D (3854 patients placebo). Overall, 34.9% and 46.9% of placebo patients in IBS-C and IBS-D trials, respectively, developed at least one adverse event, with a statistically significantly higher risk of any adverse event and withdrawal due to an adverse event with active drug. In IBS-C and IBS-D trials, rates of each individual adverse event were generally higher with active drug. However, in IBS-C trials, only diarrhea or headache was significantly more common with active drug (RD 0.066 (95% CI 0.043-0.088) and RD 0.011 (95% CI 0.002-0.021), respectively), and in IBS-D trials only constipation, nausea, or abdominal pain (RD 0.096 (95% CI 0.054-0.138), 0.014 (95% CI 0.002-0.027), and 0.018 (95% CI 0.002-0.034), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Patients with IBS randomized to placebo have a high risk of reporting adverse events, which might relate to both nocebo and non-nocebo factors. Although patients' expectations and psychosocial factors may be involved, further understanding of the mechanisms are important to control or optimize these effects in RCTs, as well as in clinical practice.",Barberio B; Savarino EV; Black CJ; Ford AC,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,6,e14279,10.1111/nmo.14279,"Barberio, B., Savarino, E.

32801010,The Risk Of Extraintestinal Cancer In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Population-Based Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of developing intestinal cancer. However, less is known about the risk of extraintestinal cancers (EICs). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohorts assessing the risk of EICs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
METHODS: Only population-based studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence of EICs were included. In total, 884 studies were screened and those included were assessed for quality. Eligible studies were pooled for length of follow-up evaluation, events in the IBD population, and events or expected events in a control population for the meta-analyses.
RESULTS: In total, 40 studies were included in the systematic review and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall risk of EICs was found to be increased in both CD (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.43 [CI, 1.26, 1.63]) and UC (IRR: 1.15 [1.02, 1.31]) patients. Both CD and UC patients presented with an increased risk of skin (IRR: CD, 2.22 [1.41-3.48]; UC, 1.38 [1.12-1.71]) and hepatobiliary (IRR: CD, 2.31 [1.25-4.28]; UC, 2.05 [1.52-2.76]) malignancies. Furthermore, CD patients showed an increased risk of hematologic (IRR, 2.40 [1.81-3.18]) and lung (IRR, 1.53 [1.23-1.91]) cancers. These increased risks were present despite treatment with immunosuppressives.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that both CD and UC patients are at an increased risk of developing EICs, both overall and at specific sites. However, additional studies with longer follow-up evaluation are needed to assess the true risk of EICs posed by IBD.",Lo B; Zhao M; Vind I; Burisch J,2021,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,19,6,1117-1138.e19,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.08.015,"Lo, B., Zhao, M., Vind, I., & Burisch, J.

38199885,Acupuncture And Moxibustion For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Umbrella Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS. Many systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS have been published in recent years, but their results are not entirely consistent.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the methodological, reporting, and evidence quality of systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS published before February 20, 2023 were searched in eight databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and China Biology Medicine. The keywords used for literature search were acupuncture, moxibustion, systematic review, meta-analysis, and irritable bowel syndrome.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Relevant information was independently extracted by two investigators. The A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020), and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) were used to evaluate the methodological quality, reporting quality and evidence quality, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 342 studies were retrieved and 15 systematic reviews were included. The results of AMSTAR 2 showed low methodological quality in 2 studies and very low methodological quality in the remaining 13 studies, with main issues being failure to register a protocol, incomplete search strategy, not providing a list of excluded studies, incomplete consideration of the risk of bias in the included studies, and a failure to assess the publication bias. The results of PRISMA 2020 showed seriously deficient reporting quality of 2 studies, somewhat deficient reporting quality of 12 studies, and relatively complete reporting quality of 1 study, with the main problems being lack of a complete search strategy, non-availability of a list of excluded studies with justification for their exclusion, not conducting heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses, not evaluating the credibility of the evidence, and not registering the protocol. The results of GRADE showed that the quality of the evidence is low or very low.
CONCLUSION: Most included systematic reviews interpreted findings to suggest that acupuncture and moxibustion have benefits for IBS. However, there is a need to improve the methodological, reporting and evidence quality of the systematic reviews. Larger, multicenter, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials and high-quality systematic reviews are required to obtain more robust evidence.

36182873,"The Incidence, Clinical Characteristics And Serological Characteristics Of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-Induced Lupus In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: There are concerns regarding anti-TNF-induced lupus (ATIL) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis about the incidence, the clinical characteristics and serological characteristics of ATIL secondary to anti-TNF agents in IBD patients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Primary outcomes were the pooled ATIL incidence rates in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. Secondary outcomes were the pooled clinical symptoms incidence rates, autoantibodies incidence rates and clinical resolution rates in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 2.5%. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in UC and CD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The pooled ATIL incidence rate in IBD patients treated with IFX and ADA was 4.5% and 0.2%, respectively. The pooled arthritis, mucocutaneous symptom, myalgia and fatigue incidence rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 87.2%, 29.4%, 23.9% and 41.8%, respectively. The pooled ANA rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 97.3%. The pooled anti-dsDNA antibody rate in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents was 73.9%.
CONCLUSION: ATIL has a low prevalence in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. ATIL occurs more frequently in CD patients than in UC patients. Arthritis, fatigue and mucocutaneous lesions were found to be common symptoms of ATIL. Patients with ATIL were more likely to develop ANA and anti-dsDNA.",Dai C; Wang YN; Tian WN; Huang YH; Jiang M,2022,International immunopharmacology,112,,109269,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109269,"Dai, C., Wang, Y.

34752585,Coping Strategies And Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities. While psychosocial determinants were intently studied, coping strategies with stress used by IBS patients were never comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize the coping strategies used by IBS patients and to identify which tools are frequently used to measure coping strategies.
METHODS: According to PRISMA guidelines, we searched for articles indexed in PubMed, EBSCOhost, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. The search terms included: (coping OR coping strategies OR coping mechanism) AND (irritable bowel syndrome OR IBS). The initial search identified 756 articles. After applying all filters (human filters, excluding conference abstracts and conference papers), 96 studies remained. Finally, a total of 21 articles were included in this systematic review.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles using fifteen coping instruments and six measures of quality of life were found. One was interventional, one longitudinal, and the rest were cross-sectional studies. One study was qualitative, while the rest used quantitative measures. Emotion-focused coping was associated with worse psychological outcomes, while the effect of problem-focused coping was not regularly associated with better psychological outcomes. Catastrophizing was negatively associated with health-related quality of life. Psychological distress (anxiety, depression) was significantly related to the impairment of health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Patients with IBS cope in different ways when confronted with health and daily-life stressors. The maladaptive strategy of coping is associated with poor health-related quality of life and psychiatric comorbidities but methodological problems limit conclusions regarding the strength and nature of this association. Future research needs to focus on which strategies are most effective at reducing psychological distress in IBS patients.",David L; Fadgyas Stanculete M; Bolba AR; Chiaroni G; Barsan M; Popa SL,2021,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,30,4,485-494,10.15403/jgld-3937,"David, L., Fadgyas Stanculete, M., Bolba, A.

33960587,Efficacy And Safety Of Biophenol-Rich Nutraceuticals In Adults With Inflammatory Gastrointestinal Diseases Or Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Literature Review And Meta-Analysis.,"AIM: Biophenol-rich nutraceuticals may be an adjuvant treatment for Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of biophenol-rich nutraceutical supplementation on CD, UC, SUDD, and IBS on gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS), quality of life (QoL), inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, and adverse events compared to usual care or placebo.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched for randomised controlled trials until 27 April 2020. Outcomes were GIS, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, QoL, and adverse events. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and GRADE were used to appraise studies. Data were pooled using Revman.
RESULTS: Twenty-three trials in CD, UC, and IBS patients were included. Compared with placebo, biophenol-rich nutraceuticals improved GIS (SMD: 0.43 [95%CI: 0.22, 0.63]; GRADE: very low) in UC, CD, and IBS participants. In UC and CD participants, biophenol-rich nutraceuticals improved CRP by 1.6 mg/L [95%CI:0.08, 3.11; GRADE: low], malondialdehyde by 1 mmol/L [95%CI:0.55, 1.38; GRADE: low]; but only resveratrol improved QoL (SMD: -0.84 [95%CI: -1.24, -0.44; GRADE: high). Resveratrol (for UC and CD participants) and peppermint oil (for IBS participants) had greater certainty in the evidence for improving GIS and QoL (GRADE: moderate to high). There was no effect on adverse events (P > .05).

38004138,Examining The Association Between Coffee Intake And The Risk Of Developing Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of brain-gut interaction with a significant impact on quality of life. Coffee is a widely consumed beverage with numerous bioactive compounds that have potential effects on human health and disease states. Current studies on the effect of regular coffee consumption on the risk of developing IBS symptoms have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether coffee intake is associated with developing IBS. A systematic literature search was performed in three electronic databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, from inception until 31 March 2023. All original studies reporting associations between coffee intake and IBS were considered for inclusion. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study, and estimates were pooled, and where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values were calculated. Eight studies comprising 432,022 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. Using a fixed-effects model, coffee drinkers (any intake) had a reduced likelihood of developing IBS compared to controls, with a pooled OR of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.84). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the estimates.

35905421,Risk Of Cervical Cancer In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis Of Population-Based Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: There is increased risk of several malignancies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, evidence regarding risk of cervical cancer in IBD is conflicting. We aimed to investigate the risk of cervical cancer in IBD by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis of unselected, population-based studies.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched using Medical Subject Heading terms, and 2 reviewers independently screened results. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random effects model meta-analysis for risk of cervical cancer in IBD. Subgroup meta-analysis was undertaken to assess risk of cervical cancer by IBD subtype (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), treatment exposure, and grade of lesion.
RESULTS: We screened 1,393 articles to identify 5 population-based studies, including 74,310 patients with IBD and 2,029,087 reference patients, across 5 different countries. Pooled random effects model meta-analysis of these studies did not show statistically significant increased risk for cervical cancer in IBD compared with reference populations (HR: 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-1.63). Meta-analysis by grade of lesion showed increased risk of low-grade cervical lesions (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04-1.28). Meta-analysis by disease subtype indicated no statistically significant increased risk in Crohn's disease (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.83-2.23) or ulcerative colitis (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.72-1.25) or in patients treated with antitumor necrosis factor (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.64-2.21) or thiopurines (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.60-1.50).
DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis of high-quality, unselected population-based studies shows no statistically significant increased risk of cervical cancer in patients with IBD.

32236745,"Rectal Stump Management In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Cohort Study, Systematic Review And Proportional Analysis Of Perioperative Complications.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse local single-institution data and perform a systematic review of the literature to calculate precise risk estimates of rectal stump-related morbidity and mortality following subtotal colectomy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's colitis, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis.
METHODS: Institutional information systems were interrogated to obtain local patient data. A systematic review of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant articles. Fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was performed to calculate pooled incidence estimates, including local data.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included locally and all had their rectal stump closed intra-abdominally. Four patients (8.3%) had a rectal stump perforation and 30-day mortality was 0. Fourteen papers were included in our review alongside local data, with a total of 1330 patients included. Pooled mortality was 1.7% (95% confidence interval, CI 1.0-2.8), pooled incidence of pelvic abscess/sepsis, stump leak and wound infection was 5.7% (95% CI 4.4-7.3), 4.9% (95% CI 3.7-6.6) and 11.3% (95% CI 7.8-16), respectively. Subcutaneous placement of the stump was associated with the highest incidence of stump leak (12.6%, 95% CI 8.3-18.6), and closure of the stump with both staples and suture was associated with the highest incidence of pelvic abscess (11.1%, 95% CI 5.8-20.3). Mortality and the incidence of wound infection were similar across stump closure techniques. There was evidence suggesting considerable heterogeneity and publication bias among studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides estimates of morbidity associated with the rectal stump after subtotal colectomy for IBD. A closed intra-abdominal stump seems to be associated with the highest rate of pelvic abscess/sepsis.

38479936,Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, distension, and altered bowel habits. Probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms, but clinical trials remain conflicting.
AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for IBS patients.
METHODS: We searched relevant trials in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 2000 to June 2023. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes. A risk ratio (RR) and a 95% CI were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies involving 3011 patients were obtained. The results demonstrated that probiotics are more effective than placebo in reducing global IBS symptoms improvement rate (RR = 1.401, 95% CI 1.182-1.662, P < 0.001) and quality of life scores (SMD = 0.286, 95% CI = 0.154-0.418, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that a shorter treatment time (less than eight weeks) could reduce distension scores (SMD = 0.197, 95% CI = 0.038-0.356, P = 0.015). High doses (daily dose of probiotics ≥ 10ˆ10) or multiple strains of probiotics exhibit beneficial effects on abdominal pain (SMD = 0.412, 95% CI = 0.112-0.711, P = 0.007; SMD = 0.590, 95% CI = 0.050-1.129, P = 0.032; respectively). However, there was no significant benefit on global symptom scores (SMD = 0.387, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.653, P = 0.004) with statistically high inter-study heterogeneity (I2 = 91.9%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, there was no significant inter-group difference in terms of adverse events frequency (RR = 0.997, 95% CI 0.845-1.177, P = 0.973).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective and safe for IBS patients. High doses or multiple probiotic strains seem preferable, but definite conclusions are challenging due to the high heterogeneity.

37897138,A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Diet And Nutrient Intake In Adults With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous individual and environmental factors including diet may play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear to what degree dietary intake is affected in individuals with IBS. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize dietary intake of adults with IBS and to compare dietary intake between adults with IBS and non-IBS controls.
METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched through February 2023 for clinical trials and observational studies measuring usual diet in adults with IBS. Pooled weighted averages were estimated for total energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient data. Mean differences (MD) in nutrient intake were estimated for adults with IBS versus non-IBS controls using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the inconsistency index (I2).
KEY RESULTS: Sixty-three full-text articles were included in the review of which 29 studies included both IBS and control subjects. Nutrients not meeting the recommended intake level for any dietary reference values in the IBS population were fiber and vitamin D. Meta-regression by female proportion was positively correlated with total fat intake and negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake. Comparisons between participants with IBS and controls showed significantly lower fiber intake in participants with IBS with high heterogeneity (MD: -1.8; 95% CI: -3.0, -0.6; I2 = 85%).
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: This review suggests that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS; however, overall dietary intake does not appear to be comprised. Causes and consequences of reduced fiber in IBS deserve further study. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS. However, overall intake of other macro- and micronutrients does not appear to be compromised.

32047894,Risk Of Postoperative Infectious Complications From Medical Therapies In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery.
METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases and reference lists of articles dating up to August 2018 for prospective and retrospective studies comparing postoperative infection risk in patients treated with an IBD medication perioperatively with the risk in patients who were not taking that medication. Outcomes were overall infectious complications and intra-abdominal infections within 30 days of surgery.
RESULTS: Sixty-three studies were included. Overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (odds ratio [OR] 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.50) and corticosteroids (OR 1.34; 95% CI, 1.25-1.44) and decreased in those who received 5-aminosalicylic acid (OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87). No difference was observed in those treated with immunomodulators (OR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.25) or anti-integrin agents (OR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.67-1.69). Both corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents were associated with increased intra-abdominal infection risk (OR 1.63; 95% CI, 1.33-2.00 and OR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.08-1.97, respectively), whereas no impact was observed with 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, or anti-integrin therapy. Twenty-two studies had low risk of bias while the remaining studies had very high risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents were associated with increased overall postoperative infection risk as well as intra-abdominal infection in IBD patients, whereas no increased risk was observed for immunomodulators or anti-integrin therapy. Although these results may result from residual confounding rather than from a true biological effect, prospective studies that control for potential confounding factors are required to generate higher-quality evidence.",Law CCY; Koh D; Bao Y; Jairath V; Narula N,2020,Inflammatory bowel diseases,26,12,1796-1807,10.1093/ibd/izaa020,"Law, C.

40750937,Association Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease And The Risk Of Liver Cancer: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Several studies have reported a correlation between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and an elevated risk of various cancers. However, the relationship between IBD and the incidence of liver cancer remains inconclusive. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between IBD and the risk of liver cancer. A systematic search of the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases was performed to identify relevant studies published up to December 22, 2024. Our meta-analysis included nine cohort studies, comprising a total of 7,305,655 participants. The pooled results indicated that patients with IBD had an increased risk of developing liver cancer (RR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.21-2.68; p < 0.0001). An elevated risk was also observed among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (RR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.21-2.62), although this result did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0972). Additionally, female IBD patients (RR = 2.47; 95% CI: 1.35-4.54; p = 0.0442) exhibited a significantly higher risk of liver cancer compared to male patients.",Gu Y; Kong R; Ling A; Ma Z; Lan C; Chen G,2025,Clinical and experimental medicine,25,1,270,10.1007/s10238-025-01727-7,"Gu, Y., Kong, R., Ling, A., Ma, Z., Lan, C., & Chen, G.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.
RESULTS: 12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative colitis (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α-Linolenic acid (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62).

34490319,A Low-Fodmap Diet Improves The Global Symptoms And Bowel Habits Of Adult Ibs Patients: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Background: A low-fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet has been reported to be associated with improving the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, its efficacy as evaluated by different studies remains controversial. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to explore the efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) in alleviating the symptoms of IBS. Methods: A search of the literature for RCTs that assessed the efficacy of an LFD in treating IBS patients was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. The searches in each database were conducted from the inception of the database to February 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations and a third reviewer resolved disagreements. Two independent reviewers also performed eligibility assessments and data extraction. The RCTs that evaluated LFDs vs. a normal IBS or usual diet and assessed changes of IBS symptoms were included in the search. Data were synthesized as the relative risk of global symptoms improvement, mean difference of IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) score, sub-items of IBS-SSS irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life (IBS-QOL), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), stool consistency/frequency, and body mass index (BMI) using a random effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2). The bias of publication was assessed based on Egger's regression analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results: A total of 2,768 citations were identified. After full-text screening, a total of 10 studies were eligible for the systematic review and were subsequently used to compare an LFD with various control interventions in 511 participants. An LFD was associated with the improvement of global symptoms [n = 420; Risk Ratio (RR) = 1.54; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.18 to 2; I 2 = 38%], improvement of stool consistency [n = 434; Mean difference (MD) = -0.25; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.06; I 2= 19%), and a reduction trend of stool frequency (n = 434; MD = -0.28; 95% CI -0.57 to 0.01; I 2 = 68%) compared with control interventions. There was no statistically significant change in IBS-QOL (n = 484; MD = 2.77; 95% CI -2 to 7.55; I 2 = 62%), anxiety score (n = 150; MD = -0.45; 95% CI -3.38 to 2.49; I 2 = 86%), depression score (n = 150; MD = -0.05; 95% CI -2.5 to 2.4; I 2 = 88%), and BMI (n = 110; MD = -0.22; 95% CI -1.89 to 1.45; I 2 = 14%). The overall quality of the data was ""moderate"" for ""global improvement of IBS symptom,"" ""stool consistency,"" ""stool consistency for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D),"" and ""stool frequency for IBS-D,"" and ""low"" or ""very low"" for other outcomes according to GRADE criteria. Conclusion: An LFD is effective in reducing the global symptoms and improving the bowel habits of adult IBS patients. The efficacy for IBS-D patients can also be more pronounced.

32738908,Assessment Of Causal Link Between Psychological Factors And Symptom Exacerbation In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review Utilising Bradford Hill Criteria And Meta-Analysis Of Prospective Cohort Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Psychological stress is a prevalent factor in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with detrimental effects on patients' quality of life and possibly disease course. Although the aetiology of symptom exacerbation in IBD has been explored, determining any causation between psychological stress and symptom worsening remains challenging and requires a methodologically rigorous approach.
AIM: The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to determine a causal relationship between psychological stress and symptom exacerbation in IBD, subsequently utilising Bradford Hill's criteria (approach never used in this topic area before) to evaluate the likelihood of causal associations.
METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies up to July 20, 2019. Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by two independent reviewers. Results of all retained papers were presented as a narrative synthesis. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted on studies meeting the criteria for meta-analysis. Bradford Hill criteria were applied to assess the causality of the relationship between all psychological factors and symptom exacerbation.
RESULTS: The searches yielded 2472 potential articles. Nineteen clinical prospective cohort studies were eligible for the narrative review with five suitable for the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed depression, anxiety and perceived stress did not have a statistically significant association with an increased risk of symptom exacerbation. Four of the Bradford Hill criteria were met which indicates that there is weak to moderate evidence of a causal association between all the psychological factors and disease activity. Inconsistent results and a dearth of studies using the same tools for measuring psychological factors suggest the need for more research to be done to facilitate more conclusive findings.
CONCLUSIONS: This original review utilising Bradford Hill criteria in addition to meta-analysis to evaluate the causality of relationship between psychological factors and symptom exacerbation in IBD provides evidence that psychological factors have a weak to moderate causal involvement in IBD symptom exacerbation. However, when combining this finding with the outcomes of the meta-analysis, we can say that the results were inconclusive. Interventions to reduce the associated psychological impact should be part of the treatment plan for patients with IBD.

32317962,Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disease. Evidence has suggested that probiotics may benefit IBS symptoms. However, clinical trials remain conflicting.
AIMS: To implement a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials regarding the efficacy and safety of probiotics for IBS patients.
METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in Medline(1966 to Jan 2019), Embase(1974 to Jan 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(up to Jan 2019), the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register(up to Jan 2019), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database(1978 to Jan 2019). Risk ratio (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were calculated for continuous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 59 studies, including 6,761 patients, were obtained. The RR of the improvement or response with probiotics versus placebo was 1.52 (95% CI 1.32-1.76), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 71%, P < 0.001). The SMD of Probiotics in improving global IBS symptoms vs. Placebo was -1.8(95% CI -0.30 to -0.06), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 65%, P < 0.001). It was impossible to draw a determinate conclusion. However, there were differences in subgroup analyses of probiotics type, dose, treatment duration, and geographic position. Probiotics seem to be safe by the analysis of adverse events(RR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.92-1.24; I2 = 0, P = 0.83).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective and safe for IBS patients. Single probiotics with a higher dose (daily dose of probiotics ≥1010) and shorter duration (< 8 weeks) seem to be a better choice, but it still needs more trials to prove it.",Li B; Liang L; Deng H; Guo J; Shu H; Zhang L,2020,Frontiers in pharmacology,11,,332,10.3389/fphar.2020.00332,"Li, B., Liang, L., Deng, H., Guo, J., Shu, H., & Zhang, L.

38915086,"Impact Of Sex And Socioeconomic Status On The Likelihood Of Surgery, Hospitalization, And Use Of Medications In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are associated with high healthcare utilization. This systematic review aimed to summarize what is known about the impact of sex, income, and education on the likelihood of bowel surgery, hospitalization, and use of corticosteroids and biologics among patients with IBD.
METHODS: We used EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science to perform a systematic literature search. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis for the impact of sex on the likelihood of surgery and hospitalization. In addition, we performed subgroup analyses of the effect of IBD type (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and age. Finally, meta-regression was undertaken for the year of publication.
RESULTS: In total, 67 studies were included, of which 23 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. In the main meta-analysis, male sex was associated with an increased likelihood of bowel surgery (HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.13;1.78), which was consistent with the subgroup analysis for UC only (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.16; 2.72). Sex did not impact the likelihood of hospitalization (OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.86;1.30), although the subgroup analysis revealed an increased likelihood of hospitalization in CD patients (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28;1.58). In 9 of 10 studies, no significant sex-based differences in the use of biologics were reported, although in 6 of 6 studies, female patients had lower adherence to biologics. In 11 of 13 studies, no significant sex-based difference in the use of corticosteroids was reported. The evidence of the impact of income and education on healthcare utilization was sparse and pointed in different directions. The substantial heterogeneity between studies was explained, in part, by differences in IBD type and age.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review indicate that male patients with IBD are significantly more likely to have surgery than female patients with IBD but are not, overall, more likely to be hospitalized, whereas female patients appear to have statistically significantly lower adherence to biologics compared to male patients. Thus, clinicians should not underestimate the impact of sex on healthcare utilization. Evidence for income- and education-based differences remains sparse.

32530987,Pharmacologic Treatments For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Umbrella Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Multiple pharmacologic treatments are available for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and a large body of evidence has been presented. However, the strength and credibility of the evidence have not been comprehensively evaluated. We aimed to review the systematic reviews and meta- analyses of pharmacologic treatments for IBS and evaluate the credibility of the findings.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library from inception to September 2019 for systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for IBS. We summarized relative ratios (RR), evaluated the credibility of the evidence and classified the evidence into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, and weak.
RESULTS: We included 11 systematic reviews with 40 meta-analyses (330 randomized controlled trials and 86,459 participants) assessing 10 treatment categories and 2 drugs. Most of the pharmacologic treatments were significantly superior over placebo as reported by the included meta-analyses. The evidence for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 antagonists (RR=1.56, 95%CI: 1.43-1.71), antispasmodics (RR=1.19, 95%CI: 1.02-1.39), and alosetron (RR=1.46, 95%CI: 1.26-1.71) were highly suggestive for relieving global IBS symptoms. 5-HT4 agonists (RR= 1.26, 95%CI: 1.19-1.34) and guanylate cyclase-C (GCC) agonists (RR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.54-1.95) were found to give convincing evidence for the improvement of the responder rate. 5-HT3 antagonists (RR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.26-1.38) offered convincing evidence for relieving abdominal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT4 agonists and GCC agonists, antispasmodics, and alosetron were suggestive for the treatment of IBS. However, owing to the risk of bias in randomization methods, the results for GCC should be interpreted with caution.",Chen M; Tang TC; Qin D; Yue L; Zheng H,2020,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,29,2,199-209,10.15403/jgld-817,"Chen, M., Tang, T.

37725328,Hypertension In Oral Lichen Planus: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the prevalence and magnitude of the association of hypertension in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published before May 2022, not restricted by publication language or date. The methodological quality and risk of bias of primary-level studies were critically assessed. Meta-analyses were performed, as well as meta-regression, stratified, sensitivity and small-study effects analyses, a Galbraith (radial) plot, and trial sequential analysis. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE system.
RESULTS: 104 studies, including 16,587 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The results show that patients who suffer from OLP have a high prevalence of hypertension (PP = 24.17%, 95% CI = 21.45-27.00), with a low quality of evidence. A significant association between hypertension and oral lichen planus was also reported (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.63, p = 0.04), showing a moderate quality of evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OLP could be at an increased risk of suffering from hypertension which is probably due to multiple factors.

37233510,Efficacy And Security Of Tetrodotoxin In The Treatment Of Cancer-Related Pain: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The pharmacological treatment of cancer-related pain is unsatisfactory. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) has shown analgesia in preclinical models and clinical trials, but its clinical efficacy and safety have not been quantified. For this reason, our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical evidence that was available. A systematic literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 1 March 2023 in order to identify published clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and security of TTX in patients with cancer-related pain, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Five articles were selected, three of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The number of responders to the primary outcome (≥30% improvement in the mean pain intensity) and those suffering adverse events in the intervention and placebo groups were used to calculate effect sizes using the log odds ratio. The meta-analysis showed that TTX significantly increased the number of responders (mean = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.19-1.16, p = 0.0065) and the number of patients suffering non-severe adverse events (mean = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.31-1.95, p = 0.0068). However, TTX did not increase the risk of suffering serious adverse events (mean = 0.75; 95% CI: -0.43-1.93, p = 0.2154). In conclusion, TTX showed robust analgesic efficacy but also increased the risk of suffering non-severe adverse events.

35879058,Efficacy Of A Restrictive Diet In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dietary factors can aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many IBS patients try restrictive diets to relieve their symptoms, but the types of diets with an exacerbating factor are unknown. Therefore, this paper reports the results of a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) reviewing the efficacy of food restriction diets in IBS.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched until July 21, 2021, to retrieve RCTs assessing the efficacy of restriction diets in adults with IBS. Two independent reviewers performed the eligibility assessment and data abstraction. RCTs that evaluated a restriction diet versus a control diet and assessed the improvement in global IBS symptoms were included. These trials reported a dichotomous assessment of the overall response to therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 1,949 citations were identified. After full-text screening, 14 RCTs were considered eligible for the systematic review and network meta-analysis. A starch- and sucrose-reduced diet and a diet with low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) showed significantly better results than a usual diet. Symptom flare-ups in patients on a gluten- free diet were also significantly lower than in those on high-gluten diets.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that the starch- and sucrose-reduced, low FODMAP, and gluten-free diets had superior effects in reducing IBS symptoms.

31898645,Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional bowel disorder and the evidence shows most drug therapies in the treatment of IBS are weak. Recently, some studies showed probiotics may have a positive effect in IBS and they are widely used to improve the symptom of IBS, which indicate probiotics may play an important role in the treatment of IBS. However, the exact effectiveness and safety of probiotics are largely unknown. This systematic review focuses on identifying the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of IBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data sources were searched up to February 2019. Databases included MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics including complex or individual probiotics with placebo or no therapy were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of all RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias and Jadad scale. Outcomes included symptom-relevant and patient-relevant characteristics, such as symptom relief, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, quality of life, and adverse event.
RESULTS: This review includes 28 studies with a total of 3606 participants. Particular combinations of probiotics, or specific species and strains, showed probiotics have beneficial effect on overall IBS symptoms (22 studies, n = 3144, RR of improvement in overall IBS symptoms = 1.5, CI 1.23 to 1.83) or overall IBS symptom and abdominal pain scores (18 studies, n = 2766, SMD = -0.31, CI -0.45 to -0.17). In addition, adverse events were not significantly higher with probiotics (8 studies, n = 923, RR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.85-1.31). However, there was no significant benefit on individual IBS symptom scores and quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows particular combinations, species or strains of probiotics are effective for overall IBS symptoms. However, it is hard to derive a definite conclusion due to high heterogeneity and unclear risk of bias of some trials. Large well-designed and rigorous trials are warranted.",Sun JR; Kong CF; Qu XK; Deng C; Lou YN; Jia LQ,2020,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,26,2,66-77,10.4103/sjg.SJG_384_19,"Sun, J.

31624009,Nutritional And Dietary Strategy In The Clinical Care Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.",Hsieh MS; Hsu WH; Wang JW; Wang YK; Hu HM; Chang WK; Chen CY; Wu DC; Kuo FC; Su WW,2020,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,119,12,1742-1749,10.1016/j.jfma.2019.09.005,"Hsieh, M.

36130090,Perianal Crohn'S Disease And The Development Of Colorectal And Anal Cancer: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the literature on the incidence and risk factors for colorectal cancer and anal cancer in patients with perianal Crohn's disease.
METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. A meta-analysis was then conducted using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Five studies were included in the systematic review. Of the total patients, 26.5% had perianal Crohn's disease. The median follow-up was 6 years. In total, 127 cases of colorectal cancer were found [0.43% of the included Crohn's disease patients]. Perianal involvement was present in 50% of colorectal cancer patients [0.89% of the population]. Three of the studies specified the cancer to be rectal or anal, which were present in 68 and 24 cases [0.3% and 0.1% of patients], respectively. In a subgroup analysis of rectal and anal cancer, perianal involvement was most frequent in anal cancer, accounting for 46% of the cases. In the rectal cancer group, 37% had perianal involvement. The higher incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with perianal Crohn's disease was confirmed in a meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: Half of the patients with colorectal cancer and anal cancer were found to have perianal Crohn's disease. In patients with perianal involvement, there was a higher percentage of anal cancer compared with rectal cancer. These results support the theory that patients with perianal Crohn's disease are at increased risk for developing colorectal and anal cancer.

40095460,"Paradigm Shift In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Management: Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, And Emerging Therapies.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management stands at the cusp of a transformative era, with recent breakthroughs heralding a paradigm shift in treatment strategies. Traditionally, IBD therapeutics revolved around immunosuppressants, but the landscape has evolved significantly. Recent approvals of etrasimod, upadacitinib, mirikizumab, and risankizumab have introduced novel mechanisms of action, offering renewed hope for IBD patients. These medications represent a departure from the status quo, breaking years of therapeutic stagnation. Precision medicine, involving Artificial Intelligence, is a pivotal aspect of this evolution, tailoring treatments based on genetic profiles, disease characteristics, and individual responses. This approach optimizes treatment efficacy, and paves the way for personalized care. Yet, the rising cost of IBD therapies, notably biologics, poses challenges, impacting healthcare budgets and patient access. Ongoing research strives to assess cost-effectiveness, guiding policy decisions to ensure equitable access to advanced treatments. Looking ahead, the future of IBD management holds great promise. Emerging therapies, precision medicine, and ongoing research into novel targets promise to reshape the IBD treatment landscape.

36757832,Prevalence Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Its Association With Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
METHODS: A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar from inception to 31st January 2020 without any limitations on article type or language for studies reporting data on CRC on patients with IBS. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of CRC among patients with IBS. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were eligible for data extraction and quantitative analysis. Of them, 11 were included in the meta-analysis (IBS n = 284 366, no-IBS n = 8 390 509). The pooled prevalence of CRC in patients with IBS was 0.96% (95% CI-0.184%-2.344%). The prevalence was lowest in the constipation-predominant IBS (pooled prevalence 1.126%. Patients with IBS-D and IBS-U had an equal pooled prevalence of CRC (2.49%). Eleven studies compared the prevalence of CRC in patients with IBS with a control population. The pooled OR was 2.8 (CI 2.305-3.294).
CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased risk of CRC among patients diagnosed with IBS, primarily in the first year after IBS diagnosis.

33759041,The Characteristics Of Gastrointestinal Symptoms In Patients With Severe Covid-19: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Although primarily a respiratory illness, several studies have shown that COVID-19 causes elevation of liver enzymes and various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms contributed toward COVID-19 severity, and identify the GI symptoms characteristic of severe COVID-19. We conducted a literature search of PubMed from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, and identified all reports with GI symptoms reported. A meta-analysis comparing the severity of COVID-19 with the presence of liver enzyme elevation and GI symptoms was performed using RevMan version 5.4. Pooled data from 15,305 unique reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive COVID-19 patients from 44 studies were analyzed. We found that the severe COVID-19 patients significantly had abdominal pain compared to the non-severe COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.17-6.27, Z = 2.32, p = 0.02, I2 = 0%) by analyzed 609 patients of 4 studies who reported both abdominal pain and COVID-19 severity. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting between the two groups. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that abdominal pain could be characteristic of severe COVID-19 infections. Compared with other viral infections that primarily infect the respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 have a slightly lower frequency of diarrheal symptoms with abdominal pain. However, to confirm this, further studies with COVID-19 patients across various countries and ethnicities are required.",Hayashi Y; Wagatsuma K; Nojima M; Yamakawa T; Ichimiya T; Yokoyama Y; Kazama T; Hirayama D; Nakase H,2021,Journal of gastroenterology,56,5,409-420,10.1007/s00535-021-01778-z,"Hayashi, Y., Wagatsuma, K., Nojima, M., Yamakawa, T., Ichimiya, T., Yokoyama, Y., Kazama, T., Hirayama, D., & Nakase, H.

39235428,The Effects Of Vitamin D Intake And Status On Symptom Severity And Quality-Of-Life In Adults With Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Ibs): A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Many individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have insufficient or deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status; however, it is not clear if improved vitamin D nutritional status through higher intake can improve symptom severity and quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify if changes in vitamin D intake or status affect symptom severity and quality of life in adults with IBS.Data Sources: MEDLINE®, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Global Health, EMBASE, and Web-of-Science databases were systematically searched for relevant articles to August 12, 2024, in the English language.Study Selection: Clinical trials, prospective observational studies, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses reporting the effect of vitamin D intake or status on IBS-related outcomes were included.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Article review and data extraction were conducted by 2 authors following the PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses and the Nutrition Quality Evaluation Strengthening Tools to assess risk of bias were employed for randomized controlled trials.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary outcomes included measures of serum 25(OH)D status, symptom severity, and quality of life.
RESULTS: 12 studies from 15 articles were included (n = 7 RCTs; n = 3 single-arm interventions; n = 2 MR). Seven study populations had deficient (<20 ng/mL) and three had insufficient (21-29 ng/mL) baseline serum 25(OH)D status. RCTs measured changes in serum 25(OH)D after 6-26 wks with 3,000 IU daily to 50,000 IU bi-weekly vitamin D dosages. Meta-analyses of low risk-of-bias RCTs revealed increased 25(OH)D levels in groups treated with oral vitamin D compared to placebo (n = 5; Pooled mean difference [95% CI]: 20.33 [12.91, 27.74] ng/mL; I2 = 97.9%). Quality of life scores improved significantly in deficient populations (n = 3; 3.19 [2.14, 4.24]; I2 = 0.0%). Non-significant decreased trends in IBS symptom severity were shown across populations (n = 6: -25.89 [-55.26, 3.48]; I2 = 92.8%).

38418112,Occurrence Of Colorectal Cancer After A Negative Colonoscopy In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite the application of colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance guidelines, the detection of early neoplastic lesions might be difficult in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To explore the risk of post-colonoscopy CRC (PCCRC) in patients with IBD we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed (PROSPERO; no. CRD42023453049). We included studies reporting the 3-year PCCRC (PCCRC-3y) prevalence, according to World Endoscopy Organization (WEO)-endorsed definition, in IBD and non-IBD patients. As primary outcome we evaluated the PCCRC-3y prevalence, according to WEO definitions, in IBD- and non-IBD patients and calculated the odds ratio (OR). The secondary outcome was to assess risk factors for PCCRC development in IBD patients.
RESULTS: Three retrospective observational cohort studies were included. The pooled PCCRC-3y rate in patients with IBD was 30.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=24.4-37.5%] and in non-IBD patients was 6.8% (95%CI=6.2-7.4%). The PCCRC-3y occurrence in IBD patients was significantly higher than that in non-IBD patients (OR=6.04; 95%CI=4.04-9.4; I2=95%), but a high heterogeneity among studies was noted. Furthermore, patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) had a significantly higher prevalence of PCCRC than patients with Crohn's Disease (CD): 30.9% (95%CI=27.8-34.2%) vs. 22.3% (95%CI=18-27%), respectively (OR=1.6, 95%CI=1.2-2.2; I2=0%).
CONCLUSION: One-third of CRC in IBD patients were PCCRC, and these numbers were significantly higher when compared with those in non-IBD patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of PCCRC in patients with UC was higher compared to those with CD. However, prospective studies are required to better characterize risk factors for PCCRC development in patients with IBD.",Scotti GB; Iannone I; DE Padua C; Crocetti D; Fiori G; Sapienza P; Fiori E; Avenia S; Lamazza A,2024,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",38,2,523-530,10.21873/invivo.13470,"Scotti, G.

31987249,Western Herbal Medicines In The Treatment Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
DESIGN: A computer-based search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, GreenFILE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. A hand-search of the bibliographies of relevant papers and previous meta-analyses and reviews was also undertaken. Trials were included in the review if they were double-blind and placebo-controlled investigating the effects of Western herbal medicines on IBS-related symptoms or quality of life. There were no language restrictions. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. For herbal medicines where there was more than 1 trial of similar design, data were synthesised using relative risk of symptoms improving using the random effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty-three trials were identified that met all eligibility criteria. Seventeen of these evaluated peppermint essential oil, fifteen other Western herbal medicines, and one trial evaluated peppermint oil in one arm and aniseed essential oil in the other arm. Eighteen different herbal preparations were evaluated in these trials. Data suggests that a number of Western herbal medicines may provide relief of IBS symptoms. Meta-analyses suggest that peppermint essential oil is both efficacious and well-tolerated in the short-term management of IBS. Aloe vera and asafoetida also demonstrated efficacy in reducing global IBS symptoms in meta-analyses. The herbal formulas STW 5, STW 5-II and Carmint, along with Ferula assa-foetida, Pimpenella anisum oil, the combination of Curcumin and Foeniculum vulgare oil, and the blend of Schinopsis lorentzii, Aesculus hippocastanum, and peppermint essential oil also demonstrated efficacy in rigorously-designed clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: A number of Western herbal medicines show promise in the treatment of IBS. With the exception of peppermint essential oil, Aloe vera, and asafoetida, however, none of the positive trials have been replicated. This lack of replication limits the capacity to make definitive statements of efficacy for these herbal medicines.",Hawrelak JA; Wohlmuth H; Pattinson M; Myers SP; Goldenberg JZ; Harnett J; Cooley K; Van De Venter C; Reid R; Whitten DL,2020,Complementary therapies in medicine,48,,102233,10.1016/j.ctim.2019.102233,"Hawrelak, J.

37682003,Efficacy And Safety Of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy In Fistulizing Crohn'S Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) delivers 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, increasing tissue oxygen levels and regulating inflammatory pathways. Mounting evidence suggests that HBOT may be effective for inflammatory bowel disease. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the efficacy and safety of HBOT in fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the EMBASE, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases according to the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses"" criteria. Study bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook guidelines.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies with 164 patients were included in the analysis. For all fistula subtypes, the pooled overall clinical response was 87% (95% CI: 0.70-0.95, I2 = 0) and the pooled clinical remission was 59% (95% CI: 0.35-0.80, I2 = 0). The overall clinical response was 89%, 84%, and 29% for perianal, enterocutaneous, and rectovaginal fistulas, respectively. On meta-regression, hours in the chamber and the number of HBOT sessions were not found to correlate with clinical response. The pooled number of adverse events was low at 51.7 per 10,000 HBOT sessions for all fistula types (95% CI: 16.8-159.3, I2 = 0). The risk of bias was observed across all studies.

35509010,The Efficacy Of Vitamin D Supplementation For Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder involving gut-brain interactions with limited effective treatment options. Vitamin D deficiency is commonly observed in patients with IBS, but whether vitamin D supplementation ameliorates IBS is controversial in randomized controlled trials. The present systematic review and meta-analysis explored the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in patients with IBS.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search of potentially relevant publications from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies and the Web of Science up until January 2022. We assessed the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL) and IBS total score (IBS-TS) before and after vitamin D supplementation intervention.
RESULTS: We included four randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving 335 participants. The differences in IBS-SSS score between participants in the intervention group and the placebo group increased after intervention (WMD: -55.55, 95% CI: -70.22 to -40.87, I2 = 53.7%, after intervention; WMD: -3.17, 95% CI: -18.15 to 11.81, I2 = 0.0%, before intervention). Participants receiving vitamin D supplementation showed greater improvement in IBS-SSS after intervention than participants receiving placebo treatment (WMD: -84.21, 95% CI: -111.38 to -57.05, I2 = 73.2%; WMD: -28.29, 95% CI: -49.95 to -6.62, I2 = 46.6%, respectively). Vitamin D supplementation was also superior to placebo in IBS-QoL improvement (WMD: 14.98, 95% CI: 12.06 to 17.90, I2 = 0.0%; WMD: 6.55, 95% CI: -2.23 to 15.33, I2 = 82.7%, respectively).

35256335,The Association Between Fusobacterium Nucleatum And Cancer Colorectal: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The etiological factors of colorectal cancer (CRC) are not precisely known, although genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. A possible association with Fusobacterium nucleatum may provide opportunities for an early diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To review studies that address the association between F. nucleatum and CRC.
METHODS: The MEDLINE PubMed database was searched using the terms «colorectal cancer» and ""Fusobacterium nucleatum"", retrieving publications published up to January 1 2020. Stata software was used for a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The systematic review included 57 articles. Meta-analysis results indicated a more frequent presence of F. nucleatum in CRC tumour tissue samples in comparison to control samples of healthy tissue, with an odds ratio of 4.558 (95% CI: 3.312-6.272), and in comparison, to control samples of colorectal adenomas, with an odds ratio of 3.244 (95 % CI: 2.359-4.462).

39407084,Efficacy And Safety Of A Low-Fodmap Diet In Combination With A Gluten-Free Diet For Adult Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Common gastrointestinal disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is marked by symptoms like changed bowel habits, bloating, and stomach ache. A low-FODMAP combined gluten-free diet (LF-GFD) has been suggested as a possible therapy for IBS symptoms management.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether a LF-GFD would help patients with IBS.
METHODS: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of LF-GFD in the treatment of IBS patients. Using measurements including the visual analog scale (VAS) for bloating and pain, the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), and IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of LF-GFD in reducing IBS symptoms. Furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of LF-GFD utilizing the self- rating depression scale (SDS) and self- rating anxiety scale (SAS).
RESULTS: A total of 437 patients (221 on LF-GFD diet and 216 on GFD) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. The combined results indicated that LF-GFD reduced the VAS bloating ratings (RR = - 0.58, 95%CI - 0.92-0.23, P = 0.0010, I2 = 83%) and the VAS pain scores (RR = - 0.42, 95%CI - 0.66-0.19, P = 0.005, I2 = 58%). In addition, LF-GFD indicated a substantial enhancement in IBS-SSS scores (MD = - 1.42, 95%CI - 2.74-0.10, P = 0.03, I2 = 24%) and IBS-QoL ratings (MD = 3.75, 95%CI 0.98-6.53, P = 0.008, I2 = 33%). Moreover, the LF-GFD group showed a substantial drop in SDS (MD = - 2.56, 95%CI - 3.38-1.74, P < 0.00001, I2 = 65%) and SAS (MD = - 4.30, 95%CI - 6.53-2.24, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) scores compared to the GFD group.

37541185,"Histological Disease Activity As Predictor Of Clinical Relapse, Hospitalization, And Surgery In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of histological remission on short- and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not well established. We assessed risk of clinical relapse, hospitalization, and need for surgery in patients achieving histological remission in comparison with active histological disease.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, and conference abstracts from inception to November 2022. Our main outcome was the rate of clinical relapse in patients with IBD who reached histological remission vs patients with active histological disease. Secondary outcomes were clinical complications of IBD such as hospitalization and need for surgery. The endpoints were investigated at 2 time points, 6 to 12 months (short term) and >12 months (long term).
RESULTS: Short-term outcome analysis showed that the risk of clinical relapse was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis patients with active histological disease in comparison with patients at histological remission (risk ratio [RR], 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-3.44; P < .01). The risk of hospitalization in ulcerative colitis patients was not significant among the 2 groups (RR, 4.22; 95% CI, 0.91-19.62; P = .07). Long-term outcome analysis demonstrated that the risk of clinical relapse (RR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.55-2.76; P < .01), need for surgery (RR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.53-6.45; P < .01), and hospitalization (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.59-4.00; P < .01) was significantly higher in patients with active histological disease.

37836500,Herbal Remedies For Constipation-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND: Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Conventional treatments for IBS-C often provide limited efficiency, leading to an increasing interest in exploring herbal remedies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal remedies in the management of IBS-C.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to July 2023 and data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Overall, the included studies demonstrated some evidence of the beneficial effects of herbal remedies on IBS-C symptoms, including improvements in bowel frequency, stool consistency, abdominal pain, and quality of life. However, the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measures limited the ability to perform a meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that herbal remedies may have potential benefits in the management of IBS-C. However, the quality of evidence is limited, and further well-designed, large-scale RCTs are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of specific herbal remedies for IBS-C.

35911986,Effects And Mechanisms Of Acupuncture On Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction with challenging treatment. According to evidence-based studies, acupuncture is likely to be a promising therapy and subservient adjunct for IBS. Mechanism study of acupuncture based on related clinical trials of high quality, nevertheless, is still vacant.
AIM: This study aims to assess the results and qualities of current clinical evidence and conclude the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of acupuncture on IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D).
METHODS: Literature from four databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science, was systematically searched to obtain eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which contained mechanism research of acupuncture treatment in IBS-D patients. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction and quality evaluation using the RevMan 5.4.1 software.
RESULTS: Ten trials that covered 19 items related to mechanism research were included in this review. Acupuncture was reported to improve IBS-D symptoms and quality of life, with positive effects in regulating brain-gut peptides, cerebral activities, neuroendocrine functions, psychological state, and inflammatory GI and hypersensitive intestinal tracts.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has potential influence on pathophysiology alterations such as regulating brain-gut peptides, altering cerebral connectivity and activity, promoting neuroendocrine functions and mental state, and mitigating inflammation as well as hypersensitivity of bowels in IBS-D patients, but further studies of high quality are still necessary.

METHODS: We searched four databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared FMT with a control intervention in patients with IBS. The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool was chosen for appraisal. Meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted. Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence (CoE).
RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs with a total of 615 participants. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference between the FMT and control groups in terms of clinical responses (relative risk [RR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-2.33) and changes in IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) scores (standardised mean difference [SMD] = - 0.31, 95% CI - 0.72 to 0.09) and IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) scores (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI - 0.09 to 0.69). Subgroup analysis revealed that in studies with low RoB and using endoscopy, nasojejunal tube and rectal enema delivery, FMT led to a significant improvement in clinical responses and changes in IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL scores. TSA suggested that the current evidence is inconclusive and that the CoE is very low.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that patients with IBS may benefit from FMT especially when it is administered via endoscopy, nasojejunal tube or rectal enema. However, the certainty of evidence is very low. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of FMT for IBS treatment.

36443973,Children And Adolescents With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Treatment And Management.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that causes stomach pain in children and adolescents. It may also impact one's quality of life. IBS is linked to gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea and constipation. Despite the identification of several potential pathophysiological pathways, the aetiology of IBS remained unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to discuss the diagnosis, pathogenesis, case studies and treatment of Irritable bowel syndrome in children and adolescents.
METHODS: This systematic review covered relevant papers from the previous ten years that were accessible in Science Direct, Elsevier, NCBI, and Web of Science related to the pathophysiology and function of pharmacological drugs such as antidepressants, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and antibiotics in children with irritable bowel syndrome.
RESULTS: Only a few prospective therapy techniques have been investigated in children, and even fewer of those have been demonstrated to be effective. This article presents case studies including 50-59 children, which demonstrate a favourable acceptable impact that is more effective than a placebo in terms of reducing symptoms and improving the overall quality of life in children who have irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, the majority of the pathophysiological explanations and treatment options discussed are based on adult studies. These major issues arose when treating paediatric IBS, and they must be addressed in order to properly treat children with IBS. Trials that focus on many combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies seem to be more helpful.
DISCUSSION: In recent years, a number of systematic reviews have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of medication treatments in children for IBS; however, the dependability of these systematic reviews needs to be further investigated owing to the various experimental designs and levels of evidence used. This article highlights paediatric therapy options, including pharmaceutical medications such as antidepressants, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and antibiotics.

40765115,Effects Of A Low Fodmap Diet In Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Patient Experiences: A Mixed Methods Systematic Literature Review And Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: A low FODMAP diet reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but its impact on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is less established. This systematic review aimed to: (1) assess the effect of a low FODMAP diet in IBD and (2) understand patient experiences when implementing the low FODMAP diet.
METHODS: Four databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and CENTRAL) were systematically searched. RCTs evaluating a low FODMAP diet in IBD on disease activity, inflammatory markers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life (QoL), and qualitative studies reporting patient experiences of low FODMAP interventions (in either IBS or IBD), were included. Outcome data were meta-analysed as standardised mean differences or odds ratios. Qualitative data underwent content analysis using the Health Belief Model.
RESULTS: Five RCTs (n = 224) and two qualitative studies (n = 30 IBS patients, no studies in IBD) were included. Compared with controls, there was no effect of a low FODMAP diet on disease activity (Crohn's disease: SMD -0.33; -0.77, 0.11; ulcerative colitis: SMD -0.31; -0.78, 0.15) or faecal calprotectin (SMD -0.20; -0.49, 0.09), but lower severity of global IBS symptoms (SMD -0.56; -0.90, 0.23) and higher QoL scores (SMD 0.43; 0.05, 0.81) at end of intervention. Patients with IBS described implementation as burdensome (Severity, Barriers), inadequate professional support (Susceptibility) and found it difficult to interpret information (Susceptibility, Barriers). Meal plans and recipes (Cue to action and Self-efficacy) gained through dietitian-led information sessions were valued (Benefits).
CONCLUSIONS: A low FODMAP diet does not impact IBD disease activity and inflammation markers, but leads to improved gastrointestinal symptoms compared with controls. The diet should be considered for improving functional gastrointestinal symptoms, but not an IBD treatment. There are minimal studies about patient experiences implementing the low FODMAP diet, all in IBS. Future research should assess patient experiences of low FODMAP diet implementation, specific to IBD.

36871131,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Is Not Associated With An Increased Risk Of Polyps And Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in the US. Several factors are associated with increased/decreased CRC risk and often linked to adenomatous colorectal polyps (CRP). Recent studies suggest a lower risk of neoplastic lesions among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. We aimed to systematically assess the occurrence of CRC and CRP in IBS patients.
METHODS: Searches of the Medline, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were performed, blindly and independently, by two investigators. Studies of CRC or CRP incidence in IBS patients (diagnosed by Rome or other symptom-based criteria) were eligible for inclusion. CRC and CRP effect estimates were pooled in meta-analyses using random models.
RESULTS: Of 4941 non-duplicate studies, 14 were included, comprising 654,764 IBS patients and 2,277,195 controls in 8 cohort studies, and 26,641 IBS patients and 87,803 controls in 6 cross-sectional studies. Pooled analysis revealed a significantly decreased prevalence of CRP in IBS subjects vs. controls, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.29 (95% CI (0.15, 0.54)). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 96%, p < 0.01). This finding persisted when studies which did not report pre-cancerous polyps separately were excluded (OR 0.23, 95% CI (0.15, 0.35), I2 = 85%, p < 0.01). CRC prevalence was lower in IBS subjects, but this did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.40, 95% CI (0.09, 1.77]).
CONCLUSION: Our analyses reveal a decreased incidence of colorectal polyps in IBS, although CRC did not reach significance.

37747431,Prognostic Impact Of Serum Testosterone In Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In daily practice, there is an unmet medical need for biomarkers that facilitate therapeutic decision-making in the metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) scenario. Although recent studies have highlighted the potential of testosterone as a prognostic and predictive marker in prostate cancer, the evidence is controversial. The objective of this review was to summarize and analyze the scientific evidence regarding the prognostic role of basal testosterone levels in patients with mHSPC.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed. Three authors selected the articles from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library electronic databases. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the selected articles suggest that low testosterone levels before starting hormonal blockade imply a worse prognosis for patients with mHSPC. However, the quality of the evidence is poor, the studies are heterogeneous, and it is not possible to meta-analyze most of the published results.
SUMMARY: Testosterone is an accessible and affordable biomarker. If it were correctly demonstrated that it harbors a prognostic and/or predictive role in the mHSPC setting, it could represent an advance in decision-making in these patients. Well designed prospective studies are needed to correctly answer this question.",Puche-Sanz I; Chiu P; Morillo AC; Gomez-Gomez E,2023,Current opinion in urology,33,6,472-481,10.1097/MOU.0000000000001132,"Puche-Sanz, I., Chiu, P., Morillo, A.

A total of 33 RCTs involving 4,321 patients were identified. Overall, probiotics significantly improved global IBS symptoms compared to placebos (standardised mean difference = -0.32, 95% confidence interval: -0.48 to -0.15; P <0.001), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 72%; P <0.001). This remained apparent in both single- and multi-strain probiotic interventions as well as synbiotic formulations. However, evidence regarding prebiotics was scarce.

39560589,Efficacy Of Acupuncture Treatment For Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Comorbid Anxiety And Depression: A Meta-Analysis And Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Presently, a diverse range of Western medical interventions are accessible for the management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) concomitant with comorbid anxiety and depression. However, the concomitant adverse effects have also surfaced, exerting strain on healthcare resources and the socio-economic structure. In recent times, the benefits of acupuncture in the management of IBS-D with coexisting anxiety and depression have become progressively evident. Nevertheless, a paucity of evidence-based medicine exists to substantiate the utilization of acupuncture for the treatment of IBS-D with anxiety and depression. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture as an intervention for IBS-D with comorbid anxiety and depression.
METHODS: We searched 7 databases, including the Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Academic Journals Full-text Database, VIP Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to acupuncture treatment for IBS with anxiety and depression, published from database inception to August 1, 2023. RevMan 5.4 and Stata 17.0 software were used for meta-analysis of relevant outcome measures.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 16 RCTs, involving 1305 IBS-D patients (691 in the experimental group and 614 in the control group). The meta-analysis results showed that compared to oral medication, acupuncture therapy improved HAMD scores (MD = 0.88, 95% CI = [0.68, 1.07], P < .00001), HAMA scores (MD = 2.32, 95% CI = [1.70, 2.93], P < .00001), self-rating anxiety scale scores (MD = 11.67, 95% CI = [10.85, 12.49], P < .00001), SDS scores (MD = 9.84, 95% CI = [8.52, 11.16], P < .00001), IBS-SSS scores (MD = 37.48, 95% CI = [12.17, 62.78], P = .004), overall response rate (MD = 1.27, 95% CI = [1.20, 1.35], P < .00001), and relapse rate (MD = 0.27, 95% CI = [0.16, 0.47], P < .00001) in patients with IBS-D comorbid with anxiety and depression.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture treatment has a definite and beneficial effect on IBS-D patients with comorbid anxiety and depression.",Wang Z; Hou Y; Sun H; Wang Z; Zhang H,2024,Medicine,103,46,e40207,10.1097/MD.0000000000040207,"Wang, Z., Hou, Y., Sun, H., Wang, Z., & Zhang, H.

40035292,The Effects Of Low Fodmap Diet On Gut Microbiota Regulation: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet on gut microbiota regulation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Data databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low FODMAP diets with normal diets were included. The primary outcome was the effect on intestinal flora. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. Ten RCTs involving 590 participants were included in the analysis. The low FODMAP diet showed a significant positive effect on intestinal flora compared to normal diets (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI [0.01, 0.64], p = 0.003). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 67.5%). Subgroup analysis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients revealed no significant difference between low FODMAP and normal diets (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.32], p = 0.306), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 17.0%). No significant publication bias was detected (Egger's test, p = 0.328). This meta-analysis suggests that a low FODMAP diet may have a positive effect on gut microbiota regulation. However, the effect appears to be less pronounced in IBS patients. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the long-term impact of low FODMAP diets on gut health across various gastrointestinal disorders.",Chu P; He Y; Hu F; Wang X,2025,Journal of food science,90,3,e70072,10.1111/1750-3841.70072,"Chu, P., He, Y., Hu, F., & Wang, X.

38021554,"Prevalence, Risk Factors, And Management Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome In Saudi Arabia: A Systematic Review.","The prevalence and associated risk factors of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been a significant area of focus in several studies conducted in Saudi Arabia. These studies have looked at varied populations, including school teachers, university students, and the general populace. The reported prevalence rates for IBS vary substantially across studies, ranging from 7.9% to an astounding 49.3%. The average prevalence noted across these studies is about 24%. The aim of this review is to collate, compare, and analyze data from these studies, hoping to shed light on the key risk factors and demographic trends associated with IBS in Saudi Arabia. This review encompasses data from 20 studies, aggregating information from 17,018 participants. The research methodologies adopted by each of these studies have been analyzed, especially focusing on their sample sizes, which vary significantly. Furthermore, the review incorporates details on the socio-demographic attributes of the participants, including age specifics, gender representation, and geographical distribution within Saudi Arabia. The results demonstrate a wide variability in IBS prevalence among different groups. The overall prevalence of IBS in Saudi Arabia based on the provided data is approximately 24%. Gender-based breakdown in some studies indicated varying prevalence among males and females, which indicated that females are more prone to the disease. The same for certain age groups, specifically between 51 and 60 years, which showed slightly higher rates. Factors such as educational discipline, living conditions, mental health, dietary habits, family history of IBS, and certain comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus were found to influence the occurrence of IBS in different cohorts. Moreover, lifestyle factors such as low water intake, lack of dietary fiber, stress, and even caffeine intake were associated with IBS. Socioeconomic aspects, including family income levels and academic performance, were also hinted to have a potential link with IBS prevalence. In light of the presented data, it is evident that IBS prevalence in Saudi Arabia is influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from genetic and dietary to psychological and socioeconomic. The substantial variations in prevalence across different cohorts suggest the need for a more nuanced understanding of this condition, specifically tailored to the unique demographics and cultural contexts of Saudi Arabia. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions, considering these multifaceted determinants, are crucial for the effective management of IBS in the region.",Makkawy EA; Abdulaal IE; Kalaji FR; Makkawi M; Alsindi N,2023,Cureus,15,10,e47440,10.7759/cureus.47440,"Makkawy, E.

39862384,Effects Of Probiotics And Diet Management In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.,"CONTEXT: The efficacy of probiotics and diet management in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial, and their relative effectiveness remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics, diet management, and their combination on IBS.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 10, 2023, for relevant studies, including symptom relief, IBS-symptom severity score (-SSS), and IBS-quality of life measure (-QOL).
DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently performed the data extraction and quality assessment.
DATA ANALYSIS: A network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach and a random-effects model to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI.
RESULTS: Forty-four articles were eligible for this study. In relieving IBS symptoms, compared with a sham diet, a low-fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (low-FODMAP) diet (RR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.70-6.26) and low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (RR: 17.79; 95% CI: 3.27-112.54) significantly relieved IBS symptoms. The control group showed significantly lower effectiveness than the probiotics group (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.32-0.69). According to the surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA), a low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (80.4%) had the best effect in relieving IBS symptoms, followed by a low-FODMAP diet (70.8%), probiotics (65.1%), and a gluten-free diet (54.3%). In reducing the total IBS-SSS, the low-FODMAP diet (90.5%) was the most effective, followed by the low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (76.6%), probiotics alone (62.3%), and gluten-free diet (28.3%). In reducing total IBS-QOL, probiotics (72.1%) ranked first, followed by gluten-free (57.0%) and low-FODMAP (56.9%) diets. Probiotics (34.9%) were associated with the lowest risk of adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: A low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics is most effective in relieving IBS symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet is the most recommended diet for alleviating IBS severity, and probiotics were associated with improving the QOL of patients with IBS, with the fewest adverse events.

35848115,Comparing Probiotic And Drug Interventions In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis Of Randomised Controlled Trials.,"Clinical decisions made by health professionals to recommend either drug or probiotic interventions for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be supported by proper knowledge of the efficacy rates of both types of interventions. In this article, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of both probiotic- and drug interventions in IBS. Medline was searched between January 2015 - January 2021. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) recruiting participants > 18 years old with IBS and examining the effect of probiotics or drugs were eligible for inclusion. The data of the primary outcome, i.e. the persistence of IBS symptoms (dichotomous symptom data), were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes, abdominal pain- and bloating scores (continuous data), were pooled using a standardised mean difference with a 95% CI. The search identified 269 citations of which 32 RCTs were eligible. Our meta-analysis indicated that both probiotic and drug interventions are able to improve the persistence of IBS symptoms (RR 0.60 [0.51; 0.92] versus 0.87 [0.81; 0.92], respectively) and abdominal pain scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35 [-0.56; -0.14] versus -0.10 [-0.20; 0.00], respectively). However, determining the overall efficacy of both intervention types is inherently complex and such results should be interpreted with care, due to the large diversity of probiotic- and drug types and doses, which is also complicated by variety in IBS subtypes. Hence, as a first step, more large scale randomised double blind placebo-controlled trials focussing on a specific IBS subtype targeted with specific probiotic strains or specific pharmaceutical modalities should be executed, enabling a more proper comparison between trials.",van der Geest AM; Schukking I; Brummer RJM; van de Burgwal LHM; Larsen OFA,2022,Beneficial microbes,13,3,183-194,10.3920/BM2021.0123,"van der Geest, A.

Mendelian randomization (MR) studies provide valuable insight into the causal relationship between an exposure and disease outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of causal inference studies that apply MR approaches to assess the role of these micronutrients, particularly VD, in COVID-19 risk, infection severity, and related inflammatory markers.
DATA SOURCES: Searches (up to July 2023) were conducted in 4 databases.
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: The quality of the studies was evaluated based on the MR-STROBE guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted where possible.
RESULTS: There were 28 studies (2 overlapped) including 12 on micronutrients (8 on VD) and COVID-19, 4 on micronutrients (all on VD) and inflammation, and 12 on inflammatory markers and COVID-19. Some of these studies reported significant causal associations between VD or other micronutrients (vitamin C, vitamin B6, iron, zinc, copper, selenium, and magnesium) and COVID-19 outcomes. Associations in terms of causality were also nonsignificant with regard to inflammation-related markers, except for VD levels below 25 nmol/L and C-reactive protein (CRP). Some studies reported causal associations between cytokines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other inflammatory markers and COVID-19. Pooled MR estimates showed that VD was not significantly associated with COVID-19 outcomes, whereas ACE2 increased COVID-19 risk (MR odds ratio = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.19) but did not affect hospitalization or severity of the disease. The methodological quality of the studies was high in 13 studies, despite the majority (n = 24) utilizing 2-sample MR and evaluated pleiotropy.
CONCLUSION: MR studies exhibited diversity in their approaches but do not support a causal link between VD/micronutrients and COVID-19 outcomes. Whether inflammation mediates the VD-COVID-19 relationship remains uncertain, and highlights the need to address this aspect in future MR studies exploring micronutrient associations with COVID-19 outcomes.

39946356,The Effect Of Acupuncture On Quality Of Life In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been used to improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients in clinical settings. However, the effect of acupuncture on QoL in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on the QoL of patients with IBS.
METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and Web of Science were screened from inception to September 2023. RCTs published in English comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, usual care, pharmacological interventions, or other therapies were analyzed for QoL in patients with IBS. The primary outcome was QoL and secondary outcomes were the IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) and abdominal pain. The Cochrane Collaboration recommendations were used to assess the risk of bias.
FINDINGS: Fourteen articles with 2,038 participants were included. The pooled result showed acupuncture can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBS compared to the conventional treatment (MD = 6.62, 95% CI, 2.30 to 10.94, P<0.001, I2 = 72.45%). Additionally, acupuncture was superior to other interventions in relieving the symptoms' severity of IBS (MD = -46.58, 95% CI, -91.49 to -1.68, P<0.001, I2 = 90.76%). Nevertheless, acupuncture was not associated with abdominal pain reduction (MD = -0.35, 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.20, P = 0.21, I2 = 0.00%). Lower adverse events were observed in the acupuncture group. Thus, the quality of this study was relatively high.
CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed that acupuncture improves QoL and symptom severity in patients with IBS and that the optimal parameters for acupuncture to improve QoL in patients with IBS are 30 minutes of acupuncture per session, less than or equal to five sessions per week, and a 4-week course of treatment.

However, clinical treatment of irritable bowel disease with vitamin D is controversial. Objective: we conducted a meta-analysis of all clinical trials to evaluate the associations between vitamin D and irritable bowel disease. Methods: we screened all randomized controlled trials that were published before December 20, 2021 from the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Central, and Clinical Trial. We used RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 16.1 to analyze the relevant data. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was used to report effect sizes. Serum vitamin D concentration, risk of vitamin D deficiency among patients with IBS, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Quality of Life (QoL) score are the main endpoint outcomes in this study. Results: data from twelve clinical trials with 1331 IBS patients were included. Patients with IBS have relatively low vitamin D levels in their serum. Vitamin D supplementation improves the Quality of Life (QoL) score but has no significant effect on the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome.

A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to determine their effectiveness for FGIDs.
METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases till July 2019 with English language restriction: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PUBMED. Randomized double-blind controlled trials of HMs compared with placebo or conventional pharmacological drugs for adult FGIDs patients were included.
RESULTS: In total, 49 trials involving 7396 participants with FGIDs were included. The risk of bias was low in 9, unclear in 36, and high in 4 trials. More than 33 different herbal formulae were tested. HMs demonstrated statistically significant benefits for symptom improvement compared with placebo in 46 trials (RR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.48-1.88). When compared with conventional pharmacological therapy in 5 trials, HMs were found to be non-inferior (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18). The number of trials with regards to FD, IBS and FC were 19, 23 and 7 respectively. Subgroup analysis found that HMs were better than placebo in alleviating symptoms for FD (RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.69), IBS (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.32-1.97) and FC (RR = 3.83, 95% CI 2.26-6.50).

A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Diverticular disease (DD) is the most frequent condition in the Western world that affects the colon. Although chronic mild inflammatory processes have recently been proposed as a central factor in DD, limited information is currently available regarding the role of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to assess the mucosal TNF-α levels in DD. We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to identify observational studies assessing the TNF-α levels in DD. Full-text articles that satisfied our inclusion and exclusion criteria were included, and a quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The principal summary outcome was the mean difference (MD). The results were reported as MD (95% confidence interval (CI)). A total of 12 articles involving 883 subjects were included in the qualitative synthesis, out of which 6 studies were included in our quantitative synthesis. We did not observe statistical significance related to the mucosal TNF-α levels in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) vs. the controls (0.517 (95% CI -1.148-2.182)), and symptomatic vs. asymptomatic DD patients (0.657 (95% CI -0.883-2.196)). However, the TNF-α levels were found to be significantly increased in DD compared to irritable bowel disease (IBS) patients (27.368 (95% CI 23.744-30.992)), and segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) vs. IBS patients (25.303 (95% CI 19.823-30.784)). Between SUDD and the controls, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic DD, there were no significant differences in the mucosal TNF-α levels. However, the TNF-α levels were considerably higher in DD and SCAD patients than IBS patients. Our findings suggest that TNF-α may play a key role in the pathogenesis of DD in specific subgroups and could potentially be a target for future therapies.",Sabo CM; Ismaiel M; Ismaiel A; Leucuta DC; Popa SL; Grad S; Dumitrascu DL,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,12,,10.3390/ijms24129934,"Sabo, C.

34755926,Oral And Parenteral Anti-Neuropathic Agents For The Management Of Pain And Discomfort In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent and economically burdensome condition; and pain is often the most unpleasant, disruptive, and difficult-to-treat symptom. Visceral hypersensitivity is a common feature driving pain in IBS, suggesting that neuropathic mechanisms may be implicated. We conducted a systematic review of available evidence to examine the role of anti-neuropathic medicines in the management of pain in IBS.
METHODS: We systematically searched scientific repositories for trials investigating conventional oral, and/or parenteral, pharmaceutical antineuropathic treatments in patients with IBS. We summarized key participant characteristics, outcomes related to pain (primary outcome), and selected secondary outcomes.
KEY RESULTS: We included 13 studies (n = 629 participants): six investigated amitriptyline, three duloxetine, three pregabalin, and one gabapentin. There was considerable methodological and statistical heterogeneity, so we performed a narrative synthesis and limited meta-analysis. Amitriptyline was most extensively studied, though only in diarrhea-predominant patients. In individual trials, amitriptyline, pregabalin and gabapentin generally appeared beneficial for pain outcomes. While duloxetine studies tended to report improvements in pain, all were un-controlled trials with high risk of bias. Meta-analysis of three studies (n = 278) yielded a pooled relative-risk of 0.50 (95%CI 0.38-0.66) for not improving with anti-neuropathic agent vs control. We did not identify any eligible studies investigating the role of parenteral anti-neuropathics.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Anti-neuropathic analgesics may improve pain in IBS, and deserve further, high-quality investigation, potentially considering parenteral administration and agents with minimal gastrointestinal motility effects. Investigation of amitriptyline's efficacy in non-diarrhea-predominant subtypes is currently lacking, and we recommend particular caution for its use in IBS-C.",Lambarth A; Zarate-Lopez N; Fayaz A,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,1,e14289,10.1111/nmo.14289,"Lambarth, A., Zarate-Lopez, N., & Fayaz, A.

39917138,"The Efficacy Of The Low-Fodmap (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols) Diet In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently observed in clinical practice and affects people from different parts of the world. The pathogenesis and aetiology are not well-defined or fully understood; however, altered bowel movements, psychological factors, and visceral hypersensitivity may contribute to symptoms via a pathway mediated by serotonin and other enteric neurotransmitters. Altered bowel movements, including diarrhoea and constipation, abdominal pain relieved by passing flatus, and bloating are the main salient features of this condition. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness and efficacy of a low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (low-FODMAP) diet in these patients. Systematic searches were conducted on PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic trials and cohort studies that included keywords about IBS and a low-FODMAP diet were included. Exclusion criteria included studies that were not in the English language, not relevant to IBS, diet-related to inflammatory bowel disease, or not pertinent to the subject. A total of 41 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. There was significant heterogeneity among the RCTs; hence, a random-effects model was used. The systematic review included a total of 8460 patients across 36 studies, with follow-up durations ranging from 11 to 16 months. Specifically, the meta-analysis included 15 RCTs with 1118 participants and follow-up durations from two days to nine weeks and six cohort studies including 292 patients with follow-up durations from two weeks to two years. The risk ratio (RR) was 1.21 (95% confidence interval= 0.98-1.51), and the I2 value ​​​​​was 63% for global symptom improvement with a low-FODMAP diet using a random-effects model. There was a low risk of bias in the RCTs. Five studies were included evaluating the effect of a low-FODMAP diet on quality of life, and these studies did not show any statistically significant benefit of a low-FODMAP diet on quality of life, although a mean difference of 4.59 (95% CI 1.50-7.67) was observed. The risk of bias was moderate to severe in the observational studies included in this review. Food intolerance is increasingly recognised as a contributory factor in IBS, and its role in the pathogenesis and precipitation of symptoms is being explored. Specific mechanisms include the fermentation of FODMAPs by the gut microbiota, leading to gas production and subsequent symptoms.",Khan Z; Muhammad SA; Amin MS; Gul A,2025,Cureus,17,1,e77053,10.7759/cureus.77053,"Khan, Z., Muhammad, S.

40511506,Is There A Bidirectional Relationship Between Allergic Rhinitis And Irritable Bowel Syndrome? A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest a link between allergic rhinitis (AR) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but evidence is insufficient. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between AR and IBS.
METHODS: We searched the relevant literature in six electronic databases. We included a total of nine articles, seven of which took AR as the research object, two of which took IBS as the research object. We performed a meta-analysis using random effects and estimated the resultant odds ratio (OR).
RESULTS: A total of 10 627 patients with AR were included in seven studies, including 956 patients diagnosed with AR in the IBS population and 9671 patients diagnosed with AR in the non-IBS population. By heterogeneity test, X2 = 10.12, F-statistic (F) = 6, P = 0.12, I2 = 41%, OR = 2.88, and Z-score (Z) = 21.97 (P < 0.00001), the results were statistically significant. Patients with AR have an increased risk of developing IBS compared to patients without AR. A total of 1099 patients with IBS were included in two studies, including 384 patients with IBS in AR patients and 715 patients with IBS in the healthy population. After the heterogeneity test, X2 = 0.11, F = 1, P = 0.74, I2 = 0%, OR = 2.15, and Z = 11.81 (P < 0.00001), the results were statistically significant. Patients with IBS have an increased risk of developing AR compared to patients without IBS.
CONCLUSIONS: The bidirectional association between AR and IBS provides a basis for exploring potential new mechanisms between the two.

39128123,Functional Bowel Disorder Management In Routine Practice With Tips For Hot Topics: Expert Opinion Review.,"Functional gastrointestinal system disorders are common problems in practice. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and a mixture of these, and similar symptoms can be seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and celiac disease depending on the age of the patient, indicating the importance of differential diagnosis. The importance of patient management is shown by making a symptom-based diagnosis and making cost-effective, that is, limited advanced examinations. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is multifactorial, and stress is one of the leading triggers of IBS symptoms. Therefore, terminology will change to gut-brain interaction disorders in the future, and the patient-physician relationship has a special place in the treatment of functional bowel disorder. Dietary recommendation and medical treatment in IBS should be determined according to the predominant symptom and symptom severity. In addition to diet, some lifestyle changes can also be helpful in reducing IBS symptoms. Antispasmodics and antidepressants are not fast-acting. These drugs should be used for at least 2-4 weeks to see the efficacy of treatment.

36036990,Safety Of Intraoperative Blood Salvage During Liver Transplantation In Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) on time to tumor recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver transplantation were assessed to evaluate the safety of IBS.
BACKGROUND: IBS is highly effective to reduce the use of allogeneic blood transfusion. However, the safety of IBS during liver transplantation for patients with HCC is questioned due to fear of disseminating malignant cells.
METHODS: Comprehensive searches through June 2021 were performed in 8 databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Robins-I tool. Meta-analysis with the generic inverse variance method was performed to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for disease-free survival, HCC recurrence and overall survival.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included (n=1997, IBS n=1200, no-IBS n=797). Use of IBS during liver transplantation was not associated with impaired disease-free survival [HR=0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.66-1.24, P=0.53, IBS n=394, no-IBS n=329], not associated with increased HCC recurrence (HR=0.83, 95% CI=0.57-1.23, P=0.36, IBS n=537, no-IBS n=382) and not associated with impaired overall survival (HR=1.04, 95% CI=0.79-1.37, P=0.76, IBS n=495, no-IBS n=356).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on available observational data, use of IBS during liver transplantation in patients with HCC does not result in impaired disease-free survival, increased HCC recurrence or impaired overall survival.

31284829,Psychological Factors Related To Time To Help-Seeking For Cancer Symptoms: A Meta-Analysis Across Cancer Sites.,"The time patients wait before seeking help for cancer symptoms is among the most important factors contributing to diagnostic delays in cancer. We reviewed the association between time to help-seeking and three psychological factors: symptom knowledge, symptom interpretation, and beliefs about cancer. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, providing data from 22 countries concerning seven cancer sites. Better symptom knowledge was related to lower odds of a long help-seeking interval in both studies with healthy populations (OR = .73, 95% CI [.63, .84], k = 19) and patients (OR = .40, 95% CI [.23, .69], k = 12), and so was interpreting experienced symptoms as cancer-related (OR = .52, 95% CI [.36, .75], k = 13 studies with patients). More positive beliefs about cancer (i.e., that cancer is treatable) were associated with lower odds of a long help-seeking interval in both studies with healthy populations (OR = .70, 95% CI [.52, .92], k = 11) and with patients (OR = .51, 95% CI [.32, .82], k = 7).

35662700,An Overview Of Systematic Reviews Of Herbal Medicine For Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder with abdominal pain and bowel habits changes. Herbal medicines (HMs) are frequently used in the treatment of IBS. Therefore, several systematic reviews (SRs) have been conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of HM in IBS patients. This study aimed to investigate the methodology and quality of evidence of SRs, and to describe the current state of research and evidence for the treatment of IBS with HM. Methods: SRs published up to January 2022 were searched using six electronic databases. SRs and/or meta-analyses on the use of HMs for IBS were included. The effects of placebo, conventional medicine (CM), and probiotics were compared with those of HMs. Two investigators independently extracted the data and assessed methodological quality using the Measure Tool to Assessment System Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for each main finding. Results: Eighteen SRs were included in this overview. Among them, eight SRs reported only specific subtypes of IBS: six SRs reported patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, and two SRs reported patients with constipation-predominant IBS. In terms of total efficacy, HM was more effective than placebo, CM, or probiotics. HM showed a more significant effect than CM in relieving independent IBS symptom score (abdominal pain score, diarrhea score, abdominal distension score, stool frequency score, etc.) and recurrence rate. The rate of adverse events was significantly lower with HM compared to CM, and no serious adverse events were reported with HM treatment. According to AMSTAR 2, the methodological quality of the included SRs was extremely low. Furthermore, the quality of evidence for total efficacy was considered low or very low according to the GRADE tool. Conclusion: HM can be considered as an effective and safe treatment for IBS. However, the methodological quality of the included SRs and the quality of evidence was generally low. Therefore, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed in the future so that a high-quality SR can be used to better assess the safety and efficacy of HM in the treatment of IBS.

37031468,Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In The Treatment Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Randomised Clinical Trials Using Rome Iv Criteria.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which affects a great number of patients globally. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have evaluated different therapies for IBS. Some of them have shown that probiotics play a significant role in the management of IBS-patients. Nevertheless, results are controversial, and the efficacy of the administration of probiotics remains to be confirmed, especially in regard to which type of probiotic-strains are beneficial.
AIM: The aim of the present meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of the administration of probiotics to IBS-patients with a diagnosis based on Rome IV criteria, which is performed for the first time.
METHODS: Electronic databases (Pubmed, Scopus and Cochrane) were searched until 26.01.2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the administration of probiotics in adult IBS-patients, who were categorized according to the Rome IV criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (ROB) 2.0. Weighted and standardized mean difference with the 95% confidence intervals were used for the synthesis of the results. Primary outcomes were the decrease of IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and decrease of abdominal pain. The secondary outcomes were the improvement in quality of life (QoL) and the decrease of bloating. Lastly, the adverse effects of probiotics were evaluated. The protocol of the study has been registered at protocols.io (DOI dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn218yg5d/v1).
RESULTS: Six double-blind (N = 970) placebo-control RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria and overall, nine different strains of probiotics were examined. No significant reduction in IBS-SSS (WMD -43.2, 95% CI -87.5 to 1.0, I2 = 82.9%) was demonstrated, whereas a significant decrease regarding abdominal pain (SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.35, I2 = 92,2) was shown. Furthermore, no correlation between improvement of QoL and the use of probiotics (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.00, I2 = 93,9%) was shown. However, probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in bloating (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.09, I2 = 36,0%). A qualitative synthesis was conducted about adverse events and showed that the use of probiotics' is safe without severe adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of probiotics to IBS-patients demonstrated a positive effect on pain and bloating, but due to significant heterogeneity and confounding factors, that were not examined in the included studies, a definitive statement cannot be made. Moreover, probiotics did not lead to an improvement in other parameters. There is a need for larger RCTs in IBS-patients diagnosed according to Rome IV (not III) criteria and especially it is essential to be conducted RCTs which examine the administration of specific strains and have similar methodological characteristics.",Konstantis G; Efstathiou S; Pourzitaki C; Kitsikidou E; Germanidis G; Chourdakis M,2023,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",42,5,800-809,10.1016/j.clnu.2023.03.019,"Konstantis, G., Efstathiou, S., Pourzitaki, C., Kitsikidou, E., Germanidis, G., & Chourdakis, M.

We sought to assess the comparative efficacy of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE) vs high definition white light endoscopy (HDWLE) or dye-spraying chromoendoscopy (DCE) through a meta-analysis and rating the quality of evidence.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed through February 15, 2019. Primary outcomes were number of patients in whom dysplasia was identified and number of dysplastic lesions identified in these patients. We included only randomized control trials (RCTs) and performed meta-analysis using RevMan5.3.
RESULTS: Of the 3205 studies identified, 11 RCTs were included, with a total of 1328 patients. Per patient analysis, VCE was not statistically different compared with DCE (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.55-1.08) or HDWLE (RR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.45-1.15). However, per dysplasia analysis, VCE was not statistically different compared with DCE (RR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.47-1.11) and inferior compared with HDWLE (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.88). The quality of evidence was moderate in the HDWLE and low to moderate in the DCE studies.
CONCLUSION: Based on this meta-analysis, VCE was as good as HDWLE and DCE in identifying dysplasia per patient analysis. However, per dysplasia analysis, VCE was inferior compared with HDWLE and no different from DCE. Further studies need to examine the efficacy of each individual VCE technique.",El-Dallal M; Chen Y; Lin Q; Rakowsky S; Sattler L; Foromera J; Grossberg L; Cheifetz AS; Feuerstein JD,2020,Inflammatory bowel diseases,26,9,1319-1329,10.1093/ibd/izaa011,"El-Dallal, M., Chen, Y., Lin, Q., Rakowsky, S., Sattler, L., Foromera, J., Grossberg, L., Cheifetz, A.

39669195,Herbal Placebo Response In Clinical Trials On Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To systematically evaluate the herbal placebo response in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicine on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for RCTs with herbal placebo groups for IBS in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Wan Fang database and Sinomed database from 31 January 1994 to November 2023, and the quality of the literature was evaluated by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment criteria. The primary outcome indicators were response rate, abdominal pain and stool improvement rate, which were analyzed by single-group rate meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes were analyzed in subgroups based on diagnostic criteria, duration of treatment, subtype, research locations, placebo form, and presence of herbal ingredients to look for factors affecting respond rate.
RESULTS: The study included 24 papers, involving a total of 2,596 patients. Of these, 1151 IBS patients were treated with the herbal placebo. The placebo response rate in IBS patients in the herbal placebo group was 37% (P < 0.01,I2 = 75%). A total of 287 patients in five studies were given the herbal placebo, and the improvement rate of abdominal pain was 29% (P = 0.83, I2 = 0%). Four studies enrolled a total of 212 patients with IBS who received herbal placebo, and the stool improvement rate was 46% (P = 0.02 < 0.05, I2 = 71%). The research locations and treatment duration were sources of heterogeneity (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There is a significant herbal placebo response in patients with IBS. Different research locations and treatment durations are major sources of heterogeneity that may affect IBS patient response rates. The addition of a low dose of herbal ingredients when simulating an herbal placebo does not exaggerate the therapeutic effect of the placebo. There is a lack of uniformity and standardization in the preparation and evaluation of herbal placebos.",Huang K; Lv M; Zheng T; Wang F; Tang X; Lv L,2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,15,,1475366,10.3389/fphar.2024.1475366,"Huang, K., Lv, M., Zheng, T., Wang, F., Tang, X., & Lv, L.

39200318,"Oral Health And ""Modern"" Digestive Diseases: Pathophysiologic And Etiologic Factors.","In the contemporary era of medicine, exploring the complexity of the human body and its intricate interactions has become a central concern for health researchers. The main purpose of this article is to summarize the current understanding of relevant pathophysiological factors such as chronic inflammation, dysbiosis (microbial imbalance), and metabolic disorders, as well as etiological factors including dietary habits, lifestyle choices, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and genetic predispositions, as well as to emphasize potential avenues for upcoming studies and their medical significance. Additionally, this article aims to assess the potential impact of integrated treatment approaches on patient outcomes, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, dentists, and other healthcare professionals to develop comprehensive care plans that address both oral and digestive health issues simultaneously. Among the branches with a significant impact on general well-being are oral cavity health and digestive diseases, which have been the subject of intensive research in recent decades. In this context, analysis of the current state of knowledge on oral cavity disorders in relation to ""modern"" digestive diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) becomes essential for a deeper understanding of the interconnections between oral and digestive health. The temporal overlap or succession, whether preceding or following, of oral manifestations and digestive disorders should be taken seriously by both gastroenterologists and dentists to facilitate early diagnosis and explain to patients the correlation between these two body systems. In summary, this article underscores the importance of understanding the intricate relationship between oral and digestive health, advocating for interdisciplinary approaches to improve patient outcomes and guide future research.",Rotaru M; Singeap AM; Ciobica A; Huiban L; Stanciu C; Romila L; Burlui V; Mavroudis I; Trifan A,2024,Biomedicines,12,8,,10.3390/biomedicines12081854,"Rotaru, M., Singeap, A.

37569265,Prognostic And Clinicopathological Significance Of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (Egfr) Expression In Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the current evidence in relation to the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published before November 2022. We evaluated the quality of primary-level studies using the QUIPS tool, conducted meta-analyses, examined inter-study heterogeneity via subgroup analyses and meta-regressions, and performed small-study effects analyses. Fifty primary-level studies (4631 patients) met the inclusion criteria. EGFR overexpression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.38, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.06-1.79, p = 0.02), N+ status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.01-1.86, p = 0.04), and moderately-poorly differentiated OSCC (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.05-1.94, p = 0.02). In addition, better results were obtained by the application of a cutoff point ≥10% tumor cells with EGFR overexpression (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis supports that the immunohistochemical assessment of EGFR overexpression may be useful as a prognostic biomarker for OSCC.",Cívico-Ortega JL; González-Ruiz I; Ramos-García P; Cruz-Granados D; Samayoa-Descamps V; González-Moles MÁ,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,15,,10.3390/ijms241511888,"Cívico-Ortega, J.

35728042,Effects Of A Low Fodmap Diet On The Colonic Microbiome In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet is increasingly used to manage symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although this approach may alter the colonic microbiome, the nature of these changes has not been comprehensively synthesized.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the impact of a low FODMAP diet on the composition and function of the microbiome in patients with IBS.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of a low FODMAP diet on the colonic microbiome in patients with IBS in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science from inception to April 2022. Outcomes included diversity of the microbiome, specific bacterial abundances, fecal SCFA concentration, and fecal pH. For fecal SCFA concentrations and pH, meta-analyses were performed via a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Nine trials involving 403 patients were included. There were no clear effects of the low FODMAP diet on diversity of the microbiome. A low FODMAP diet consistently led to lower abundance of Bifidobacteria, but there were no clear effects on diversity of the microbiome or abundances of other specific taxa. There were no differences in total fecal SCFA concentration between the low FODMAP diet and control diets (standardized mean difference: -0.25; 95% CI: -0.63, 0.13; P = 0.20), nor were there differences for fecal concentrations of specific SCFAs or fecal pH.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS, the effects of a low FODMAP diet on the colonic microbiome appear to be specific to Bifidobacteria with no consistent impacts on other microbiome metrics, including diversity, fecal SCFA concentrations, and fecal pH. Further, adequately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings.This review was registered at https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ as CRD42020192243.",So D; Loughman A; Staudacher HM,2022,The American journal of clinical nutrition,116,4,943-952,10.1093/ajcn/nqac176,"So, D., Loughman, A., & Staudacher, H.

32387213,The Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics For Patients With Constipation-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Based On Seventeen Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND: & Objectives: Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is functional bowel disorders that may involve disturbance of the gastrointestinal microbiota. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with IBS-C.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases up to 1 May 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with IBS-C that compared probiotics to placebo or no therapy were eligible for the analysis. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to calculate the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of remaining symptoms after therapy. Continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference (MD) with the 95% CI. Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. The analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.2.
RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs involving 1469 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, probiotics significantly increased stool frequency by 1.29 bowel movements (BM)/wk (95% CI: 0.69 to 1.89 BM/wk; P < 0.0001), and improved stool consistency (SMD: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.82; P = 0.0001). Compared with placebo, patients using probiotics experienced a shorter gut transit time by 12.36 h (95% CI: -20.74 to -3.98 h; P = 0.004). No serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally, probiotics may be safe and may improve whole gut transit time, stool frequency, and stool consistency. However, adequately powered RCTs are required to better determine the species or strains, doses, and duration of use of probiotics that are most efficacious. Further research and evidence is required before probiotics is adopted as one of treatments of IBS-C.",Wen Y; Li J; Long Q; Yue CC; He B; Tang XG,2020,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",79,,111-119,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.063,"Wen, Y., Li, J., Long, Q., Yue, C.

37436005,Safety And Efficacy Of Personalized Versus Standard Initial Dosing Of Thiopurines: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Trials.,"BACKGROUND: Pretherapy assessment of specific genetic polymorphism (TPMT, NUDT15, FTO, RUNX1, etc) or enzyme levels (for TPMT) may help personalize the dose of thiopurines and avoid adverse effects.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing personalized versus standard strategy for initial thiopurine dosing was performed. The electronic databases were searched on 27 September 2022. The outcomes were overall adverse effects, myelotoxicity, drug interruptions, and therapeutic efficacy with either strategy. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE methodology.
RESULTS: We included six randomized trials, done dominantly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The personalized strategies were genotype testing in 4 trials (TPMT in three trials, NUDT15 in two) and enzyme levels for TPMT in two trials. The pooled risk of myelotoxicity in personalized dosing was lower [RR = 0.72 (95%CI, 0.55-0.94, I2 = 0%)]. The pooled risk of pancreatitis (RR = 1.10I, 0.78-1.56, I2 = 0%), hepatotoxicity (RR = 1.13, 0.69-1.88, I2 = 45), and GI intolerance (RR = 1.01, 0.92-1.10, I2 = 0) were similar in two groups. The pooled risk of drug interruption in individualized dosing was similar to the standard dosing group (RR = 0.97, I2 = 68%).

36502789,"Menthacarin, A Proprietary Peppermint Oil And Caraway Oil Combination, Improves Multiple Complaints In Patients With Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","INTRODUCTION: This systematic review summarizes published data on Menthacarin, the proprietary combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil, in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Efficacy was assessed by meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the manufacturer's information system for clinical studies investigating the safety and efficacy of Menthacarin. Efficacy analyses included change from baseline of epigastric pain and general improvement of the patients' condition.
RESULTS: Five randomized trials involving 580 patients were found, demonstrating significant effects of Menthacarin on symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) compared to placebo or similar effects compared to a reference drug. Seven other studies reported favorable results on therapeutic application in FD patients with concomitant Helicobacter pylori infection, in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and on tolerability in FD patients from 12 years of age. Three trials in FD with 249 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in pain intensity (standardized mean difference: 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-1.21) and in item 2 of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (risk ratio: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.81-3.87) for Menthacarin.

40431349,Moderate Wine Consumption And Gastrointestinal Diseases.,"By conducting a narrative review of the scientific literature, the authors of this study sought to verify whether there were sufficient data to answer the following question: ""Can wine positively or negatively influence the incidence and severity of disorders associated with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases?"". In this review, most of the studies considered tested different alcoholic beverages (other than wine), not always reporting in the conclusions the possible difference in the extent of symptoms. Although alcohol certainly plays a central role in influencing the oesophageal and gastric environment, no studies evaluating the role of alcohol as such were included, since the aim of the review was to understand whether wine can be moderately consumed by patients with gastrointestinal diseases. The analysis of studies selected from the main reference databases indicates that even moderate wine consumption can be a source of discomfort in subjects with the GI diseases included in this review (gastritis and gastroesophageal disease, gastrointestinal motility, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and microscopic colitis). This does not mean that a certain percentage of patients cannot tolerate moderate amounts of alcoholic beverages; however, discussion with the family doctor or specialist is essential to identify the correct diet in which to include or exclude the consumption of wine. One of the limitations of this review is the low number of studies available, at least for some of the pathologies considered. It is important to emphasise, however, that some selected epidemiological studies, which include many subjects (even over 100,000), can provide useful information from a scientific point of view.",Restani P; Di Lorenzo C; Antoce AO; Araujo M; Bani C; Mercogliano F; Ruf JC; Kosti RI; Teissedre PL,2025,Nutrients,17,10,,10.3390/nu17101608,"Restani, P., Di Lorenzo, C., Antoce, A.

35091134,Significance Of P53 Overexpression In The Prediction Of The Malignant Transformation Risk Of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the current evidence in relation to the predictive value of p53 overexpression as a biomarker of the malignant transformation risk in oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus for studies published before July-2021, not restricted by date or publication language, with longitudinal design and assessing p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the quality of primary-level studies using QUIPS tool. We carried out meta-analyses, examined inter-study heterogeneity through subgroup and meta-regression analyses, and performed sensitivity and small-study effects analyses to test the stability and reliability of results.
RESULTS: Twenty four studies (1,210 patients) met inclusion criteria. P53 overexpression was associated with a statistically significant about 2 fold risk (RR = 1.88, 95 %CI = 1.39-2.56, p < 0.001). Leukoplakia maintained this significant relationship after subgroup meta-analysis (p = 0.002). Regarding the immunohistochemical technique, better results were obtained by the subgroups using anti-p53 DO7 antibody (p = 0.001), at high concentration (dilution < 1: 100, p < 0.001), incubated for long periods (overnight, p = 0.02), and at low temperature (4 °C, p = 0.007). Furthermore, meta-regression analysis showed that the association between p53 overexpression and higher oral cancer risk was independent of the presence and/or severity of epithelial dysplasia (p > 0.05).

34684663,Vitamin D Supplementation And Mental Health In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases And Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with decreased quality of life and mental health problems. Among various approaches to supportive therapy that aims to improve mental health in affected individuals, vitamin D supplementation is considered to be an effective method which may also be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms during the course of IBDs and IBS. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in adults with inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, including IBDs and IBS. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included. The human studies eligible to be included in the review should have described any intervention involving vitamin D as a supplement in a group of adult patients suffering from IBDs and/or IBS and should have assessed any component of mental health, but studies presenting the effects of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After eliminating the duplicates, a total of 8514 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers. Further evaluation was carried out on the basis of title, abstract, and full text. Finally, 10 studies (four for IBDs and six for IBS) were selected for the current systematic review, and their quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The studies analyzed the influence of various doses of vitamin D on bowel diseases, compared the results of vitamin D supplementation with placebo, or administered specific doses of vitamin D to obtain the required level in the blood. Supplementation was performed for at least 6 weeks. The analyzed mental health outcomes mainly included disease-specific quality of life/quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The majority of studies (including high-quality ones) confirmed the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, which was proven by all research works evaluating anxiety and depression and by the majority of research works evaluating quality of life. Although the studies followed different dosage regimens and supplementation protocols, the positive influence of vitamin D on mental health was found to be consistent. The number of studies on patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and the availability of trials randomized against the placebo group was low in the current review, which is considered to be a limitation of the present study and could also reflect the final outcome of the analysis. The conducted systematic review established the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, but this result requires further investigation, particularly in relation to other mental health outcomes.",Głąbska D; Kołota A; Lachowicz K; Skolmowska D; Stachoń M; Guzek D,2021,Nutrients,13,10,,10.3390/nu13103662,"Głąbska, D., Kołota, A., Lachowicz, K., Skolmowska, D., Stachoń, M., & Guzek, D.

39057399,Fucoidan As A Promising Drug For Pain Treatment: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Fucoidan is a polymer of L-fucose and L-fucose-4-sulphate naturally found in marine sources that inhibits p-selectin, preventing neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury. Fucoidan is employed in many studies as a tool to investigate the contribution of neutrophils to pain, showing analgesic effects. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the analgesic effects of pretreatment with fucoidan reported in the available preclinical studies. In addition, we summarized the articles which have studied the therapeutic effects of fucoidan in pathological pain at preclinical and clinical levels. The results of this systematic review reveal that pretreatment with fucoidan is a powerful tool which reduces neutrophil infiltration by 70-90% at early time points. This meta-analysis showed that preventative treatment with fucoidan produced a significant pain reduction. In addition, several preclinical studies have observed that fucoidan treatment reduces the pain that is associated with various pathologies. Finally, fucoidan has also been tested in several clinical trials, with some degree of analgesic efficacy, but they were mostly small pilot studies. Considering all the above information, it can be concluded that fucoidan is not only a preclinical tool for studying the role of neutrophils in pain but also a promising therapeutic strategy for pain treatment.",Huerta MÁ; Tejada MÁ; Nieto FR,2024,Marine drugs,22,7,,10.3390/md22070290,"Huerta, M.

35308554,Risk Of Colorectal Cancer In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis Of Population-Based Observational Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence on the association between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether IBS leads to an increased risk for CRC using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched to identify all relevant literature published through July 30, 2021. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC after diagnosis of IBS were computed using random-and fixed-effects models and stratified by age, follow-up time, gender, and study design. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: We included six studies consisting of 1,085,024 participants. Overall, the risk of detecting CRC after the initial IBS diagnosis was significantly higher than non-IBS controls (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04-2.22, P = 0.032). The peak of elevated risk occurred within the first year of IBS diagnosis (RR = 6.84, 95% CI: 3.70-12.65, P < 0.001), and after 1 year, the risk of CRC was similar to that of the general population (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88-1.18, P = 0.813). Notably, we found that the RR of CRC was more significant in IBS patients younger than 50 years compared to those older than 50 years (RR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.17-3.53, P = 0.012 vs. 1.28, 95%CI: 0.94-1.75, P = 0.118, respectively). Gender and study design did not affect the results.
CONCLUSION: The risk of CRC within one year of the initial IBS diagnosis was increased approximately six-fold, whereas the long-term risk was not increased. However, current evidence does not support that IBS leads to an increased incidence of CRC, and the early excess risk is more likely attributable to misclassification resulting from overlapping symptoms rather than causation. Clinicians must remain vigilant for the CRC risk in patients younger than 50 years with IBS-like symptoms to avoid delaying necessary screening.",Wu X; Wang J; Ye Z; Wang J; Liao X; Liv M; Svn Z,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,819122,10.3389/fmed.2022.819122,"Wu, X., Wang, J., Ye, Z., Wang, J., Liao, X., Liv, M., & Svn, Z.

BACKGROUND: There is limited composite data on the outcomes of ESD for RTDLs versus non-RTDLs.
STUDY: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported the clinical outcomes of ESD for RTDLs and non-RTDLs. Main outcomes were pooled estimated rates of en bloc/complete/curative resection, local recurrence, and incidence of bleeding, perforation, stricture, anal pain, and fever.
RESULTS: Six studies were enrolled, including 265 cases of RTDLs and 788 cases of non-RTDLs. The en bloc resection rate was comparable for RTDLs and non-RTDLs [odds ratio (OR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-1.95; P=0.90]. The complete resection rate was significantly lower for RTDLs (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.83; P=0.003), as well as the curative resection rate (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.87; P=0.010). The rates of stricture, postoperative anal pain and local recurrence were significantly higher for RTDLs than non-RTDLs (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.01-9.31; P=0.05) (OR, 42.10; 95% CI, 4.73-374.97; P=0.0008) (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.13-7.96; P=0.03), but the higher rates of postoperative bleeding and fever for RTDLs were not significantly (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.53-3.30; P=0.54) (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 0.55-9.07; P=0.26), as well as its lower perforation rate (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.27-2.63; P=0.78).

36277191,Acupuncture Vs. Antispasmodics In The Treatment Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Adjusted Indirect Treatment Comparison Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Acupuncture has been extensively applied to manage irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in clinical practice in China. Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated their efficacy, but it has rarely been compared with first-line antispasmodics to verify their effectiveness. Therefore, we compare acupuncture with antispasmodics in the treatment of IBS by using an adjusted indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis. Methods: Embase, OVID Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to 14 March 2022, with no language restrictions. RCTs comparing antispasmodics or acupuncture with placebo or one of the antispasmodics were enrolled. The primary outcome of interest was the improvement of abdominal pain. And the secondary outcomes of interest were the relief of global IBS symptoms and adverse events. The random-effects model was utilized to pool data. The effect size was measured by standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative ratio, and the effectiveness of acupuncture and different antispasmodics were ranked by P-scores. Results: Thirty-five RCTs (n = 5,190) were included. The analysis showed that cimetropium, drotaverine, acupuncture, and pinarverium were superior over placebo in relieving abdominal pain; cimetropium (SMD, -3.00 [95%CI, -4.47 to -1.53], P-score = 0.99) ranked the most effective. In pairwise comparisons, acupuncture had a greater improvement than most antispasmodics except cimetropium and drotaverine in relieving abdominal pain, although the between-group difference was statistically insignificant. In the analysis of continuous outcome in the relief of global IBS symptoms, the result showed that pinaverium was more effective (SMD, 1.72 [95%CI, 0.53 to 2.92], P-score = 0.90) than placebo. Trimebutine and acupuncture had greater improvements than placebo, but no significant difference was shown between groups. In pairwise comparisons, acupuncture was more effective than pinaverium (SMD, -1.11 [95%CI, -1.94 to -0.28]) in relieving global IBS symptoms. In the analysis of adverse events, acupuncture had a lower adverse event rate than most of the other antispasmodics. Conclusion: Cimetropium, drotaverine, and acupuncture were all better than placebo in improving abdominal pain. Acupuncture was preferred over pinaverium in relieving global IBS symptoms, and acupuncture had lower adverse events than most antispasmodics.",Shi YZ; Tao QF; Qin D; Chen M; Yu SG; Zheng H,2022,Frontiers in physiology,13,,1001978,10.3389/fphys.2022.1001978,"Shi, Y.

38047738,The Incidence And Predisposing Factors For Irritable Bowel Syndrome Following Covid-19: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Several studies have analyzed the long-term GI symptoms and IBS following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence and predisposing factors for IBS following COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Primary outcomes were the pooled incidence rate of IBS following COVID-19 and the pooled relative risk (RR) for IBS in the COVID-19 group compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Secondary outcomes were the pooled RR and the standardized mean difference (SMD) for predisposing factors in the IBS group compared to the non-IBS group. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this study. The pooled incidence rate of IBS in COVID-19 patients was 12%. The pooled incidence rate of IBS-D, IBS-C and IBS-M was 5%, 2% and 1%. The pooled incidence rate of IBS in 6 and 12 months was 10% and 3%. The pooled RR for IBS in COVID-19 patients was 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-3.01] compared to non-COVID-19 patients. The pooled RR or SMD for mild, moderate, and severe disease activity, procalcitonin (PCT), depression or anxiety in IBS patients following COVID-19 was 0.94 (95% CI = 0.74-1.21), 1.19 (95% CI = 0.65-2.21), 1.30 (95% CI = 0.63-2.66), 6.73 (95% CI = 6.08-7.38) and 3.21 (95% CI = 1.79-5.75).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of IBS following COVID-19 was 12%. But it was not higher than the general population. We also found some predisposing factors for IBS including depression or anxiety, PCT.",Wang YN; Zhou LY; Huang YH; Jiang M; Dai C,2024,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,36,2,168-176,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002688,"Wang, Y.

39110917,Nutritional Interventions In Adult Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: An Umbrella Review Of Systematic Reviews And Meta-Analyses Of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"CONTEXT: There is still debate regarding the effect of nutritional interventions in improving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine the evidence certainty and validity of all existing meta-analyses of intervention trials on nutritional interventions in patients with IBS.
DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science were reviewed until June 2023.
DATA EXTRACTION: Meta-analyses assessing the impacts of nutritional interventions in adults with IBS were entered. Effect sizes of nutritional interventions were recalculated by applying a random-effects model. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was implemented to determine evidence certainty.
RESULTS: A total of 175 trials in 58 meta-analyses were entered describing the effects of 11 nutritional interventions on IBS-related outcomes. Nutritional interventions had beneficial effects on some IBS-related outcomes. For instance, soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and aloe vera improved IBS symptoms, and vitamin D3 and curcumin improved IBS symptom severity. Tongxieyaofang improved abdominal pain severity and stool frequency. Nevertheless, these outcomes have mainly shown small effects and low to very low evidence certainty. With regard to abdominal pain after probiotic supplementation (relative risk [RR]: 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.36, 6.92; GRADE = moderate) and IBS symptoms after a low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet (RR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.93; GRADE = moderate), there was evidence that probiotics and a low-FODMAP diet can confer clinical and favorable effects.
CONCLUSION: The current review does not support nutritional interventions for improving IBS symptoms. With regard to probiotics and a low-FODMAP diet, considering limitations like short-term study duration, there was an influential clinical impact.

40735813,Impacts Of The Long-Term Low-Fodmap Diet In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) is the primary intervention for managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, due to its restrictive nature, concerns have been raised about its safety and efficacy with long-term use. This study aims to investigate the outcomes of long-term LFD (LLFD) in patients with IBS.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to November 2024. LLFD was defined as LFD for at least 6 months. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. The protocol of the study was registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42024609338).
RESULTS: Of the total 2724 screened records, five studies finally met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study (324 patients). LLFD was able to reduce overall gastrointestinal symptoms (SMD -1.97, 95% CI -3.63 to -0.30), anxiety (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.15) and depression (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.53, to -0.03). Additionally, LLFD improved quality of life (mean difference 0.53, 95% CI 0.24-0.83). However, it was not able to improve the quality of sleep (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term use of LFD appears effective in improving gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological well-being, and quality of life in patients with IBS. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore additional long-term outcomes.",Pouladi A; Arabpour E; Bahrami O; Sadeghi A; Mozafari Komesh Tape P; Abdehagh M; Zali MR,2025,Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,38,4,e70105,10.1111/jhn.70105,"Pouladi, A., Arabpour, E., Bahrami, O., Sadeghi, A., Mozafari Komesh Tape, P., Abdehagh, M., & Zali, M.

34425274,Placebo Response Rates In Trials Of Licensed Drugs For Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Constipation Or Diarrhea: Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are several licensed drugs for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but placebo response rates are high. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of licensed drugs to estimate magnitude of placebo response rate according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoints and to assess how this varies with stringency of the endpoint used to define response.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC and EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (through January 2021) to identify RCTs comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adult IBS patients. Studies assessed efficacy according to at least one of composite response, abdominal pain response, or stool response. Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, with dropouts assumed to be treatment failures and pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: There were 17 RCTs of licensed drugs versus placebo in IBS with constipation (4603 patients placebo) and 17 trials in IBS with diarrhea (3908 patients placebo). In IBS with constipation, according to FDA criteria, pooled composite, abdominal pain, and stool response rates with placebo over ≥6 of 12 weeks were 18.9%, 34.6%, and 30.1%, respectively. Evaluating response rates over ≥9 of 12 weeks led to placebo response rates of 4.3% for the composite endpoint, 24.5% for abdominal pain, and 7.7% for stool. In IBS with diarrhea, pooled placebo response rates according to FDA criteria were 16.2% for the composite endpoint, 40.2% for abdominal pain, and 16.2% for stool. Increasing the threshold used to define abdominal pain response from ≥30% improvement to ≥40% or ≥50% led to lower placebo response rates of 34.5% and 23.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Future RCTs should adhere to current FDA-recommended endpoints for IBS because these lead to lower placebo response rates. However, consideration should be given to further refining some of these to better differentiate between active drug and placebo.",Barberio B; Savarino EV; Black CJ; Ford AC,2022,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,20,5,e923-e944,10.1016/j.cgh.2021.08.025,"Barberio, B., Savarino, E.

32009472,"Comparative Of The Effectiveness And Safety Of Biological Agents, Tofacitinib, And Fecal Microbiota Transplantation In Ulcerative Colitis: Systematic Review And Network Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Biological agents are commonly used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). As new treatments, tofacitinib, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have demonstrated efficacy in treating UC. This network meta-analysis aims to determine the efficacy and safety of biological agents, tofacitinib, and FMT.
METHODS: A network meta-analysis was conducted by systematically searching the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Libraries. According to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of biological agents, tofacitinib, and FMT in UC. A random-effect model was chosen by the network meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity test and publication bias test were performed to determine the efficacy of treatments.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 16 RCTs and we found that all treatments were more effective than the placebos. A total of 21 comparisons were made to determine efficiency. We found that infliximab, vedolizumab, and FMT performed better curative effect in terms of absolute effects and relative ranks. Furthermore, there was no statistical difference in the efficacy of biological agents, tofacitinib, and FMT. Moreover, no treatments were found to increase the occurrence of adverse events when compared with placebos, except infliximab. However, vedolizumab seemed to reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with infliximab.
CONCLUSION: Of the biological agents, vedolizumab and infliximab were the most effective, suggesting that biological agents are still a better choice. Nevertheless, tofacitinib and FMT may be promising alternatives with high efficacies. However, more safety and maintenance studies need to be conducted in future for the acquisition of more accurate results.Abbreviations: FMT: Fecal microbiota transplantation; UC: Ulcerative colitis; RCTs: Randomized controlled trials; IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease; CD: Crohn's disease; IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome; CDI: Clostridium difficile infections; ITT: Intention-to-treat; RR: Relative risk; CI: Confidence interval; CrI: Credible intervals; IFX: Infliximab; ADA: Adalimumab; TFB: Tofacitinib; GLM: Golimumab; VDZ: Vedolizumab; PBO: Placebo; wk: week; F: Female; M: Male; AEs: Adverse events; SAEs: Serious adverse events; anti-TNF: Anti-tumor necrosis factors.",Zhou HY; Guo B; Lufumpa E; Li XM; Chen LH; Meng X; Li BZ,2021,Immunological investigations,50,4,323-337,10.1080/08820139.2020.1714650,"Zhou, H.

36014953,Heart Rate Variability-An Index Of The Efficacy Of Complementary Therapies In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as a functional and psychosomatic disease, reduces the quality of life and increases the risk of developing mental disorders. Deregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is one of the main causes of the disease. The objective of the present study was to identify the studies in which measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) were performed before and after therapeutic intervention, and to evaluate the effectiveness of IBS therapy in terms of a reduction of IBS symptoms and changes in autonomic tone. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in accordance with PRISMA standards. Six databases were searched for articles published before 2022: PubMed®, MEDLINE®, EBSCO, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were experimental design, diagnosis of IBS (medical and/or diagnosis in accordance with the Rome Criteria), non-pharmacological intervention, and HRV measurement before and after the intervention. The quality of the studies was assessed by JBI Critical appraisal. In total, 455 studies were identified, of which, sixwere included in the review. Expected changes in HRV (increase in parasympathetic activity) were observed in four of the six studies (interventions studied: ear acupressure, transcutaneous auricular vagusnerve stimulation, cognitive behavioral therapy with relaxation elements, yoga). In the same studies, therapeutic interventions significantly reduced the symptoms of IBS. The present review indicated that interventions under investigation improve the efficiency of the ANS and reduce the symptoms of IBS. It is advisable to include HRV measurements as a measure of the effectiveness of interventions in IBS therapy, and to assess autonomic changes as a moderator of the effectiveness of IBS therapy.",Mróz M; Czub M; Brytek-Matera A,2022,Nutrients,14,16,,10.3390/nu14163447,"Mróz, M., Czub, M., & Brytek-Matera, A.

The real effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on skin cancer are still unclear, more than 3 years later. This study aims to summarise the pandemic's impact on skin cancer diagnosis and outcome. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, selecting studies comparing skin cancer diagnosis and prognosis post-pandemic with pre-pandemic data. A total of 27 papers were reviewed including 102,263 melanomas and 271,483 keratinocyte carcinomas. During the initial pandemic months (January-July 2020), melanoma surgeries dropped by 29.7% and keratinocyte carcinomas surgeries by 50.8%. Early pandemic tumours exhibited greater thickness and stage. In a long-term period beyond the initial months, melanoma surgeries decreased by 9.3%, keratinocyte carcinomas by 16.6%. No significant differences were observed in the Breslow thickness of melanomas after the start of the pandemic (mean difference 0.06, 95% confidence interval -0.46, 0.58). Melanomas operated on post-pandemic onset had an increased risk of ulceration (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.22-1.50). Keratinocyte carcinomas showed increased thickness and worsened stage post-pandemic. However, studies included were mostly retrospective and cross-sectional, reporting diverse data.

Meta-analyses were conducted for between-group comparisons of adverse events using incidence rate ratios. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the certainty of the evidence with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation.ResultsOut of 3436 records, 22 trials were included in this review (28 otherwise eligible trials were excluded for not reporting adverse events). No significant differences were observed between groups for minor/moderate [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.00, 95% CI: 0.71-1.41, p = 1.00] or major (IRR: 1.77, 95% CI: 0.55-5.70, p = 0.98) adverse events. Incidence was low for both videoconferencing (one every 410 sessions) and in-person (one every 414 sessions). Eighteen trials (82%) were graded 'some concerns' or 'high' on overall risk of bias score, primarily due to bias arising from measurement and selection of the reported adverse events. Certainty grading was 'low' for adverse event outcomes.ConclusionThis study suggests that there is no clear evidence of a difference in adverse event incidence between in-person and videoconferencing physical rehabilitation or exercise interventions.

32640737,The Impact Of Plant-Based Dietary Patterns On Cancer-Related Outcomes: A Rapid Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Long-term cancer survivors represent a sizeable portion of the population. Plant-based foods may enhance the prevention of cancer-related outcomes in these patients. We aimed to synthesize the current evidence regarding the impact of plant-based dietary patterns (PBDPs) on cancer-related outcomes in the general population and in cancer survivors. Considered outcomes included overall cancer mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and cancer recurrence. A rapid review was conducted, whereby 2234 original articles related to the topic were identified via Pubmed/Medline. We selected 26 articles, which were classified into studies on PBDPs and cancer outcomes at pre-diagnosis: vegan/vegetarian diet (N = 5), provegetarian diet (N = 2), Mediterranean diet (N = 13), and studies considering the same at post-diagnosis (N = 6). Pooled estimates of the associations between the aforementioned PBDPs and the different cancer outcomes were obtained by applying random effects meta-analysis. The few studies available on the vegetarian diet failed to support its prevention potential against overall cancer mortality when compared with a non-vegetarian diet (e.g., pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-1.06). The insufficient number of studies evaluating provegetarian index scores in relation to cancer mortality did not permit a comprehensive assessment of this association. The association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cancer mortality reached statistical significance (e.g., pooled HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79-0.89). However, no study considered the influence of prognostic factors on the associations. In contrast, post-diagnostic studies accounted for prognostic factors when assessing the chemoprevention potential of PBDPs, but also were inconclusive due to the limited number of studies on well-defined plant-based diets. Thus, whether plant-based diets before or after a cancer diagnosis prevent negative cancer-related outcomes needs to be researched further, in order to define dietary guidelines for cancer survivors.",Molina-Montes E; Salamanca-Fernández E; Garcia-Villanova B; Sánchez MJ,2020,Nutrients,12,7,,10.3390/nu12072010,"Molina-Montes, E., Salamanca-Fernández, E., Garcia-Villanova, B., & Sánchez, M.

38226581,Popular Diets And Nutritional Assessment In The Management Of Irritable Bowel Syndrome In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Overview Of Current Evidence.,"There is an increasing interest in using popular diets to manage inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. These conditions are often associated with nutritional deficiencies, protein‐energy malnutrition, micronutrient malnutrition, altered body composition, and sarcopenia. While dietary interventions can be supportive in treating intestinal symptoms of adult IBD patients, it is important to note that current guidelines from major scientific societies do not recommend any specific dietary interventions in this field. This review aims to provide a summary of the current evidence on dietary‐nutritional management for patients with IBD, specifically when the disease appears to be in remission, but the patient continues to experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms or functional gastrointestinal symptoms. We focus on vital aspects, such as malnutrition and sarcopenia definitions, screening, and nutritional assessment. We then discuss in detail the most popular diets used for IBD management over the years, characterizing each one in terms of effects on gut inflammation, IBS‐like symptoms, and potential risk of malnutrition. These diets include a low‐fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet, a gluten‐free diet, a Mediterranean diet, and a plant‐based diet. To date, current evidence does not conclusively establish the optimal diet for patients with IBS, suggesting that personalized dietary approaches may be the best strategy.",Covello C; Becherucci G; Scaldaferri F; Laterza L; Gasbarrini A; Mentella MC,2024,Polish archives of internal medicine,134,2,,10.20452/pamw.16659,"Covello, C., Becherucci, G., Scaldaferri, F., Laterza, L., Gasbarrini, A., & Mentella, M.

39402208,Digital Health Interventions Are Effective For Irritable Bowel Syndrome Self-Management: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) could be a valuable self-management tool for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little research exists on IBS-focused DHIs and their effectiveness. This review aimed to identify DHIs for IBS and evaluate their characteristics, effectiveness, and feasibility.
METHODS: Our study team, including patient partners, conducted a systematic review using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from database inception to May 2024. Experimental and observational studies evaluating DHIs designed for use by IBS patients were included. Data extraction and assessment included study and DHI characteristics, effectiveness outcomes (symptom severity, quality of life, psychological indices, patient empowerment), and feasibility measures (adherence, usability, user satisfaction). Study quality and bias were assessed using a modified checklist of Downs and Black.
RESULTS: Of the 929 identified, 13 studies of DHIs were included and deemed good quality on average (21,510 total participants) with six primary areas of focus: education, diet, brain-gut behavior skills, physiological support, health monitoring, and community engagement. Most DHIs were self-directed and reported statistically significant improvements in most effectiveness outcomes. Evidence suggests that DHIs focusing on brain-gut behavior skills or health monitoring may be most effective compared to other types of DHIs. However, their feasibility remains unclear, and the generalization of their impacts is limited.
CONCLUSION: This review underscores the potential of DHIs in supporting IBS patients and improving their outcomes. However, additional research is warranted for continued intervention use in this population, including assessments on feasibility, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient empowerment and experiences.",D'Silva A; Hua N; Modayil MV; Seidel J; Marshall DA,2025,Digestive diseases and sciences,70,2,644-664,10.1007/s10620-024-08672-7,"D'Silva, A., Hua, N., Modayil, M.

39336457,Oral And Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Due To Periodontitis: Systemic Implications And Links To Gastrointestinal Cancer: A Narrative Review.,"Periodontitis can disrupt oral and gut microbiota, leading to dysbiosis that affects overall systemic health. Besides the spread of periodontal pathogens by the hematogenous route, they can also be translocated into the gastrointestinal tract, possibly intervening in the neoplastic process in the gastrointestinal tract. This manuscript reviews the relationship between oral and gut microbiota due to periodontitis, discussing systemic health implications and potential links to gastrointestinal cancer. This article highlights the significance and effect of dysbiosis in the gut, emphasizing the importance of maintaining oral health to prevent systemic diseases. Lastly, it will go through therapeutic innovations such as probiotics and oral microbiota analysis tools for systemic disease detection. These findings will mark the integration of oral health management in clinical practice to lower systemic disease risk and improve overall patient outcomes. Aim of work: This manuscript aims to unravel the pathological interaction between oral and gut microbiota and their bidirectional effect on systemic diseases. Materials and methods: The review was performed using the MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases. Reviewed articles were published in English between the year 2015 and 2024. The search used keywords such as (""oral microbiota"" AND ""periodontal disease"") OR (""oral microbiota"" AND ""gastrointestinal cancer"") OR (""Porphyromonas gingivalis"" AND ""periodontal disease"") OR (""Helicobacter pylori"" AND ""gastric cancer"") OR (""gut microbiome"" AND ""inflammatory bowel disease"") OR (""oral microbiome"" AND ""systemic diseases""). Conclusions: The dysbiotic change in the oral cavity due to periodontitis is linked directly and indirectly to systemic diseases such as IBS, neurodegenerative diseases, muscle joint diseases, respiratory infections, and gastrointestinal cancer; this underscores the importance of maintaining oral hygiene for prophylaxis of oral diseases and the prevention of systemic diseases. A better understanding of the interconnections between oral health and systemic diseases will integrate oral health management to offer new prevention, diagnostic, and treatment opportunities to improve overall patient outcomes.",Sulaiman Y; Pacauskienė IM; Šadzevičienė R; Anuzyte R,2024,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",60,9,,10.3390/medicina60091416,"Sulaiman, Y., Pacauskienė, I.

38835657,Exploration Of The Mechanism Of Traditional Chinese Medicine For Anxiety And Depression In Patients With Diarrheal Irritable Bowel Syndrome Based On Network Pharmacology And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in managing irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) accompanied by anxiety and depression remains uncertain. Thus, a systematic review was carried out employing meta-analysis and network pharmacology to ascertain the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of CHM therapy.
METHODS: By conducting a systematic review, including literature search, screening, and data extraction, we identified 25 randomized controlled trials to assess CHM's effectiveness in treating irritable bowel syndrome alongside anxiety and depression. Network pharmacology was utilized to scrutinize the metabolite utility of CHM in addressing this condition. Potential primary mechanisms were synthesized using information sourced from the PubMed database.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies, including 2055 patients, were analyzed, revealing significant treatment efficacy for IBS-D in the trial group compared to controls [OR = 4.01, 95% CI (2.99, 5.36), I2 = 0%] Additionally, treatment for depression [SMD = -1.08, 95% CI (-1.30, -0.86), p < 0.00001, I2 = 68%; SDS: SMD = -1.69, 95% CI (-2.48, -0.90), p < 0.0001, I2 = 96%] and anxiety [HAMA: SMD = -1.29, 95% CI (-1.68, -0.91), p < 0.00001, I2 = 89%; SAS: SMD = -1.75, 95% CI (-2.55, -0.95), p < 0.00001, I2 = 96%] significantly improved in the trial group. Furthermore, the trial group exhibited a significantly lower disease relapse rate [OR = 0.30, 95% CI (0.20, 0.44), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%]. CHM treatment consistently improved IBS severity (IBS-SSS) and symptom scores. Network pharmacology analysis identified key chemical metabolites in traditional Chinese medicine formulations, including Beta-sitosterol, Stigmasterol, Quercetin, Naringenin, Luteolin, Kaempferol, Nobiletin, Wogonin, Formononetin, and Isorhamnetin. Utilizing the STRING database and Cytoscape v3.9.0 software, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed the top eight key targets: IL-6, TNF, PPARG, PTGS2, ESR1, NOS3, MAPK8, and AKT1, implicated in anti-inflammatory responses, antioxidant stress modulation, and neurotransmitter homeostasis maintenance.
CONCLUSION: Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) offers a promising and safe treatment approach for patients dealing with Diarrheal Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) accompanied by anxiety and depression; thus, indicating its potential for practical implementation. The most active metabolites of CHM could simultaneously act on the pathological targets of IBS-D, anxiety, and depression.The diverse scope of CHM's therapeutic role includes various aspects and objectives, underscoring its potential for broad utilization.",Bai C; Wang J; Wang Y; Liu H; Li J; Wang S; Bai Z; Guo R,2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,15,,1404738,10.3389/fphar.2024.1404738,"Bai, C., Wang, J., Wang, Y., Liu, H., Li, J., Wang, S., Bai, Z., & Guo, R.

40573159,Efficacy Of A Low-Fodmap Diet On The Severity Of Gastrointestinal Symptoms And Quality Of Life In The Treatment Of Gastrointestinal Disorders-A Systematic Review Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Background: A low-FODMAP diet is considered as a potential supportive treatment approach in some gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet on the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with CASP tool and PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases resulted in the identification of fourteen randomized controlled trials. Results: Ten studies examined the effect of the low-FODMAP diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), three with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and one with symptomatic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). All interventions compared the low-FODMAP diet with another diet and lasted from 3 to 12 weeks. Most studies on IBS showed significant improvements in abdominal pain, bloating, and quality of life compared to control diets. In IBD, improvements were mainly observed in functional gastrointestinal symptoms, while no clear benefit was demonstrated in GERD. Heterogeneity in study designs, intervention durations, comparator diets, and outcome measures limited the ability to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions: Although a low-FODMAP diet may reduce symptoms in selected individuals, it is not universally necessary. Importantly, the diet's restrictive nature and potential long-term effects-such as nutritional deficiencies and alterations in gut microbiota-highlight the need for clinical supervision by dietitians with expertise in gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, in some cases, symptom improvement may be achievable through less restrictive changes, such as improving food hygiene and reducing intake of processed or high-sugar foods. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials with standardized endpoints and longer follow-up are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of the low-FODMAP diet across various gastrointestinal conditions.",Kuźmin L; Kubiak K; Lange E,2025,Nutrients,17,12,,10.3390/nu17122045,"Kuźmin, L., Kubiak, K., & Lange, E.

35456802,A Combination Of Mediterranean And Low-Fodmap Diets For Managing Ibs Symptoms? Ask Your Gut!,"Among other factors, food intolerance is cardinal in triggering irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in a significant percentage of patients. As a result, specific dietary patterns are the first-line therapeutic approach. The low-FODMAP diet (LFD) is gaining ground as the most well-documented diet intervention that significantly reduces IBS symptoms. Though the LFD improves symptoms, the diet's impact on intestinal low-grade inflammation, one of the cardinal mechanisms contributing to symptom development, remains doubtful. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is recommended for chronic low-grade inflammation-related diseases because of its anti-inflammatory properties, derived predominantly from olive oil and phenolic compounds. Thus far, the role of a modified LFD, enriched with the MedDiet's anti-inflammatory components, has not been evaluated in IBS patients. This review aims to examine the hypothesis of a potential combination of the immunomodulatory effects of the MedDiet with the LFD to improve IBS symptoms.",Kasti A; Petsis K; Lambrinou S; Katsas K; Nikolaki M; Papanikolaou IS; Hatziagelaki E; Triantafyllou K,2022,Microorganisms,10,4,,10.3390/microorganisms10040751,"Kasti, A., Petsis, K., Lambrinou, S., Katsas, K., Nikolaki, M., Papanikolaou, I.

38253876,Irritable Bowel Syndrome In Children: The Placebo Response Rate And Influencing Factors A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is common in children and exhibits a high placebo response. This study was to explore the placebo response rate and its influencing factors in children with irritable bowel syndrome.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed on Pubmed, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and CBM from database inception to March 2022. Randomized controlled trials of irritable bowel syndrome in children were included in the study. The primary outcome was the placebo response rate of improvement.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included, with 445 patients in the placebo group. The rate of improvement and abdominal pain disappearance were 28.2% (95% CI, 16.6-39.9%) and 5% (95% CI, 0-18.4%). The placebo response based on the abdominal pain score was 0.675 (95% CI, 0.203-1.147). The mode of administration (P < 0.01), dosing schedule (P < 0.01), and clinical outcome assessor (P = 0.04) have a significant impact on the magnitude of placebo effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The placebo response rate for pediatric irritable bowel syndrome was 28.2%. In clinical trials, reducing dosing frequency, selecting appropriate dosage forms, and using patient-reported outcomes can help mitigate the placebo effect.
IMPACT: This is the first meta-analysis to assess the placebo response rates for improvement and disappearance in children with IBS. The finding suggested that the mode of administration, dosing schedule, and clinical outcome assessor could potentially influence the magnitude of the placebo effect in children with IBS. This study would provide a basis for estimating sample size in clinical trial design with a placebo control.",Cai LL; Li X; Cai QH; Guo SX; Zhang Y; Sun WC; Zhao ZH; Hu SY,2024,Pediatric research,95,6,1432-1440,10.1038/s41390-023-02996-2,"Cai, L.

38613127,Efficacy Of A Low-Fodmap Diet For Coeliac Patients With Persistent Ibs-Like Symptoms Despite A Gluten-Free Diet: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Persistent symptoms in coeliac disease (CD) can be due to not only poor gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence and complications of CD, but also functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the role of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is well-established in IBS, little data are available on its role in coeliac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite a GFD. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for studies evaluating the role of FODMAPs and/or a low-FODMAP diet in coeliac patients with persistent symptoms. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 16 January 2024 for eligible full-text papers. The study protocol was registered on Open Science Framework. Results: A total of 239 records were identified, and six papers were included. Of these, four were interventional studies comparing a low-FODMAP GFD to a regular GFD for persistent symptoms in 115 total coeliac patients (two randomized controlled trials and two open-label studies). A low-FODMAP GFD for a minimum of 4 weeks was significantly more effective than a regular GFD in reducing symptoms (p < 0.05 in 3/4 studies). Dietary FODMAP content of a conventional GFD was significantly lower than that of non-coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet (both p < 0.05), especially regarding high-FODMAP grain products. However, coeliac patients consumed more servings of fruits/vegetables high in FODMAP. No relationship between FODMAP intake and persistence of symptoms was reported. Conclusions: A low-FODMAP diet may be beneficial for uncomplicated celiac patients with persistent IBS-like symptoms despite strict adherence to a GFD.",Lusetti F; Schiepatti A; Scalvini D; Maimaris S; Biagi F,2024,Nutrients,16,7,,10.3390/nu16071094,"Lusetti, F., Schiepatti, A., Scalvini, D., Maimaris, S., & Biagi, F.

40148656,Recurrent Abdominal Pain In A Child - Evaluation And Management.,"Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is defined as the presence of at least 3 episodes of abdominal pain for 3 mo duration, including both organic and functional etiology. Up to 95% of the causes of RAP are due to functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD). Peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, abdominal tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), parasitic infection, and urinary tract infection (UTI) are prominent organic causes of RAP. The published data from developed countries reported pooled prevalence of FAPD in children is 13.5%, in which irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common sub-type. The evaluation includes history taking regarding pain characteristics, associated symptoms, and the presence of stressors. A detailed history and examination are required to assess for alarm symptoms and signs. The presence of alarm symptoms increases the chances of organic etiology for RAP. Basic work-ups such as complete blood counts, stool and urine examinations, serum albumin, and inflammatory markers may be required to look for chronic organic etiologies. Fecal calprotectin (FCP) is a highly sensitive tool to differentiate IBD from IBS. Ultrasound abdomen (USG) helps in the evaluation of cholelithiasis, biliary obstruction, chronic pancreatitis, malrotation, and bowel thickening. Endoscopies are useful for peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, abdominal tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori infection, etc. Organic causes need specific management. FAPD requires patient counselling and medications.

32014597,The Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Evidence Based On 35 Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder that may involve disturbance of the gastrointestinal microbiota. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of probiotics in patients with IBS.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases up to 1 April, 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with IBS that compared probiotics to placebo or no therapy were eligible for the analysis. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to calculate the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of remaining symptoms after therapy. Continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with the 95% CI. Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.
RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs involving 3,452 patients were included in the analysis. Compared with placebo, patients using probiotics had a lower incidence of persistence of symptoms (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89, P < 0.0001). Also, probiotics exerted a beneficial effect on global symptoms and the abdominal pain score (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.14, P < 0.00001), bloating score (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.03, P = 0.01), and flatulence score (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05, P = 0.01). However, patients treated with probiotics had a higher incidence of any adverse event (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.44).

In the current review, scientific literature including original research articles, clinical studies, epidemiological reports, and review-type articles concerning human intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the possible consequences on the microbiota were reviewed. Moreover, the following aspects pertaining to COVID-19 have also been discussed: transmission, resistance in the human body, the impact of nutritional status in relation to the intestinal microbiota, and the impact of comorbid metabolic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), obesity, and type two diabetes (T2D). The articles investigated show that health, age, and nutritional status are associated with specific communities of bacterial species in the gut, which could influence the clinical course of COVID-19 infection. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Patients suffering from metabolic and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are thought to be at a moderate-to-high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating the direct implication of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 severity.

39315667,"Evaluating Equity In Clinical Trial Accessibility: An Analysis Of Demographic, Socioeconomic, And Educational Disparities In Irritable Bowel Syndrome Drug Trials.","INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder of gut-brain interaction, imposes a significant economic burden because of its high prevalence and the chronic nature of its symptoms. IBS currently has 7 United States Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Despite efforts to improve diversity in randomized controlled trials' participation, significant disparities remain in various medical fields; yet, these have not been thoroughly examined within the context of IBS. We aimed to investigate the demographic, socioeconomic, educational, and geographic disparities in IBS drug trials.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of phase 3 randomized controlled trials on United States Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of IBS with constipation and IBS with diarrhea in the United States. Data on participant demographics and trial site locations were extracted and analyzed to identify disparities.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 17 studies encompassing 21 trials with 17,428 participants. Approximately 77.3% of participants were female, with a mean age of 45.4 years. Race was reported in 95% of the trials, but only 35% disclosed ethnicity. White participants constituted the majority at 79.3%. Hispanics accounted for only 5.9%. Counties without trial sites had smaller average population sizes compared with trial and trial-adjacent counties. Socioeconomic indicators such as poverty rates, median household income, educational attainment, and broadband internet access were lower in counties without trial sites, with higher average Area Deprivation Index scores indicating greater deprivation.
DISCUSSION: The findings highlight significant disparities in IBS trial participation across race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. A total of 84 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in BC patients with LNM. Of these, a meta-analysis was performed in two microRNAs that were present in at least 3 different articles with a coherent expression direction: miR-155 and miR-34a. The meta-analysis returned a pooled a Log2 fold change of 1.50 for miR-155 (upregulated) and -0.53 for miR-34a (downregulated) with no evidence of publication bias, and a low risk of bias and applicability concerns. To conclude, this study names miR-155 and miR-34a as potential diagnostic biomarkers for LNM in BC, although further experimental validation is necessary to confirm these findings and develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for clinical use.",Martínez CG; Therapontos S; Lorente JA; Lucena MA; Ortega FG; Serrano MJ,2025,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,207,,104598,10.1016/j.critrevonc.2024.104598,"Martínez, C.

40497389,Manifestations Of The Oral Mucosa And Salivary Glands In Irritable Bowel Syndrome And Microscopic Colitis - A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: There is a well-established association of oral manifestations in the non-infectious chronic diarrhoeal conditions namely, Morbus Crohn, ulcerative colitis, and coeliac disease. Such a connection may exist also for the remaining non-infectious chronic diarrhoeal conditions, that is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and microscopic colitis (MC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Scopus and PubMed, rendering a total of 710 articles to be screened. All articles were screened independently and assessed for eligibility reporting comorbidity between either IBS or MC, and oral symptoms/disease. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed.
RESULTS: In all, 17 articles were included. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in patients with IBS ranged from 3% to 33% and for IBS in SS between 29% to 62%. Dry mouth, bad breath, and foul taste were overrepresented in these patients. The occurrence of SS in patients with MC ranged from 2% to 9%, and for MC in SS from 1% to 2%.
CONCLUSIONS: An association between SS and IBS and MC, respectively, is plausible. Few articles have explored other oral manifestations. Therefore, no specific conclusions can be drawn. It is pivotal to further explore oral manifestations of these conditions bridging the gap between dental care and general medicine to optimise diagnostics, treatment strategies, and ultimately patient care.",Göthlin H; Hasséus B; Sjöberg K; Bankvall M,2025,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,84,,349-362,10.2340/aos.v84.43870,"Göthlin, H., Hasséus, B., Sjöberg, K., & Bankvall, M.

38743845,Can Hypnotherapy Be Considered A Valuable Component In The Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease? Insights From A Comprehensive Review.,"Despite advancements in medication,managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains challenging, necessitatingalternative control methods. Gut-directed hypnotherapy, known for alleviating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is debated as an IBD management method. Anextensive search across PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.govuncovered five randomized trials and two case series involving IBD patients undergoing hypnotherapy. A small trial reported statistically significant remission at one year (p = .04), but larger trials, including one with 63 patients, showed no significant gastrointestinal improvements. The first case series noted post-intervention reduction in the mediators of inflammation in rectal mucosal, without long-term monitoring. The second case series observed the absence of flare episodes in 12 of 13 ulcerative colitis patients during follow-up, possibly influenced by the simultaneous use of two drugs alongside hypnotherapy. Psychological outcomes, demonstrated no significant differences between hypnotherapy and control groups. While current literature doesn't decisively support hypnotherapy for managing IBD symptoms, it underscores the importance of further research, including randomized clinical trials, to thoroughly assess its effectiveness in this context.",Mpakogiannis K; Fousekis FS; Katsanos AH; Katsanos KH,2024,The International journal of clinical and experimental hypnosis,72,3,274-288,10.1080/00207144.2024.2350460,"Mpakogiannis, K., Fousekis, F.

An undisturbed gut microbiota needs to be sustained in order to perform all physiological, metabolic, and immune functions in a normal way to prevent the development of diseases. This article has reviewed the published information on the issue of disruption of the balance of the gut microbiota. This disruption could be for many reasons, such as microbial infection in the gastrointestinal tract, food poisoning, diarrhoea, chemotherapy, malnutrition, lifestyle, and ageing. If this disruption is not restored to normal, it might cause dysbiosis. Eventually, a gut microbiota interrupted by dysbiosis might initiate several health issues, such as inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, the induction of cancer, and the progression of a variety of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This review concluded that biotherapy is a natural way of using probiotic products, whether in form of food, beverages, or supplements, to restore the gut microbiota disrupted by dysbiosis. Metabolites secreted by the ingested probiotics help to relieve gastrointestinal tract inflammation and can avoid the induction of cancer.",Dahiya D; Nigam PS,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,6,,10.3390/ijms24065748,"Dahiya, D., & Nigam, P.

40529486,Efficacy And Safety Of Chinese Botanical Drug Si Shen Wan In Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis And Trial Sequential Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), characterized by complex pathogenesis, prolonged disease duration, frequent recurrence, and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Si-Shen-Wan (SSW), a renowned traditional Chinese medicine formula, is widely recognized for its efficacy in managing gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea, and is commonly used to treat diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). This study utilized a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SSW in the treatment of IBS-D.
METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted across seven databases from their inception to 31 October 2024. The analysis included outcomes such as efficacy rate, overall symptom score, abdominal pain score, diarrhea score, abdominal distension score, loss of appetite score, recurrence rate, and adverse events. Meta-analyses were performed using either a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was applied to estimate the sample size and validate the robustness of the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 34 RCTs involving 2,976 participants met the inclusion criteria. The findings demonstrated that SSW alone (RR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.34; P < 0.00001) or combined with biomedicine (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.35; P < 0.00001) significantly improved treatment efficacy compared to biomedicine alone. SSW also reduced the overall symptom score (SMD = -1.06; 95% CI: -1.50, -0.61; Z = 4.66; P < 0.00001) and alleviated key symptoms, including abdominal pain (MD = -0.66; 95% CI: -0.76, -0.56; Z = 12.99; P < 0.00001), diarrhea (MD = -0.69; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.56; Z = 10.82; P < 0.00001), abdominal distension (MD = -0.65; 95% CI: -1.06, -0.24; Z = 3.13; P = 0.002), and loss of appetite (MD = -0.55; 95% CI: -0.66, -0.44; Z = 9.80; P < 0.00001). The recurrence rate was also significantly reduced (RR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.55; P < 0.00001). Additionally, SSW combined with moxibustion-a traditional Chinese medicine therapy integrating internal and external treatments-also further improved treatment outcomes (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37; P = 0.0001). This combination effectively reduced abdominal pain (MD = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.04; Z = 2.17; P = 0.03), diarrhea (MD = -0.41; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.17; Z = 3.41; P = 0.0006), abdominal distension (MD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.69, -0.11; Z = 2.67; P = 0.008), and loss of appetite (MD = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.49, -0.10; Z = 2.93; P = 0.003). Safety analysis revealed a high level of safety for SSW and SSW combined with moxibustion, with no serious adverse events reported in any of the included trials. TSA confirmed an adequate sample size for the primary outcome, supporting the efficacy of SSW in IBS-D treatment.
CONCLUSION: SSW, either used alone or combined with moxibustion, is effective in alleviating IBS-D symptoms and reducing recurrence rates, making it a potentially beneficial intervention. However, certain limitations remain in the overall quality of the current studies, including relatively small sample sizes, insufficiently long follow-up periods, and the absence of a double-blind design. Future research should emphasize the design and implementation of high-quality, long-term, randomized, double-blind clinical trials to further enhance the reliability and external applicability of the research findings.

39854263,Impact Of Vitamin D Supplementation On Symptom Severity And Quality Of Life In Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D supplementation could offer irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients significant improvements in terms of symptom severity and overall quality of life (QoL). Yet, the potential benefits and risks associated with vitamin D supplementation still require additional investigation.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IBS using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out utilizing 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) to identify articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals. The odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), along with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), were computed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the appropriate p-value and Cochrane Q and I2 statistics. For the analysis, RevMan 5.3 was utilized.
RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials involving a total of 780 participants were included in this study. Vitamin D supplementation, in adolescents and young adults with IBS, improves the IBS symptoms severity score, QoL and serum 25(OH)D levels compared to controls. We obtained an OR of 2.34 (95% CI: 1.56-3.50) for change in the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), OR = 2.51 (95% CI: 1.71-3.70) for change in QoL, low risk of any adverse events (RR 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35-0.69)), and substantial changes in serum 25(OH)D level (MD = 11.29 (95% CI: 7.13-15.45)). Results were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

40786606,"Anaerobic Gut Bacteria And Their Potential Role In The Initiation, Exacerbation, And Development Of Human Colorectal Cancer: A Narrative Review.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths around the world. Rectal bleeding, changes in bowel movements, weight loss, and fatigue are the main clinical presentations of CRC. While the exact etiology of the disease is unknown, CRC is considered a complex and multifactorial disease resulted from an intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, CRC is known as a chronic inflammation-associated tumor, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are susceptible groups to CRC development. The gut microbiota and its metabolites play a crucial role in the development and progression of CRC. CRC can be created after anaerobic bacterial infections such as Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), Fusobacterium, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, etc. Activation of Wnt signaling, loss of tissue architecture, proinflammatory signaling, and genotoxic cellular DNA damage are the primary mechanisms by which anaerobic bacteria induce carcinogenesis in CRC. Besides, spore germination and toxin production are done in hypoxic and acidic conditions. Therefore, according to the presence of this condition (anaerobic glycolysis) in tumor tissue, the tumor environment is suitable for the formation of anaerobic infections. The current review-based study aims to discuss the important aspects of these mechanisms and their possible roles in the initiation, development, and exacerbation of CRC.",Sabour S; Sadeghi Koupaei H; Ghasemi H; Amin M; Azimi T,2025,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,15,,1559001,10.3389/fcimb.2025.1559001,"Sabour, S., Sadeghi Koupaei, H., Ghasemi, H., Amin, M., & Azimi, T.

38599319,"Diet, Food, And Nutritional Exposures And Inflammatory Bowel Disease Or Progression Of Disease: An Umbrella Review.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), contributes to substantial morbidity. Understanding the intricate interplay between dietary factors and the incidence and progression of IBD is essential for developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. This umbrella review comprehensively synthesizes evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate these complex associations. Dietary factors associated with an increased incidence and/or progression of IBD include a high intake of red and processed meat, other processed foods, and refined sugars, together with a low intake of vegetables, fruits, and fiber. For most other food groups, the results are mixed or indicate no clear associations with IBD, CD, and UC. Some differences seem to exist between UC and CD and their risk factors, with increased intake of dietary fiber being inversely associated with CD incidence but not clearly associated with UC. Dietary fiber may contribute to maintaining the gut epithelial barrier and reduce inflammation, often through interactions with the gut microbiota. This seems to play an important role in inflammatory mechanisms in the gut and in IBD incidence and progression. Diets low in fermentable saccharides and polyols can alleviate symptom burden, but there are concerns regarding their impact on the gut microbiota and their nutritional adequacy. Mediterranean diets, vegetarian diets, and a diet low in grains, sugars, and lactose (specific carbohydrate diet) are also associated with lower incidence and/or progression of IBD. The associations of dietary patterns are mirrored by inflammatory biomarkers. IBD is typically treated pharmaceutically; however, many patients have a suboptimal response to medical treatments. The findings from this umbrella review could provide evidence for nutritional counseling and be a valuable addition to traditional treatment plans for IBD.

37111210,Nutritional Status And Its Detection In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"Malnutrition is an important issue in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It is caused by altered digestion and absorption within the small bowel, inadequate food intake, and drug-nutrient interactions in patients. Malnutrition is an essential problem because it is related to an increased risk of infections and poor prognosis in patients. It is known that malnutrition is also related to an increased risk of postsurgery complications in IBD patients. Basic nutritional screening involves anthropometric parameters with body mass index (BMI) and others (fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, muscle strength), medical history concerning weight loss, and biochemical parameters (including the Prognostic Nutritional Index). Besides standard nutritional screening tools, including the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Nutritional Risk Score 2002 (NRS 2002), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), specific nutritional screening tools are used in IBD patients, such as the Saskatchewan Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Nutrition Risk Tool (SaskIBD-NR Tool and IBD-specific Nutritional Screening Tool). There is a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies (including iron, zinc, magnesium) and vitamin deficiencies (including folic acid, vitamin B12 and D) in IBD patients. Therefore, regular evaluation of nutritional status is important in IBD patients because many of them are undernourished. An association between plasma ghrelin and leptin and nutritional status in IBD patients has been observed. According to some authors, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) therapy (infliximab) can improve nutritional status in IBD patients. On the other hand, improvement in nutritional status may increase the response rate to infliximab therapy in CD patients. Optimization of nutritional parameters is necessary to improve results of conservative and surgical treatment and to prevent postoperative complications in patients with IBDs. This review presents basic nutritional screening tools, anthropometric and laboratory parameters, dietary risk factors for IBDs, common nutrient deficiencies, associations between anti-TNFα therapy and nutritional status, selected features regarding the influence of nutritional status, and surgical outcome in IBD patients.",Jabłońska B; Mrowiec S,2023,Nutrients,15,8,,10.3390/nu15081991,"Jabłońska, B., & Mrowiec, S.

The reported prevalence of malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients ranges between 20% and 85%. Several factors, including reduced oral food intake, malabsorption, chronic blood and proteins loss, and intestinal bacterial overgrowth, contribute to malnutrition in IBD patients. Poor nutritional status, as well as selective malnutrition or sarcopenia, is associated with poor clinical outcomes, response to therapy and, therefore, quality of life.

37274062,Study Of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor In The Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are part of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) and have pathophysiological processes such as bowel necrosis and enteric neurons and enteric glial cells. In addition, the main inflammatory mediator is related to the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). TNF-α is a me-diator of the intestinal inflammatory processes, thus being one of the main cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, however, its levels, when measured, are present in the serum of patients with IBD. In addition, TNF-α plays an important role in promoting inflammation, such as the production of interleukins (IL), for instance IL-1β and IL-6. There are two receptors for TNF as following: The tumor necrosis factor 1 receptor (TNFR1); and the tumor necrosis factor 2 receptor (TNFR2). They are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and their receptors have been detected in IBD and their expression is correlated with disease activity. The soluble TNF form binds to the TNFR1 receptor with, and its activation results in a signaling cascade effects such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. In contrast, the transmembrane TNF form can bind both to TNFR1 and TNFR2. Recent studies have suggested that TNF-α is one of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, since TNF levels are present in the serum of both patients with UC and CD. Intravenous and subcutaneous biologics targeting TNF-α have revolutionized the treatment of IBD, thus becoming the best available agents to induce and maintain IBD remission. The application of antibodies aimed at neutralizing TNF-α in patients with IBD that induce a satisfactory clinical response in up to 60% of patients, and also induced long-term maintenance of disease remission in most patients. It has been suggested that anti-TNF-α agents inactivate the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α by direct neutralization, i.e., resulting in suppression of inflammation. However, anti-TNF-α antibodies perform more complex functions than a simple blockade.",Souza RF; Caetano MAF; Magalhães HIR; Castelucci P,2023,World journal of gastroenterology,29,18,2733-2746,10.3748/wjg.v29.i18.2733,"Souza, R.

38505875,Dietary Therapies For Adult And Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Diet is an environmental exposure implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary therapy is also a tool for management of these conditions. Nutrition therapy for IBD has been shown to reduce intestinal inflammation, promote healing, and alleviate symptoms, as well as improve patients' nutrition status. Although the mechanisms of action of most nutrition therapies for IBD are not well understood, the diets are theorized to eliminate triggers for gut dysbiosis and mucosal immune dysfunction associated with the typical Western diet. Exclusive enteral nutrition and the Crohn's disease exclusion diet are increasingly being used as the primary treatment modality for the induction of remission and/or maintenance therapy in children, and in some adults, with CD. Several other diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, anti-inflammatory diet for IBD, and diets excluding gluten, FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols), lactose, or other compounds, may be helpful in symptom management in both CD and UC, though evidence for biochemical efficacy is limited.

36771373,Current Nutritional Therapies In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Improving Clinical Remission Rates And Sustainability Of Long-Term Dietary Therapies.,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) includes a spectrum of chronic immune-mediated intestinal diseases thought to be related to the complex interaction between the host immune system and the intestinal microbiome. Research supports the use of nutritional therapy in IBD; however, it is not routinely used in clinical practice. This literature review seeks to advance the understanding of diet and its effect in IBD with a focus on both Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The contribution of diet to the development and treatment of IBD cannot be overstated. In both pediatric as well as adult IBD, nutritional interventions have been shown to improve clinical symptoms as well as inflammatory burden. The impact of dietary intervention is best exemplified through the use of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) in CD. EEN and clinical research on exclusionary whole food diets-Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED), Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet, and Mediterranean Diet-are discussed within this review. Current clinical literature supports the elimination of detrimental components and the incorporation of low processed whole foods in the diet.

37317532,Efficacy And Safety Of Advanced Oral Small Molecules For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oral small-molecule drugs [SMDs] are expanding the therapeutic landscape for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitor [JAKi] and sphingosine-1-phosphate [S1P] receptor modulator treatments for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD].
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to May 30, 2022. Randomized controlled trials [RCTs] of JAKi and S1P receptor modulators in adults with UC or CD were eligible. Clinical, endoscopic, histological, and safety data were pooled and analysed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty-five RCTs [26 UC, nine CD] were included. In UC, JAKi therapy was associated with induction of clinical (risk ratio [RR] 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03-4.92; I2 = 65%) and endoscopic [RR 3.99, 95% CI 2.36-6.75; I2 = 36%] remission compared to placebo. Upadacitinib was associated with histological response [RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.97-3.53]. S1P modulator therapy was associated with induction of clinical [RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.88-3.39; I2 = 1%] and endoscopic [RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.07-5.33; I2 = 0%] remission relative to placebo. Ozanimod was superior to placebo for inducing histological remission in UC [RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.43-3.37; I2 = 0%], while etrasimod was not [RR 2.36, 95% CI 0.71-7.88; I2 = 0%]. In CD, JAKi therapy was superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission [RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.98; I2 = 31%], and endoscopic remission [RR 4.78, 95% CI 1.63-14.06; I2 = 43%] compared to placebo. The risk of serious infections was similar for oral SMDs and placebo.
CONCLUSION: JAKi and S1P receptor modulator therapies are effective in IBD for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission and, in some circumstances, histological response.",Solitano V; Vuyyuru SK; MacDonald JK; Zayadi A; Parker CE; Narula N; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S; Feagan BG; Singh S; Ma C; Jairath V,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,11,1800-1816,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad100,"Solitano, V., Vuyyuru, S.

37506265,Early Biologic Treatment Decreases Risk Of Surgery In Crohn'S Disease But Not In Ulcerative Colitis: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can lead to long-term complications that significantly impact patients' quality of life and healthcare resource utilization. Prior studies have demonstrated improved short-term outcomes to early exposure of biologics in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) but not in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, there are conflicting data on impact of early intervention on longer-term adverse events. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the impact of early biologic treatment on rates of IBD-related surgery.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in April 2022. Studies were included if biologic initiation was compared between patients starting early (<3 years of diagnosis or top-down treatment) vs later (>3 years of diagnosis or step-up treatment). Studies with <1 year of follow-up were excluded. The outcomes were colectomy and CD-related surgery for patients with UC and CD, respectively. Random-effects analyses were conducted to compare rates of IBD surgery between early and late biologic treatment.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Three studies included patients with UC and 15 studies included patients with CD. In patients with CD, early biologic therapy was associated with lower odds of surgery (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.84) compared with late treatment. Conversely, in patients with UC, the odds of colectomy were increased (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-6.30).
CONCLUSIONS: Early biologic treatment is associated with lower rates of surgery in patients with CD. In contrast, early biologic therapy appears to be associated with higher rates of colectomy in patients with UC, which may be confounded by disease severity.",Law CCY; Tkachuk B; Lieto S; Narula N; Walsh S; Colombel JF; Ungaro RC,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,7,1080-1086,10.1093/ibd/izad149,"Law, C.

38665795,Role Of Diet In Prevention Versus Treatment Of Crohn'S Disease And Ulcerative Colitis.,"Diet is a modifiable risk factor for disease course and data over the past decade have emerged to indicate its role in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, literature is riddled with misinterpretation of data, often leading to unexpected or conflicting results. The key understanding is that causative factors in disease development do not always proceed to an opportunity to change disease course, once established. Here, we discuss the data on dietary influences in three distinct disease states for CD and UC-predisease, active disease and quiescent disease. We appraise the literature for how our dietary recommendations should be shaped to prevent disease development and if or how that differs for CD and UC induction therapy and maintenance therapy. In UC, principles of healthy eating are likely to play a role in all states of disease. Conversely, data linking dietary factors to CD prevention and treatment are paradoxical with the highest quality evidence for CD treatment being exclusive enteral nutrition, a lactose, gluten and fibre-free diet comprising solely of ultraprocessed food-all dietary factors that are not associated or inversely associated with CD prevention. High-quality evidence from dietary trials is much awaited to expand our understanding and ultimately lead our dietary recommendations for targeted patient populations.",Halmos EP; Godny L; Vanderstappen J; Sarbagili-Shabat C; Svolos V,2024,Frontline gastroenterology,15,3,247-257,10.1136/flgastro-2023-102417,"Halmos, E.

39106167,Efficacy And Safety Of Probiotics In Ibd: An Overview Of Systematic Reviews And Updated Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Probiotics show promise in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet knowledge gaps persist. We performed an overview of systematic reviews and an updated metanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effect of probiotics on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to September 2023. Primary outcomes were clinical remission and recurrence; secondary outcomes included endoscopic response and remission, and adverse events. We calculated odds ratios (OR) using a random-effects model in R. The quality of systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR-2; the trials' risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Evidence certainty was rated using the GRADE framework.
RESULTS: Out of 2613 results, 67 studies (22 systematic reviews and 45 RCTs) met the eligibility criteria. In the updated meta-analysis, the OR for clinical remission in UC and CD was 2.00 (95% CI 1.28-3.11) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.21-12.50), respectively. The subgroup analysis suggested that combining 5-ASA and probiotics may be beneficial for inducing remission in mild-to-moderate UC (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.29-4.28). Probiotics decreased the odds of recurrence in relapsing pouchitis (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.25) and trended toward reducing clinical recurrence in inactive UC (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.01). No protective effect against recurrence was identified for CD. Multi-strain formulations appear superior in achieving remission and preventing recurrence in UC. The use of probiotics was not associated with better endoscopic outcomes. Adverse events were similar to control. However, the overall certainty of evidence was low.
CONCLUSION: Probiotics, particularly multi-strain formulations, appear efficacious for the induction of clinical remission and the prevention of relapse in UC patients as well as for relapsing pouchitis. Notwithstanding, no significant effect was identified for CD. The favorable safety profile of probiotics was also highlighted.",Estevinho MM; Yuan Y; Rodríguez-Lago I; Sousa-Pimenta M; Dias CC; Barreiro-de Acosta M; Jairath V; Magro F,2024,United European gastroenterology journal,12,7,960-981,10.1002/ueg2.12636,"Estevinho, M.

38980426,Immunity In Digestive Diseases: New Drugs For Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment-Insights From Phase Ii And Iii Trials.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), continues to challenge treatment paradigms. Advancements in therapeutic options have been have been driven by Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of new drug classes, particularly sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulators and interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitors.
METHODS: This review synthesizes findings from Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials conducted up to early 2024, focusing on the impact of S1P modulators and IL-23 inhibitors on IBD management. Drugs such as ozanimod, etrasimod, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab, and brasikumab were evaluated for their efficacy and safety profiles.
RESULTS: S1P modulators, such as ozanimod and etrasimod, effectively regulate immune cell trafficking to reduce inflammation and several trials highlight their clinical effectiveness in both inducing and maintaining remission in IBD, highlighting its long-term safety and sustained therapeutic effects. Additionally, IL-23 inhibitors including risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab, which disrupt key inflammatory cytokine pathways, have already shown significant effectiveness in inducing and maintaining remission in both CD and UC, with favorable safety profiles across multiple studies, suggesting their potential as critical components in managing IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trials indicate that both S1P modulators and IL-23 inhibitors offer promising therapeutic benefits and maintain strong safety profiles, positioning them as potential cornerstone treatments for IBD.

34820868,Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis: Environmental And Dietary Differences Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease In Eastern And Western Populations.,"BACKGROUND: While the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has stabilised in the West, it is still increasing in several newly industrialised countries.
AIMS: To investigate whether the environmental and dietary risk factors for IBD differ between Eastern and Western populations METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published from inception through June 30, 2020. Data were pooled using a random effects model.
RESULTS: Overall, 255 studies were assessed. We identified 25 risk factors for IBD, seven of which were noted in both Eastern and Western populations: family history of Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC], former smoking (CD/UC), smoking (CD), appendicectomy (CD), tonsillectomy (CD), meat and meat products (CD), and vitamin D deficiency (UC). The remaining factors, including urban living, current smoking, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, caesarean section, isotretinoin, total energy, fat, cholesterol, fatty acids and their sub-classifications, eggs, and soft drinks, were associated with an increased risk of IBD in Western or Eastern populations only. We identified 21 protective factors for IBD, among which eight were common in the East and West: farm animals (CD/UC), Helicobacter pylori infection (CD/UC), multiple births (CD), physical activity (CD), history of breastfeeding (CD), pets (UC), current smoking (UC), and coffee intake (UC). Ten factors conferred protection against IBD in Western populations only, whereas eight factors conferred protection against IBD in Eastern populations only.

34344314,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Real-World Data Rates Of Deep Remission With Anti-Tnfα In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Deep remission (DR) is a treatment target in IBD associated with reduced hospitalization and improved outcome. Randomized control trial (RCT) data demonstrates efficacy of anti-TNFα agents in achieving DR; however, real-world data (RWD) can provide information complementary to RCTs, specifically regarding treatment duration. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we use real-world data (RWD) to determine rates of DR in IBD treated with anti-TNFα.
METHODS: We completed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE on July 8, 2019 with review of major gastrointestinal conference abstracts from 2012 to 2019. Studies utilizing RWD (data not from phase I-III RCTs) of adult IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα agents were included. DR was defined by clinical and endoscopic remission at minimum. DR was assessed at 8 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: 29,033 publications were identified. Fifteen publications, nine manuscripts and six conference abstracts, were included encompassing 1212 patients (769 Crohn's disease-CD, 443 ulcerative colitis-UC), and analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. Rate of DR was 36.4% (95% CI 12.6-69.4%) at 8 weeks, 39.1% (95% CI 10.4-78%) at 6 months, 44.4% (95% CI 34.6-54.6%) at 1 year, and 36% (95% CI 18.7-58%) at 2 years. DR in CD at 1 year was 48.6% (95% CI 32.8-64.7%) and in UC was 43.6% (95% CI 32.8-55.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of DR was highest after 1 year of therapy, in nearly 45% of IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα. Similar rates were achieved between patients with UC and CD. The findings highlight the efficacy of anti-TNFα in real-world setting. Future studies using RWD can determine efficacy of newer IBD therapeutics in routine clinical practice.",Alipour O; Gualti A; Shao L; Zhang B,2021,BMC gastroenterology,21,1,312,10.1186/s12876-021-01883-6,"Alipour, O., Gualti, A., Shao, L., & Zhang, B.

Methods: A systemic search was carried out using PubMed and Web of Science databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We retrieved a total of 349 articles. All the articles were in the English language and investigated the incidence of PCa in patients with IBD. Results: Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 205 037 men. Two studies reported an increase in the risk of PCa in men with IBD in general. Five other studies reported an increased risk of PCa in men with UC or with CD specifically. On the other hand, two studies reported a decreased risk of PCa in patients with UC and patients with IBD treated with aminosalicylates. Conclusions: While men with UC appear to have higher risk of developing PCa, data on patients with CD are inconclusive. Therefore, patients with UC may benefit from earlier PCa screening. Our findings confirm a complex interplay between IBD and PCa, including factors such as genetic predisposition, systemic inflammation and treatment effects. The modulatory effect of treatment strategies for IBD on the development and progression of PCa might be of clinical significance.

34718595,Covid-19 And Outcomes In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Our understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is rapidly evolving. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes in IBD patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Clinicaltrials.gov, Web of Science, MedRxiv, and Google Scholar from inception through October 2020. We included studies with IBD patients and confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected on the prevalence, patient characteristics, pre-infection treatments for IBD, comorbidities, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU), admission, and death.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with 51,643 IBD patients and 1449 with COVID-19 met our inclusion criteria. In 14 studies (n = 50,706) that included IBD patients with and without COVID-19, the prevalence of infection was 1.01% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.10). Of IBD patients with COVID-19, 52.7% had Crohn's disease, 42.2% had ulcerative colitis, and 5.1% had indeterminate colitis. Nine studies (n = 687) reported outcomes according to IBD therapy received. Compared with patients on corticosteroids, those on antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy had a lower risk of hospitalization (risk ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.16-0.35; P < .01; I2 = 0%) and ICU admission (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.37; P < .01) but not death (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.02-1.71; P = .13; I2 = 39%). Compared with patients on mesalamine, those on antitumor necrosis factor therapy had a lower risk of hospitalizations (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.54), ICU admissions (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.58), and death (0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.00). Comparing patients on immunomodulators vs mesalamine or anti-TNF therapy, there was no difference in these outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in IBD patients was low. Use of corticosteroids or mesalamine was significantly associated with worse outcomes, whereas use of anti-TNFs was associated with more favorable outcomes.

37517000,Risk Of Uterine Cervical Cancer In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are limited data on the association between uterine cervical cancer (UCC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the risk of UCC in patients with IBD. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, gray literature and conference proceedings for studies published before 21 January 2022. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analyses were based on IBD type, biologic era, immunosuppression status, study location and design, and publication status. Fifteen studies were included.
RESULTS: The pooled relative risk (RR) of UCC in IBD was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.69; I2 = 53.4%). In subgroup analyses, the pooled RRs of UCC in CD and UC were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.97-1.42) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.01-12.21), respectively. The pooled RRs of UCC in pre-biologic and biologic eras were 1.36 (95% CI, 0.83-2.23) and 1.99 (95% CI, 1.03-3.86), respectively. The pooled RR of UCC in immunomodulator users was 2.18 (95% CI, 0.81-5.87). The pooled RRs of UCC in Asia, Europe and North America were 5.65 (95% CI, 2.65-12.07), 1.13 (95% CI, 0.96-1.34) and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.10-1.73), respectively.

33723700,Effectiveness And Safety Of Ustekinumab In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Ustekinumab, an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 antagonist, is licensed for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) after the phase III trial programs demonstrated efficacy over placebo. However, these findings may not be directly transferable to the real-world due to the stringent inclusion criteria of clinical trials.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the safety and effectiveness of ustekinumab in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A systematic literature search was conducted via Medline and Embase from inception to April 21, 2020. Observational studies assessing ustekinumab's safety and effectiveness by reporting response, remission and/or adverse events (AE) in either CD or UC were included. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias and extracted study data. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to pool rates of clinical response, remission, and safety data.
RESULTS: Following deduplication, 2147 records were identified of which 41 studies (38 CD, 3 UC) comprising 4400 patients were included for quantitative analysis. Pooled clinical remission rates for CD were 34% (95% CI, 26%-42%) following induction and 31% (95% CI, 25%-38%) at one year. For UC, post-induction clinical remission rates were 39% (95% CI, 23%-56%). Serious AEs were reported in 5.6% of patients. Pregnancy outcomes were similar to the general population. One-third of patients with active baseline perianal disease responded or had fistula healing with ustekinumab.
CONCLUSIONS: In the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to date, and the first to include UC, ustekinumab was shown to be effective and safe in the real-world treatment of IBD.",Honap S; Meade S; Ibraheim H; Irving PM; Jones MP; Samaan MA,2022,Digestive diseases and sciences,67,3,1018-1035,10.1007/s10620-021-06932-4,"Honap, S., Meade, S., Ibraheim, H., Irving, P.

38060699,Safety And Efficacy Of Biologic Therapies (Ustekinumab And Vedolizumab) In The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd): A Systematic Review.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), that contribute to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, manifesting as bloody diarrhea, fecal urgency, bloating, cramping, and weight loss. IBD manifests as an exacerbation of these symptoms, which medications with high side effect profiles can manage; consequently, many novel therapies, including biologics such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab, have been developed over the years. This systematic review aims to assess the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab and vedolizumab in treating inflammatory bowel disease based on a comprehensive analysis of relevant studies. A thorough literature search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, post hoc analyses, case reports, observational cohorts, and meta-analyses involving ustekinumab and vedolizumab as treatment in IBD patients. The selected studies were critically evaluated for their methodology, patient characteristics, and outcomes. The analysis involved twelve distinct studies investigating the impact of ustekinumab and vedolizumab on individuals afflicted with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The findings revealed a notable trend: ustekinumab displayed a propensity for yielding higher rates of clinical remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Moreover, one study underscored substantial reductions in endoscopic disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who were on ustekinumab. Similarly, ustekinumab exhibited promising outcomes in CD patients, including swift ultrasound responses and the achievement of transmural remission, particularly among those who were new to biologic treatments. In line with this, vedolizumab demonstrated early and considerable symptomatic improvements when used to treat both UC and CD patients. While both biologics showed promising results in inducing and maintaining remission, cautious monitoring is warranted due to the potential adverse events observed in some cases. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the medications' effects on IBD patients.",Ashraf H; Bodapati A; Hanif A; Okafor DK; Katyal G; Kaur G; Khan S,2023,Cureus,15,11,e48338,10.7759/cureus.48338,"Ashraf, H., Bodapati, A., Hanif, A., Okafor, D.

30994521,Fecal Lactoferrin For Assessment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Persistent disease activity is associated with a poor prognosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Therefore, monitoring of IBD activity can avoid the poor prognosis. Serum biomarkers reflect a summation of systemic host responses rather than being specific for intestinal inflammation. And endoscopic monitoring is invasive, costly, and time consuming. The objective of our study was to perform a meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of fecal lactoferrin (FL) in assessing IBD activity.
METHODS: We systematically searched the databases from inception to May 2018 that evaluated IBD activity. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. The extracted data were pooled using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve model. Random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.
RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 773 IBD patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for assessing ulcerative colitis (UC) activity were 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.92] and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.61-0.93), respectively. And the pooled sensitivity and specificity values for assessing Crohn's disease (CD) activity were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.63-0.78), respectively. The diagnostic performance of the FL assay in the UC patients appeared to be superior to that in the CD patients.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis has found that FL is an inexpensive, simple, stable, and useful screening marker with high sensitivity and modest specificity for assessing IBD activity, appearing to have greater ability to evaluate UC rather than CD.",Dai C; Jiang M; Sun MJ; Cao Q,2020,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,54,6,545-553,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001212,"Dai, C., Jiang, M., Sun, M.

36807832,Efficacy And Safety Of Dual Targeted Therapy For Partially Or Non-Responsive Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review Of The Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Dual targeted therapy (DTT) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic option for select patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are unable to achieve remission with biologic or small molecule monotherapy. We conducted a systematic review of specific DTT combinations in patients with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library to identify articles related to the use of DTT for the treatment of Crohn Disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) published before February 2021.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified comprising 288 patients started on DTT for partially or non-responsive IBD. We identified 14 studies with 113 patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and anti-integrin therapies (i.e., vedolizumab and natalizumab), 12 studies with 55 patients receiving vedolizumab and ustekinumab, nine studies with 68 patients receiving vedolizumab and tofacitinib, five studies with 24 patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and tofacitinib, six studies with 18 patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and ustekinumab, and three studies with 13 patients receiving ustekinumab and tofacitinib.

37528211,Effectiveness And Safety Of Ustekinumab For Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: The use of ustekinumab in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is off-label and the data are limited. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in pediatric IBD.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for studies of ustekinumab in children and adolescents with IBD investigating clinical remission, clinical response, corticosteroid-free (CS-free) remission, endoscopic remission/response, or safety up to March 17, 2023. A random-effects model was used for calculating summary estimates.
RESULTS: Eleven studies, comprising 370 patients were included. For Crohn's disease (CD), the pooled clinical remission rates were 34% (73/204) at 8-16 weeks and 46% (60/129) at 1 year. The pooled CS-free clinical remission rates were 23% (10/44) at 8-16 weeks and 45% (42/96) at 1 year. For ulcerative colitis (UC)/IBD unspecified (IBD-U), the pooled CS-free clinical remission rates were 24% (6/25) at 26 weeks and 46% (16/35) at 1 year. Endoscopic remission was found in 0-37.5% of CD and 63.6% of UC. Serious adverse events were reported in 3.5% of patients. About one half of patients required reduction in dose intervals and 62.75% patients could continue ustekinumab therapy at 1 year or final visit.
CONCLUSIONS: According to low-quality evidence mainly from cohort studies and case series, approximately one half of patients with CD and UC/IBD-U achieved remission at 1 year. Ustekinumab has a reasonable safety profile and dose optimization is frequently required. Data on the long-term benefit and high-quality evidence are still needed.",Fang S; Zhang S; Zhang C; Wang L,2023,Paediatric drugs,25,5,499-513,10.1007/s40272-023-00586-7,"Fang, S., Zhang, S., Zhang, C., & Wang, L.

31591455,The Association Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Prostate Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal malignancies. However, the associations between IBD and prostate cancer (PCa) risk remain conflicting.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) or relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the relationship of IBD and PCa risk.
RESULTS: For cohort studies, the pooled SIR was 1.33 (95% CI = 1.03-1.71). The further subgroup analysis showed that the PCa risk was higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (pooled SIR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08-2.30), but not in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled SIR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.97-1.31). Besides, for the three case-control studies, the results indicated that compared with normal group, the pooled RR of PCa was 1.81 for the patients with IBD (95% CI = 1.43-2.29). In addition, sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust and no significant publication bias were observed.

32463159,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Association Of A Pre-Illness Western Dietary Pattern With The Risk Of Developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have presented conflicting results on Western diets and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to evaluate the role of a pre-illness Western dietary pattern in the development of IBD.
METHODS: The Western dietary pattern was defined as that met at least two of the following, either a high intake of refined grains, red and processed meat, animal protein, animal fats or high-fat dairy products, or with a low consumption of fruit and vegetables. Four medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched to identify all relevant references. Risk estimate and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Nine studies (seven case-control studies and two prospective cohorts) were included, with a total of 1491 IBD cases and 53 089 controls. A Western dietary pattern was associated with a risk of all IBD (relative risk [RR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.37-2.68) and separately with Crohn's disease (CD) (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01-2.93) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.38-3.34). Subgroup analysis by region showed that a Western dietary pattern was associated with the risk of CD and UC for studies performed in Europe (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.44-3.50 for CD; RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.61-4.36 for UC). The pooled RR was 2.26 (95% CI 1.42-3.59) in the pediatric CD subgroup.

33079779,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Risks Of Postoperative Complications With Preoperative Use Of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Biologics In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The preoperative use of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients undergoing surgery has been controversial due to concern for increased risks of postoperative complications. We aimed to determine the effect of preoperative anti-TNF therapy on postoperative complications in IBD patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
METHODS: A literature search of Google Scholar, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL was performed through October 2019. Studies reporting postoperative complication rates of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and IBD-unspecified patients with preoperative anti-TNF treatment undergoing abdominal surgery compared to controls without preoperative anti-TNF treatment were included. The main outcomes measured were overall, infectious, and noninfectious postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Forty-one studies totaling 20 274 patients were included. There was a significant increase in overall complications in all patients treated with anti-TNF vs. controls [odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.25, P = 0.03, I2 = 6%] with an absolute risk increase (ARI) of 5.5% and a number needed to harm (NNH) of 18. There was also a significant increase in infectious complications in CD patients (OR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.02-2.03, P = 0.04, I2 = 49%, ARI = 5.5%, NNH = 20) only. Contrastingly, there was a significant increase in noninfectious complications in all patients (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.13-1.85, P = 0.003, I2 = 8%, ARI = 6.4%, NNH = 16) and UC patients (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.15-2.14, P = 0.005, I2 = 25%, ARI = 8.5%, NNH = 12) only.

STUDY DESIGN: A computerized literature search was performed. The primary outcome was the pooled incidence of cancer in studies reporting the risk as a standardized incidence ratio. The secondary outcomes were the pooled incidence rates of all cancers and site-specific cancers including colorectal cancer and hematologic cancers.
RESULTS: Sixty-six studies reporting outcomes in 38 092 patients were included. The pooled standardized incidence ratio for cancer was 2.39 (P < .0001, 95% CI 2.00-2.86) in IBD. The pooled incidence rates for cancer in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were 0.014 (95% CI 0.0087-0.021) and 0.031 (95% CI 0.018-0.052), respectively.

39203883,Dairy Consumption And Inflammatory Bowel Disease Among Arab Adults: A Case-Control Study And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a complex disease with increasing global incidence and prevalence. Although dairy consumption has been linked to various chronic diseases, its relationship with IBD remains uncertain. Additionally, there is a lack of data on this topic from Arab countries. This study aimed to investigate the association between dairy consumption and IBD through a case-control study among Arab populations, followed by a meta-analysis of available studies.
METHOD: First, we used data from 158 UC patients, 244 CD patients, and 395 controls attending a polyclinic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All participants were aged ≥ 18 years. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of UC and CD for individuals who reported the highest versus the lowest frequencies of dairy consumption. Next, we conducted a meta-analysis, combining our results with those from other eligible studies after searching several databases. We used the I2 statistics to examine statistical heterogeneity across studies and the regression test for funnel plot asymmetry to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: The case-control study showed a negative association between frequent dairy consumption and UC (OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.41, 1.00)) but not CD (OR (95% CI) = 0.97 (0.65, 1.45)). In the meta-analysis, the highest frequencies of dairy consumption were negatively associated with both UC and CD: ORs (95% CIs) = 0.82 (0.68, 0.98) and 0.72 (0.59, 0.87), respectively. A moderate heterogeneity across studies was noticed in the UC meta-analysis (I2 = 59.58%) and the CD meta-analysis (I2 = 41.16%). No publication bias was detected.

35166398,Review Article: Emerging Drug Therapies In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The landscape of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment is rapidly expanding with the development of new therapeutic options.
AIM: To review the mechanisms of action and the available clinical trial data on emerging drug therapies for IBD.
METHODS: Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases were queried up to July 2021 using keywords ""inflammatory bowel disease,"" ""IBD,"" ""Crohn's disease,"" ""ulcerative colitis"" and ""trial,"" ""phase"" and ""study."" In addition, we manually reviewed the grey literature including clinical trial registries and abstracts from major gastroenterology conferences in 2020 and 2021 to include pertinent information.
RESULTS: In ulcerative colitis (UC), phase 2b and/or phase 3 studies met primary endpoints for S1P receptor agonists (estrasimod, ozanimod), anti-IL-23 agent (mirikizumab), anti-lymphocyte trafficking agents (ontamalimab, subcutaneous vedolizumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, filgotinib) and TLR9 agonist (cobitolimod). In Crohn's disease (CD), anti-IL-23 agents (risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, filgotinib) and anti-lymphocyte trafficking agents (ontamalimab, etrolizumab) met primary endpoints in randomised controlled clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: Several new IBD drug therapies have positive efficacy and safety data in early clinical trials, and there are several drugs in the therapeutic pipeline. As more treatments for CD and UC are approved for clinical use, research to assess predictors of response to therapy and head-to-head trials is needed to inform providers on how to best position therapeutic options for patients with IBD.",Grossberg LB; Papamichael K; Cheifetz AS,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,7,789-804,10.1111/apt.16785,"Grossberg, L.

35160159,Surgical Management Of Hemorrhoidal Disease In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review With Proportional Meta-Analysis.,"Surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease (HD) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been considered to be potentially harmful, but the evidence for this is poor. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to reappraise the safety and effectiveness of surgical treatments in this special circumstance. A MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library search was performed to retrieve studies reporting the outcomes of surgical treatment of HD in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). From a total of 2072 citations, 10 retrospective studies including 222 (range, 2-70) patients were identified. Of these, 119 (54%) had CD and 103 (46%) UC. Mean age was between 41 and 49 years (range 14-77). Most studies lacked information on the interval between surgery and the onset of complications. Operative treatments included open or closed hemorrhoidectomy (n = 156 patients (70%)), rubber band ligation (n = 39 (18%)), excision or incision of thrombosed hemorrhoid (n = 14 (6%)), and doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DG-HAL, n = 13 (6%)). In total, 23 patients developed a complication (pooled prevalence, 9%; (95%CI, 3-16%)), with a more than two-fold higher rate in patients with CD compared to UC (11% (5-16%) vs. 5% (0-13%), respectively). Despite the low quality evidence, surgical management of HD in IBD and particularly in CD patients who have failed nonoperative therapy should still be performed with caution and limited to inactive disease. Further studies should determine whether advantages in terms of safety and effectiveness with the use of non-excisional techniques (e.g., DG-HAL) can be obtained in this patient population.",Grossi U; Gallo G; Di Tanna GL; Bracale U; Ballo M; Galasso E; Kazemi Nava A; Zucchella M; Cinetto F; Rattazzi M; Felice C; Zanus G,2022,Journal of clinical medicine,11,3,,10.3390/jcm11030709,"Grossi, U., Gallo, G., Di Tanna, G.

31970610,Systematic Review: Non-Medical Switching Of Infliximab To Ct-P13 In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biosimilar approval, such as InflectraTM (CT-P13) for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), has reduced direct drug costs. Though clinicians are comfortable with biosimilar use in treatment-naïve patients, there are concerns in some jurisdictions that there are insufficient data from well-controlled trials to support non-medical switching. A systematic review, along with a critical assessment of the study design, was conducted to assess the potential impact of switching stable CD/UC patients from infliximab to CT-P13.
METHODS: A literature search using PubMed and abstracts/posters from 3 major gastroenterology conferences from 2014 to 2018 was completed. Two individual reviewers extracted data from each relevant report and compiled it into evidence tables to facilitate descriptive analyses. Key randomized trial and observational study designs were critically assessed to contextualize data relevance.
RESULTS: A total of 49 reports (3 randomized controlled trials, 40 observational trials, and 1 case series) were included. Most studies revealed no efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns with non-medical switch. Limitations of supporting data include a small number of randomized controlled trials; predominance of observational studies with varying outcome assessments and lack of appropriate controls; and scarcity of research on biosimilar switch long-term effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of studies suggested non-medical switch is safe. However, clinicians and regulatory bodies should be aware of differences and limitations in study designs when making inferences about the risks and benefits of switching stable IBD patients to biosimilars.",Bernard EJ; Fedorak RN; Jairath V,2020,Digestive diseases and sciences,65,8,2354-2372,10.1007/s10620-019-06036-0,"Bernard, E.

38449867,Diet-Derived Circulating Antioxidants And Risk Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the impact of circulating antioxidants on the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, our intent was to investigate the causal relationship between circulating antioxidants and IBD using Mendelian randomization (MR).
METHODS: Instrumental variables for absolute circulating antioxidants (ascorbate, retinol, lycopene, and β-carotene) and circulating antioxidant metabolites (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, ascorbate, and retinol) were screened from published studies. We obtained outcome data from two genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases, including the international inflammatory bowel disease genetics consortium (IIBDGC, 14,927 controls and 5,956 cases for Crohn's disease (CD), 20,464 controls and 6,968 cases for ulcerative colitis (UC), and 21,770 controls and 12,882 cases for IBD) and the FinnGen study (375,445 controls and 1,665 cases for CD, 371,530 controls and 5,034 cases for UC, and 369,652 controls and 7,625 cases for IBD). MR analysis was performed in each of the two databases and those results were pooled using meta-analysis to assess the overall effect of exposure on each phenotype. In order to confirm the strength of the findings, we additionally conducted a replication analysis using the UK Biobank.
RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of the IIBDGC and FinnGen, we found that each unit increase in absolute circulating level of retinol was associated with a 72% reduction in the risk of UC (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.78, P=0.015). The UC GWAS data from the UK Biobank also confirmed this causal relationship (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.00, P=0.016). In addition, there was suggestive evidence that absolute retinol level was negatively associated with IBD (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.92, P=0.031). No other causal relationship was found.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide strong evidence that the absolute circulating level of retinol is associated with a reduction in the risk of UC. Further MR studies with more instrumental variables on circulating antioxidants, especially absolute circulating antioxidants, are needed to confirm our results.",Zou M; Liang Q; Zhang W; Liang J; Zhu Y; Xu Y,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1334395,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1334395,"Zou, M., Liang, Q., Zhang, W., Liang, J., Zhu, Y., & Xu, Y.

35379216,Efficacy And Safety Of Vedolizumab For Pediatrics With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab use in pediatrics is still off-label and the data are limited. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for studies of vedolizumab in children and adolescents with IBD reporting clinical remission, response, corticosteroid-free (CS-free) remission, mucosal healing, or safety up to December 3rd 2021.
RESULTS: Ten studies, comprising 455 patients were included. For CD, the pooled clinical remission rates were 25% (19/75) at 6 weeks, 28% (25/85) at 14 weeks, 32% (17/53) at 22 weeks, and 46% (43/92) at 1 year. For UC/IBD-U, the pooled clinical remission rates were 36% (25/70) at 6 weeks, 48% (52/101) at 14 weeks, 53% (24/45) at 22 weeks, and 45% (50/112) at 1 year. Mucosal healing was found in 17%-39% of CD and 15%-34% of UC/IBD-U respectively. Six percent of patients reported serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: According to low-quality evidence based on case series, approximately one-third and one-half of patients for CD and UC/IBD-U respectively achieved remission within 22 weeks, and about half of patients achieved remission at 1 year with reasonable safety profile. Long-term benefit profile data and high quality evidence are still needed.",Fang S; Song Y; Zhang C; Wang L,2022,BMC pediatrics,22,1,175,10.1186/s12887-022-03229-x,"Fang, S., Song, Y., Zhang, C., & Wang, L.

36913311,Effectiveness And Safety Of Vedolizumab In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many observational studies on the use of vedolizumab [VDZ] in patients with Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] have been published in the past few years. We aimed to comprehensively summarise its effectiveness and safety by pooling data only from observational studies.
METHODS: PubMed/Medline and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies on patients with CD and UC treated with VDZ through December 2021. The rates of clinical remission and overall adverse events were the primary outcomes. The rates of steroid-free clinical remission, clinical response, mucosal healing, C-reactive protein normalisation, loss of response, VDZ dose escalation, colectomy, serious adverse events, infections, and malignancies were considered as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: In all, 88 studies comprising 25 678 patients [13 663 with CD and 12 015 with UC] met the inclusion criteria. In patients with CD, the pooled estimate rates of clinical remission were 36% at induction and 39% at maintenance. In patients with UC, the pooled estimate rates of clinical remission were 40% at induction and 45% at maintenance. The pooled estimate of incidence rate of adverse events was 34.6 per 100 person-years. At multivariable meta-regression analysis, studies with increased male proportion were independently associated with higher rates of clinical remission and steroid-free clinical remission at both induction and maintenance, and clinical response at maintenance in patients with CD. Studies with increased disease duration were independently associated with higher mucosal healing rates at maintenance in patients with UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Observational studies demonstrated extensively the effectiveness of VDZ, with a reassuring safety profile.",Macaluso FS; Ventimiglia M; Orlando A,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,8,1217-1227,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad043,"Macaluso, F.

37781953,Vitamin D For The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D possesses immunomodulatory properties and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal studies and emerging epidemiological evidence have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and worse disease activity. However, the role of vitamin D for the treatment of IBD is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for IBD.
SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was Jun 2023.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of all ages with active or inactive IBD comparing any dose of vitamin D with another dose of vitamin D, another intervention, placebo, or no intervention. We defined doses as: vitamin D (all doses), any-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 400 IU/day), high-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 1000 IU/day), low-treatment-dose vitamin D (400 IU/day to 1000 IU/day), and supplemental-dose vitamin D (less than 400 IU/day).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. clinical response for people with active disease, 2. clinical relapse for people in remission, 3. quality of life, and 4. withdrawals due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 5. disease activity at end of study, 6. normalisation of vitamin D levels at end of study, and 7. total serious adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 RCTs with 1874 participants. Study duration ranged from four to 52 weeks. Ten studies enroled people with Crohn's disease (CD), five enroled people with ulcerative colitis (UC), and seven enroled people with CD and people with UC. Seventeen studies included adults, three included children, and two included both. Four studies enroled people with active disease, six enroled people in remission, and 12 enroled both. We assessed each study for risk of bias across seven individual domains. Five studies were at low risk of bias across all seven domains. Ten studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain but with no areas of high risk of bias. Seven studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and assessors. Vitamin D (all doses) versus placebo or no treatment Thirteen studies compared vitamin D against placebo or no treatment. We could not draw any conclusions on clinical response for UC as the certainty of the evidence was very low (risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 10.57; 1 study, 60 participants). There were no data on CD. There may be fewer clinical relapses for IBD when using vitamin D compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96; 3 studies, 310 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on quality of life for IBD (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -3.10 to 2.83 (the SMD value indicates a negligent decrease in quality of life, and the corresponding CIs indicate that the effect can range from a large decrease to a large increase in quality of life); 2 studies, 243 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.27; 12 studies, 1251 participants; note 11 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 12). The certainty of the evidence was very low. High-treatment-dose vitamin D versus low-treatment-dose vitamin D Five studies compared high treatment vitamin D doses against low treatment vitamin D doses. There were no data on clinical response. There may be no difference in clinical relapse for CD (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01; 1 study, 34 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.08; 3 studies, 104 participants; note 2 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 3). The data on quality of life and disease activity could not be meta-analysed, were of very low certainty, and no conclusions could be drawn. Any-treatment-dose vitamin D versus supplemental-dose vitamin D Four studies compared treatment doses of vitamin D against supplemental doses. There were no data on clinical response and relapse. There were no data on quality of life that could be meta-analysed. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.17; 4 studies, 233 participants; note 3 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 4).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There may be fewer clinical relapses when comparing vitamin D with placebo, but we cannot draw any conclusions on differences in clinical response, quality of life, or withdrawals, due to very low-certainty evidence. When comparing high and low doses of vitamin D, there were no data for clinical response, but there may be no difference in relapse for CD. We cannot draw conclusions on the other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence. Finally, comparing vitamin D (all doses) to supplemental-dose vitamin D, there were no data on clinical relapse or response, and we could not draw conclusions on other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence or missing data. It is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research on the basis of the findings of this review. Future studies must be clear on the baseline populations, the purpose of vitamin D treatment, and, therefore, study an appropriate dosing strategy. Stakeholders in the field may wish to reach consensus on such issues prior to new studies.",Wallace C; Gordon M; Sinopoulou V; Limketkai BN,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10,10,CD011806,10.1002/14651858.CD011806.pub2,"Wallace, C., Gordon, M., Sinopoulou, V., & Limketkai, B.

33814999,Training For Minimally Invasive Surgery For Ibd: A Current Need.,"Surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) management has passed through an important evolution over the last decades, with innovative strategies and new technologies, especially in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approaches. MIS procedures for IBD include multiport laparoscopy, single-port surgery, robotics, and the use of transanal platforms. These approaches can be used in the surgical management of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There are significant peculiarities in the surgical field in CD and UC, and their perfect understanding are directly related to better outcomes in IBD patients, as a consequence of improvement in knowledge by IBD surgeons. Different strategies to train colorectal surgeons were developed worldwide, for better application of MIS, usually for malignant or non-IBD benign diseases. There is a significant lack of evidence in specific training strategies for MIS in the IBD field. In this review, the authors outline the importance of adequate surgical training in IBD MIS, by discussing the current evidence on different approaches and emphasizing the need for better training protocols included in multidisciplinary teams in IBD centers throughout the globe.",Kotze PG; Holubar SD; Lipman JM; Spinelli A,2021,Clinics in colon and rectal surgery,34,3,172-180,10.1055/s-0040-1718685,"Kotze, P.

36648528,Dietary Advice For Patients With Bowel-Related Conditions And Malabsorption.,"PURPOSE: To explain the pathophysiology of kidney stone formation and appropriate dietary recommendations in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and after bariatric surgery, focusing on the current literature.
METHODS: A narrative review methodology was performed. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Studies on the relationship between IBD or bariatric surgery and the risk of kidney stone formation were included.
RESULTS: Dietary composition has a critical role in urinary stone formation. Nutritional factors such as fluid intake, dietary protein, carbohydrates, oxalate, and calcium contribute to the risk of stone formation. Bowel-related malabsorptive conditions (IBD, after bariatric surgery, etc.) are associated with an increased risk of kidney stone formation due to metabolic and physiological changes such as hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and decreased fluid intake or absorption. While the risk is lower in restrictive bariatric surgeries, the risk of kidney stone formation increases, especially after malabsorptive procedures. Dietary recommendations for these patients could profit alleviate urinary changes and reduce the risk of kidney stones.
CONCLUSION: Bowel-related malabsorptive conditions such as IBD and bariatric surgery are associated with an increased risk of kidney stones. Appropriate dietary recommendations can improve urinary metabolic changes and reduce kidney stone formation and the possibility of stone-related surgery.",İbis MA; Oktar A; Gokce MI,2023,World journal of urology,41,5,1235-1242,10.1007/s00345-023-04281-7,"İbis, M.

38021365,Therapeutic Advancement In Inflammatory Bowel Disease By Incorporating Plant-Based Diet.,"Identification and recognition of the ubiquitous environmental factor are prerequisite for treatment and prevention of the disease. The biggest problem with current practice in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor for the disease. The incidence of IBD is associated with dietary transition from a traditional diet to the current (westernized) diet. Prospective cohort studies and case-control studies indicate that the current diet is a risk factor for IBD. The current diet tends to cause gut microbial dysbiosis resulting in a pro-inflammatory state. Therefore, we regard our current diet as this factor. Even nutritionally balanced meals are unable to suppress relapse, particularly in Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore, we developed a plant-based diet (PBD) (lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet) to counter the current diet. By incorporating the PBD into practice, we achieved far better outcomes in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and CD in both the induction and quiescent phases compared to the current standard therapy. All patients were treated on an inpatient basis and provided with a PBD. CD is far more untenable than UC and is destined to follow a disabling course. Therefore, infliximab was indicated in all patients with CD, but only in severe cases with UC. This infliximab and PBD as first-line (IPF) therapy broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics (around 30%): the remission rate was 96% (44/46) in CD and 76% (13/17) in severe UC. A PBD can induce remission without medication in approximately one-third of mild cases of UC. All patients were advised to adhere PBD after discharge. In CD, a relapse-free outcome was achieved in nearly a half of patients (52%) at 10-year follow-up without biologics or immunosuppressants. Cumulative relapse rates for 51 initial episode cases of UC (18 mild, 30 moderate, 3 severe) at 1 and 5 years were 14% and 27%, respectively. We believe our assertion that the current diet is the ubiquitous environmental factor underlying IBD is correct and a PBD is right diet for the disease.",Chiba M; Tsuji T; Komatsu M,2023,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,8,,38,10.21037/tgh-23-6,"Chiba, M., Tsuji, T., & Komatsu, M.

34335253,Natural Anti-Inflammatory Compounds As Drug Candidates For Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents chronic recurrent intestinal inflammation resulting from various factors. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been identified as the two major types of IBD. Currently, most of the drugs for IBD used commonly in the clinic have adverse reactions, and only a few drugs present long-lasting treatment effects. Moreover, issues of drug resistance and disease recurrence are frequent and difficult to resolve. Together, these issues cause difficulties in treating patients with IBD. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of IBD is of significance. In this context, research on natural compounds exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity could be a novel approach to developing effective therapeutic strategies for IBD. Phytochemicals such as astragalus polysaccharide (APS), quercetin, limonin, ginsenoside Rd, luteolin, kaempferol, and icariin are reported to be effective in IBD treatment. In brief, natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activities are considered important candidate drugs for IBD treatment. The present review discusses the potential of certain natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives in the prevention and treatment of IBD.",Duan L; Cheng S; Li L; Liu Y; Wang D; Liu G,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,684486,10.3389/fphar.2021.684486,"Duan, L., Cheng, S., Li, L., Liu, Y., Wang, D., & Liu, G.

34678692,Peripheral Blood Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio In Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Disease Activity: A Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a valuable predictor of clinical disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical significance of peripheral blood NLR in IBD patients.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases from inception to May 10, 2021. We used the standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the pooled effect and subgroup analysis to investigate heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies including 2185 IBD patients and 993 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. The peripheral blood NLR values were significantly higher in 1,092 IBD patients than in 933 HCs (SMD = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05-2.02, P < 0.001) and in 1,269 patients with active IBD than in 1,056 patients with remissive IBD (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.06-2.05, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of the major subtypes of IBD revealed significantly elevated peripheral blood NLR values in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) compared to HCs (SMD = 2.04), remissive UC than HCs (SMD = 0.63), and active UC than in those with remissive UC (SMD = 1.32) (P < 0.05). Both Crohn's disease (CD) patients and active CD patients had significantly elevated peripheral blood NLR values than HCs with the SMD of 0.52 and 3.53 (P < 0.001).

37543401,When And Where Should Surgery Be Positioned In Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease?,"Surgery for children and adolescents with IBD is often thought of as a combination of a failure of medical management and the only option for the severe complications of the disease such as uncontrolled GI bleeding, perforation, fistulae, sepsis, and bowel obstruction. However, in CD, surgery can sometimes be an appropriate option to control disease progression, improve symptoms, allow children to get back on the growth curve, and avoid the toxicities of prolonged use of steroids. In UC, the decision to operate is theoretically curative but the long-term options mandate either intestinal continuity with an ileal pouch or a lifelong ileostomy, both of which can have significant impacts in patients' quality of life.",Lipskar AM,2023,Gastroenterology clinics of North America,52,3,579-587,10.1016/j.gtc.2023.06.001,"Lipskar, A.

35662873,The Role Of Vitamin D In Immune System And Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a nonspecific inflammatory disease that includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis of IBD is not fully understood but is most reported associated with immune dysregulation, dysbacteriosis, genetic susceptibility, and environmental risk factors. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the human body, and it not only regulates bone metabolism but also the immune system, the intestinal microbiota and barrier. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in IBD patients, and the abnormal low levels of vitamin D are highly correlated with disease activity, treatment response, and risk of relapse of IBD. Accumulating evidence supports the protective role of vitamin D in IBD through regulating the adaptive and innate immunity, maintaining the intestinal barrier and balancing the gut microbiota. This report aims to provide a broad overview of the role vitamin D in the immune system, especially in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD, and its possible role in predicting relapse.",Wu Z; Liu D; Deng F,2022,Journal of inflammation research,15,,3167-3185,10.2147/JIR.S363840,"Wu, Z., Liu, D., & Deng, F.

33114313,Microrna Biomarkers In Ibd-Differential Diagnosis And Prediction Of Colitis-Associated Cancer.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These are chronic autoimmune diseases of unknown etiology affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The IBD population includes a heterogeneous group of patients with varying disease courses requiring personalized treatment protocols. The complexity of the disease often delays the diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate treatments. In a subset of patients, IBD leads to colitis-associated cancer (CAC). MicroRNAs are single-stranded regulatory noncoding RNAs of 18 to 22 nucleotides with putative roles in the pathogenesis of IBD and colorectal cancer. They have been explored as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Both tissue-derived and circulating microRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers in the differential diagnosis and in the prognosis of disease severity of IBD as well as predictive biomarkers in drug resistance. In addition, knowledge of the cellular localization of differentially expressed microRNAs is a prerequisite for deciphering the biological role of these important epigenetic regulators and the cellular localization may even contribute to an alternative repertoire of biomarkers. In this review, we discuss findings based on RT-qPCR, microarray profiling, next generation sequencing and in situ hybridization of microRNA biomarkers identified in the circulation and in tissue biopsies.",James JP; Riis LB; Malham M; Høgdall E; Langholz E; Nielsen BS,2020,International journal of molecular sciences,21,21,,10.3390/ijms21217893,"James, J.

40237230,Global Prevalence Of Biologic Drugs Use In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Biologics are increasingly essential in managing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) worldwide, as they can modify disease progression and improve patients' quality of life. This study aimed to analyze the global prevalence of and geographic variations in the use of biological drugs for IBD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published up to 21 July 2024, were identified from the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, IBECS, WPRIM, BRISA/RedETSA and LILACS databases. Population-based studies (cohort, case-control and cross-sectional) and studies using administrative databases with data on the prevalence of biological medicine use in patients with IBD were included. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, whereas heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and I2.
RESULTS: Of the 8239 titles, 68 (n = 3,482,385 patients) were included. An increase in the number of studies on the subject has been reported since 2017, and these studies have been mostly concentrated in high-income countries. A 15.06% (95% CI 11.84-18.28%) prevalence of biologic use in IBD worldwide was reported, predominantly concentrated in the use of anti-TNF agents 15.01% (95% CI 10.35-19.67%). Furthermore, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) had a greater prevalence of biologic use (21.41%; 95% CI 16.31-26.50%) than ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (9.70%; 95% CI 6.20-13.18%).
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies using population-based and administrative data and stratifying their analyses by disease type are required to confirm our findings.

36694316,Impact Of Vitamin D On The Occurrence And Development Of Intestinal Diseases: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"AIM: To determine the impact of vitamin D on the occurrence and progression of intestinal disorders, the authors of this study have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
BACKGROUND: Vitamin D regulates inflammation and immunity in association with reducing the disease symptoms of several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the exact role of vitamin D in the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases is unclear so far.
METHODOLOGY: The relevant studies were searched in PubMed and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of full-text studies was assessed using National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH) scale. The study was conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. The overall estimate was calculated in terms of risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval. The publication bias was assessed qualitatively using a funnel plot, and heterogeneity among studies was calculated using I2 statistics. All analyses were done using RevMan 5.0.
RESULTS: The overall risk ratio using random effect model was found to be 0.89 (0.70, 1.12), which indicates the non-significant role of vitamin D in the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases as compared to the non-vitamin D group. However, after exclusion of studies with low and high sample sizes, a significant reduction in intestinal diseases was observed in the vitamin D group as compared to the non-vitamin D group. Further, no heterogeneity among the studies was observed.
CONCLUSION: Based on available evidence, vitamin D might play a significant role in the reduction of intestinal diseases; however, more studies with high sample sizes are required to draw a valid conclusion.",Liu J; Wang Y; Zou Y; Li C,2023,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,26,12,2247-2258,10.2174/1386207326666230123151617,"Liu, J., Wang, Y., Zou, Y., & Li, C.

33850767,Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Risk Of Urinary Cancers: A Systematic Review And Pooled Analysis Of Population-Based Studies.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to elucidate the risk of urologic cancers in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science, and manual retrieval were conducted from inception to June 2020. Two reviewers independently searched the above databases and selected the studies using prespecified standardized criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies, and this meta-analysis was completed by STATA version 14.2.
RESULTS: A total of 12 cohort studies and 4 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were at significantly increased risk of renal cancer (RCa) [standardized incidence ratio (SIR): 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25-1.80; I2=42.4%], but not at increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa), bladder cancer (BCa) and male genital cancer. In the subgroup analysis, CD patients had a significantly higher RCa risk (SIR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.45-2.44; I2=39.9%). Besides, CD patients seemed to be at borderline significantly increased risks of PCa (SIR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.93-1.20; I2=15.1%) and BCa (SIR:1.19; 95% CI: 0.94-1.44; I2=0%), and UC patients seemed to be at borderline significantly increased risks of RCa (SIR:1.31; 95% CI: 0.94-1.67; I2=48.0%) and PCa (SIR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.93-1.33; I2=73.5%). Notably, we observed that IBD patients in Eastern countries have significantly increased PCa risk (SIR: 2.66; 95% CI: 1.52-3.81; I2=13.6%), especially for UC patients (SIR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.75-4.27; I2=0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that IBD patients with special reference to CD patients increase the risk of RCa. Besides, IBD patients in Asian countries have significantly increased risk of PCa, especially for UC patients. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the potential mechanism of RCa associated with IBD and the differences of the risk of urinary cancers between Eastern and Western countries.",Feng D; Yang Y; Wang Z; Wei W; Li L,2021,Translational andrology and urology,10,3,1332-1341,10.21037/tau-20-1358,"Feng, D., Yang, Y., Wang, Z., Wei, W., & Li, L.

35510325,Efficacy And Safety Of Fecal Microbiota Transplant For Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the outcomes of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
METHODS: electronic databases were searched for studies reporting on the efficacy and/or safety of FMT therapy for recurrent CDI in IBD. The meta-prop command of the meta package in R was used to assess efficacy and safety. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity regarding all outcomes.
RESULTS: eleven trials were included in the study. A pooled analysis showed that the initial cure rate of recurrent CDI among IBD patients was 80 % (95 % CI, 0.76, 0.84), and the overall cure rate after two or more FMT procedures was 90 % (95 % CI, 0.84, 0.94). The recurrence rate post-FMT therapy was 25 % (95 % CI: 0.20, 0.32). Sub-analyses suggested that the initial cure rate of CDI in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was higher than in Crohn's disease (CD) patients (85 % vs. 79 %), with no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). No serious adverse events were noted in any of the patients post-FMT.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT is an effective and safe treatment for recurrent CDI in patients with IBD. FMT should be considered early in cases of recurrent or refractory CDI. Multiple FMT procedures can improve the cure rate of CDI.",Cheng F; Huang Z; Li Z; Wei W,2022,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas,114,9,543-549,10.17235/reed.2022.8814/2022,"Cheng, F., Huang, Z., Li, Z., & Wei, W.

36984772,Incorporation Of Plant-Based Diet Surpasses Current Standards In Therapeutic Outcomes In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"There has been no study of the therapeutic effect of a plant-based diet (PBD) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) except for our studies in Japan. In this review, we describe the rationale for the requirement of PBD in IBD and the outcomes of our modality incorporating PBD together with a literature review. The biggest problem in current therapy for IBD is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor in IBD. Therefore, a radical strategy against IBD has not been established. Japanese data showed an increased incidence of IBD in association with dietary westernization. Current global consumption consists of an excess of unhealthy foods and a shortage of healthy foods recognized as pro-inflammatory. Patients with IBD are no exception. One of the recommended healthy reference diets is PBD recognized as anti-inflammatory. We assert that IBD occurs in susceptible individuals mainly as a result of our omnivorous (westernized) diet. Therefore, we developed and began to provide a PBD, a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for IBD patients in 2003. Infliximab and PBD as first-line (IPF) therapy was administered for all patients with newly developed Crohn's disease (CD) and for severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Our modality broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics, with a remission rate of 96% in CD, and created a new relapse-free course in slightly over half of the patients (52%) with CD. Based on the rationale derived from available evidence and the clinical outcomes, PBD is highly recommended for IBD.",Chiba M; Morita N,2023,Metabolites,13,3,,10.3390/metabo13030332,"Chiba, M., & Morita, N.

39685485,Optimal Management Of Patients With Moderate-To-Severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic and often debilitating condition requiring complex and individualized management. Over the past few decades, advancements in understanding IBD pathophysiology have led to a transformative shift in therapeutic approaches. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of IBD treatments, from early symptom-focused therapies to modern biologics, small molecule agents, and emerging treatment strategies. We discuss therapeutic goals centered on achieving clinical remission, endoscopic/mucosal healing, and enhancing patient quality of life. Additionally, we explore the rationale for the early and personalized use of biologic therapies in moderate-to-severe cases, review the current FDA-approved agents as of 2024, and highlight the advantages and limitations of these treatments. Special attention is given to the evolving role of novel oral therapies, including Janus kinase inhibitors and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and future new directions.

32545154,Incidence Of Prostate Cancer In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Background and objectives: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as some extra-intestinal tumors, but there are still limited data about the risk of prostate cancer (PC). To analyze if there is an increased risk of PC in patients affected by IBD, we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis. Materials and Methods: A Pubmed search of all studies comparing standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risks (RR) of PC between IBD and non IBD groups, published until March 2020 was conducted. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO. Twelve studies, mostly population studies, were included. The quality score of these studies, evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, was 7. The heterogeneity was high among the studies in which ulcerative colitis (UC) was considered separate from Crohn's disease (CD) and in the studies that considered UC and CD together (""IBD-studies""), while it was low in the studies which considered CD separate from UC. Results: The relative risk of developing PC was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.51, p = 0.007) in IBD, 1.10 (95%CI 0.98-1.25, p = 0.116) in CD, and 1.22 (95%CI 0.98-1.51, p = 0.07) in UC.

37632227,The Association Of Ultra-Processed Food Consumption With Adult Inflammatory Bowel Disease Risk: A Systematic Review And Dose-Response Meta-Analysis Of 4 035 694 Participants.,"CONTEXT: There is an inconsistency between the results obtained from observational studies regarding intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
OBJECTIVES: A dose-response meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between UPF intake and the risk of IBD.
DATA SOURCES: Searches were performed in the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to November 2, 2022.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were available from 24 studies including a total of 4 035 694 participants from 20 countries.
DATA ANALYSIS: Risk ratios for IBD were analyzed by a random-effects model. Outcomes indicated that UPF intake was linked to an increased risk of IBD (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95%CI, 1.06-1.21; P = 0.001; I2 = 73.2%; n = 59; N = 4 035 694). This association was significant, especially for the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (RR, 1.19; 95%CI, 1.00-1.41; I2 = 78.2%; P = 0.046; n = 23; N = 2 167 160), unlike the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR = 1.11; 95%CI, 0.99-1.26; P = 0.085; I2 = 60.3%; n = 27; N = 2 167 918). Also, results revealed that each 10% enhancement in daily UPF intake was not related to the risk of IBD (RR, 1.05; 95%CI, 0.98-1.14; P = 0.168; I2 = 31.9%; n = 4) or the risk of UC (RR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.92-1.11; P = 0.876; I2 = 34.7%; n = 2) in adults. However, results suggested that for every 10% increase in daily UPF intake, there was a 19% increase in the risk of CD (RR, 1.19; 95%CI, 1.01-1.32; P = 0.021; I2 = 0.0%; n = 2) among adults. In addition, the results showed a positive linear relation between UPF intake with CD risk (Pnonlinearity = 0.431; Pdose response = 0.049) but not risk of IBD or UC.
CONCLUSION: High intake of UPFs was linked with an enhanced IBD risk, a specific risk of CD. However, conducting more observational studies among several ethnicities and using specific tools that accurately assess the amount of UPF consumption, components of UPFs, and food additives may be necessary.

37634654,Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring For Cardiovascular Risk Assessment In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with higher incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Data investigating the role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in identifying subclinical atherosclerotic disease in IBD patients is scarce.
METHODS: Using data obtained from the CLARIFY registry, a prospective study of no-charge coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing at University Hospitals, we reviewed patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who underwent CAC scoring from 2014 to 2020. We investigated the concordance between CAC risk and 10-year estimated ASCVD risk by AHA/ACC pooled cohort equation using pre-established thresholds for statin prescription (CAC≥100, 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%). We additionally investigated the association between CAC, preventive therapy initiation and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).
RESULTS: A total of 369 patients with IBD were included (174 UC, 195 CD), with median age of 60 years. The median CAC score was 14.9 with no significant difference between UC and CD (P = .76). Overall, 151 (41%) had CAC of 0, 108 (29%) had CAC 1-99, 61 (17%) had CAC 100 to 399, and 49 (13%) had CAC ≥400 with no difference in CAC distribution between CD and UC (P = .17). There was no difference in median CAC between IBD or age/sex-matched controls (P = .34). Approximately half of the patients (52%) with IBD had 10-year estimated ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. Among patients with ASCVD risk <7.5% (n = 163), 29 (18%) had CAC≥100 and among patients with ASCVD risk ≥7.5% (n = 178), 102 (57%) had CAC <100. There was no difference between CAC<100 vs CAC≥100 with respect to CRP, use of immunosuppressive or amino-salicylate therapy, IBD severity or complications. CAC score (AUROC 0.67 [0.56-0.78]), but not PCE ASCVD risk (AUROC 0.60 [0.48-0.73]), was predictive of MACE.

35448412,Cytotoxicity Of Thiopurine Drugs In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"The effectiveness of thiopurine drugs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was confirmed more than a half-century ago. It was proven that these can be essential immunomodulatory medications. Since then, they have been used routinely to maintain remission of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The cytotoxic properties of thiopurines and the numerous adverse effects of the treatment are controversial. However, the research subject of their pharmacology, therapy monitoring, and the search for predictive markers are still very relevant. In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge and findings in the field of thiopurines in IBD, focusing on the aspect of their cytotoxicity. Due to thiopurines' benefits in IBD therapy, it is expected that they will still constitute an essential part of the CD and UC treatment algorithm. More studies are still required on the modulation of the action of thiopurines in combination therapy and their interaction with the gut microbiota.",Zakerska-Banaszak O; Łykowska-Szuber L; Walczak M; Żuraszek J; Zielińska A; Skrzypczak-Zielińska M,2022,Toxics,10,4,,10.3390/toxics10040151,"Zakerska-Banaszak, O., Łykowska-Szuber, L., Walczak, M., Żuraszek, J., Zielińska, A., & Skrzypczak-Zielińska, M.

37530507,Astragalus Membranaceus As A Drug Candidate For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The Preclinical Evidence.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders that include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Today, IBD has no successful treatment. As a result, it is of paramount importance to develop novel therapeutic agents for IBD prevention and treatment. Astragalus membranaceus (AMS) is a traditional Chinese medicine found in the AMS root. Modern pharmacological studies indicate that AMS and its constituents exhibit multiple bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, immune regulatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, expectorant, and diuretic effects. AMS and its active constituents, which have been reported to be effective in IBD treatment, are believed to be viable candidate drugs for IBD treatment. These underlying mechanisms are associated with anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, immunomodulation, intestinal epithelial repair, gut microbiota homeostasis, and improved energy metabolism. In this review, we summarize the efficacy and underlying mechanisms involved in IBD treatment with AMS and its active constituents in preclinical studies.",Hou M; Leng Y; Shi Y; Tan Z; Min X,2023,The American journal of Chinese medicine,51,6,1501-1526,10.1142/S0192415X23500684,"Hou, M., Leng, Y., Shi, Y., Tan, Z., & Min, X.

33186988,"Association Of Dietary Fiber, Fruit, And Vegetable Consumption With Risk Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","No previous investigation has summarized findings from prospective cohort studies on the association between dietary intake of fiber, fruit, and vegetables and risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dietary fiber and its major sources can influence the risk of IBD by modulation of the gut microbiota. This study summarizes findings from published cohort studies on the association between dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable consumption and risk of IBD. Relevant articles published up to January 2019 were searched via PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. All prospective cohort studies investigating the association between dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake and risk of IBD were included. Combining 7 effect sizes from 6 studies, no significant association was found between dietary intake of fiber and risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.34). However, a significant inverse association was found between dietary fiber intake and risk of Crohn disease (CD) (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.74), based on 5 studies with 6 effect sizes. Pooling information from 4 studies, we found a significant protective association between dietary intake of fruit and risk of UC (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.86) and CD (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.58). We also found a significant inverse association between vegetable consumption and risk of UC (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.66) and CD (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.59).

35010879,Nutritional Therapies And Their Influence On The Intestinal Microbiome In Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with numerous genetic and environmental risk factors. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) often demonstrate marked disruptions of their gut microbiome. The intestinal microbiota is strongly influenced by diet. The association between the increasing incidence of IBD worldwide and increased consumption of a westernized diet suggests host nutrition may influence the progression or treatment of IBD via the microbiome. Several nutritional therapies have been studied for the treatment of CD and UC. While their mechanisms of action are only partially understood, existing studies do suggest that diet-driven changes in microbial composition and function underlie the diverse mechanisms of nutritional therapy. Despite existing therapies for IBD focusing heavily on immune suppression, nutrition is an important treatment option due to its superior safety profile, potentially low cost, and benefits for growth and development. These benefits are increasingly important to patients. In this review, we will describe the clinical efficacy of the different nutritional therapies that have been described for the treatment of CD and UC. We will also describe the effects of each nutritional therapy on the gut microbiome and summarize the strength of the literature with recommendations for the practicing clinician.",Hart L; Verburgt CM; Wine E; Zachos M; Poppen A; Chavannes M; Van Limbergen J; Pai N,2021,Nutrients,14,1,,10.3390/nu14010004,"Hart, L., Verburgt, C.

40507107,The Association Between Fast Food Consumption And Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Case-Control Study And Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic conditions influenced by various factors, including diet. This study examined the association between fast food consumption and IBD risk through a case-control study and a meta-analysis of epidemiological evidence. Methods: We analyzed data from a hospital-based case-control study conducted in Riyadh. The study included 158 UC patients, 244 CD patients, and 395 controls without IBD. Fast food consumption was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire distributed before diagnoses were made. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of UC and CD for individuals who reported daily fast food consumption. Then, we merged our results with those from other studies investigating the same association into a meta-analysis. Results: In the case-control study, daily consumption of fast food was strongly associated with UC and CD among Saudi people: age- and sex-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) = 6.29 (3.89, 10.16) and 5.92 (3.98, 8.80), respectively. The associations remained robust after further adjustments: ORs (95% CIs) = 6.61 (3.93, 11.12) and 5.90 (3.89, 8.94), respectively. Similarly, the meta-analysis revealed higher odds of fast food intake associated with UC and CD, with pooled odds ratios (95% CIs) of 2.41 (1.07, 5.45) and 2.65 (1.23, 5.70), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential role of fast food consumption in the development of IBD.

38937216,"Bariatric Surgery In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Comparative Analysis Of 450,000 Patients.","BACKGROUND: Studies were conducted to investigate the outcomes of bariatric surgery (BS) among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze previous literature, comparing the outcomes of BS between IBD and non-IBD patients.
SETTING: Not applicable.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched on 25/9/2023 for comparative studies on outcomes of BS in IBD patients. RevMan Software v5.4 was used to conduct the analysis.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed an insignificant difference in the change of body mass index (BMI) at 1-year post-BS between IBD and non-IBD patients. IBD patients had a higher risk of acute renal failure, hemorrhage, and readmission following BS (RR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.55-3, RR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.22-2.04, RR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.17-2.08, respectively). No significant difference was observed between both groups regarding wounds, leak/intra-abdominal infection, thromboembolic complications, and bowel obstruction. A higher incidence of postoperative complications was seen among IBD patients undergoing RYGB compared with SG (RR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.43-3.41). There was a significant decline in steroid use following BS in IBD patients (RR: .67, 95% CI: .53-.84). Comparison between UC and Crohn's disease (CD) revealed insignificant differences in treatment escalation or de-escalation. Both IBD and non-IBD patients had similar lengths of hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: BS is equally effective in IBD and non-IBD patients in terms of weight loss at 1-year follow-up. Nevertheless, IBD patients are at a higher risk of postoperative complications, micronutrient deficiency, and readmission. Both UC and CD reported a decline in steroid use following surgery without a preferential advantage to a particular IBD sub-type.",Dean YE; Mohamed MI; Nassar M; Almadani Y; Soliman Z; Tarek N; Zein M; Yakout A; Hamza A; Elnemr MM; Abdelbaki TN,2024,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,20,11,1119-1129,10.1016/j.soard.2024.05.008,"Dean, Y.

34201630,Role Of Intestinal Ultrasound In The Management Of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) has gained popularity as a first line technique for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) due to its many advantages. It is a non-invasive imaging technique with non-ionizing radiation exposure. It can be easily performed not only by radiologists but also by trained gastroenterologists at outpatient clinics. In addition, the cost of IUS equipment is low when compared with other imaging techniques. IUS is an accurate technique to detect inflammatory lesions and complications in the bowel in patients with suspected or already known Crohn's disease (CD). Recent evidence indicates that IUS is a convenient and accurate technique to assess extension and activity in the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and can be a non-invasive alternative to endoscopy. In patients with IBD, several non-specific pathological ultrasonographic signs can be identified: bowel wall thickening, alteration of the bowel wall echo-pattern, loss of bowel stratification, increased vascularization, decreased bowel peristalsis, fibro-fatty proliferation, enlarged lymph nodes, and/or abdominal free fluid. Considering the transmural CD inflammation, CD complications such as presence of strictures, fistulae, or abscesses can be detected. In patients with UC, where inflammation is limited to mucosa, luminal inflammatory ultrasonographic changes are similar to those of CD. As the technique is related to the operator's experience, adequate IUS training, performance in daily practice, and a generalized use of standardized parameters will help to increase its reproducibility.",Jauregui-Amezaga A; Rimola J,2021,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",11,7,,10.3390/life11070603,"Jauregui-Amezaga, A., & Rimola, J.

However, the growing number of therapeutic options has also complicated clinical decision-making regarding drug selection and switching. The overall performance of IL-23 p19 inhibitors for the treatment of IBD was evaluated by the systematic review and meta-analysis in this study.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to combine the multiple indicators to accurately evaluate the efficacy and safety of IL-23 p19 inhibitors, aimed to offer an insight into the development of clinical physicians' medication.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library until June 2024 was conducted in this study, which mainly focused on the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the IL-23 p19 inhibitors within adult patients with UC or CD. Additionally, the clinical outcomes, endoscopic findings, histological assessments, and safety profiles were aggregated and subjected to analysis by a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs [15 CD, 10 UC] were involved in this study, and it was revealed that IL-23 p19 inhibitors showed significant effects on clinical remission (CR) in IBD, regardless of induction or maintenance treatment (CD, induction: risk ratio [RR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-2.23; I2 = 0%, p = 0.68; UC, induction: RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.80-4.03; I2 = 50%, p = 0.09; CD, maintenance: RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48; I2 = 0%, p = 0.57; UC, maintenance: RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.92-7.49; I2 = 42%, p = 0.19), and the risk of adverse events (AEs) was similar to that of placebo (CD, induction: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.94; I2 = 2%, p = 0.41; UC, induction: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.03; I2 = 0%, p = 0.54; CD, maintenance: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13; I2 = 29%, p = 0.25; UC, maintenance: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06; I2 = 0%, p = 0.44).

40041882,Bidirectional Association Between Oral Diseases Caused By Plaque And The Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The bidirectional association between oral diseases caused by plaque and the inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to August 2024 to identify relevant studies. The relative risk (RR) from periodontal disease studies and the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index from caries-related studies was pooled, and calculating 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and cumulative meta-analysis were employed to evaluate the robustness of the findings. The research adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, incorporating 26 studies for systematic review and 20 for meta-analysis. The results indicated no significant increase in the overall risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with periodontal disease (RR 1.31, 95 % CI 0.98-1.35); however, the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) was higher compared to controls (RR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.04-1.73). Among IBD patients, the risk of periodontal disease was significantly elevated (RR 2.14, 95 % CI 1.62-2.81), as was the risk of dental caries (WMD = 2.51, 95 % CI 0.97-4.06). Additionally, UC patients exhibited a higher incidence of caries compared to Crohn's disease (CD) patients (WMD = 3.97, 95 % CI 1.94-6.00). Sensitivity analyses and cumulative meta-analyses confirmed the stability of the results. In conclusion, IBD patients, particularly those with UC, should prioritize stringent oral hygiene to mitigate the risks of periodontal disease and dental caries.

39583912,18F-Fdg-Pet And Other Imaging Modalities In The Diagnosis And Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which encompasses ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that presents complex diagnostic and management challenges. Early detection and treatment of IBD is paramount, as IBD can present with serious complications, including bowel perforation, arthritis, and colorectal cancer. Most forms of diagnosis and therapeutic management, like ileocolonoscopy and upper endoscopy are highly invasive and require extensive preparation at great discomfort to patients. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) imaging can be a potential solution to the current limitations in imaging for IBD. This review explores the utility and limitations of various imaging modalities used to detect and manage IBD including ileocolonoscopy, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), gastrointestinal ultrasound (IUS), and 18F-FDG-PET/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (18F-FDG-PET/MR).

40277893,Inflammation-Associated Carcinogenesis In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Features And Molecular Mechanisms.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic condition marked by persistent intestinal inflammation of unknown etiology. Disease onset involves genetic predisposition and environmental factors that disrupt the intestinal immune homeostasis. The intestinal microbiome and immune response play pivotal roles in disease progression. Advances in molecular therapies and early interventions have reduced surgery rates; however, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant concern, driven by chronic inflammation. In UC, the risk of UC-associated neoplasia (UCAN) increases with disease duration, while CD patients face elevated risks of small intestine, anal fistula, and anal canal cancers. Endoscopic surveillance is advised for UCAN, but optimal screening intervals remain undefined, and no established guidelines exist for CD-associated cancers. UCAN morphology often complicates detection due to its flat, inflammation-blended appearance, which differs pathologically from sporadic CRC (sCRC). UCAN is frequently surrounded by dysplasia, with p53 mutations evident at the dysplasia stage. IBD-associated gastrointestinal cancers exemplify inflammation-driven carcinogenesis with distinct molecular mechanisms from the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. This review explores the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical and pathological features, current surveillance practices, and molecular pathways underlying inflammation-associated cancers in IBD.",Hisamatsu T; Miyoshi J; Oguri N; Morikubo H; Saito D; Hayashi A; Omori T; Matsuura M,2025,Cells,14,8,,10.3390/cells14080567,"Hisamatsu, T., Miyoshi, J., Oguri, N., Morikubo, H., Saito, D., Hayashi, A., Omori, T., & Matsuura, M.

40662074,Effectiveness And Safety Of Non-Pharmacological Therapies For The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic, inflammatory, and immune-mediated disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. If left inadequately treated, IBD can lead to disease progression, resulting in severe long-term complications, including irreversible structural damage to the intestinal tissues. While clinical symptoms are traditionally used to assess treatment efficacy, they do not always align with the underlying mucosal inflammation, particularly in CD. This limitation underscores the importance of exploring alternative treatment strategies. To address this gap, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments (NPTs) for IBD through a network meta-analysis (NMA), providing a thorough assessment of the available evidence.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Springer, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science, comparing various NPTs for IBD, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), diet interventions (DI), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), physical training (PT), and acupuncture and moxibustion (APMX). Outcomes assessed included clinical remission, disease activity, quality of life (QOL), serum biomarkers (fecal calprotectin [FC] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), and adverse effects. The quality assessment was assessed by Cochrane Handbook and GRADEpro software. The risk ratio (RR) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes while standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for continuous variables with 95% credible intervals (CI). Funnel plot was performed to evaluate publication bias. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was conducted to rank the included interventions. Data were analyzed with STATA 15.0 and Review Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: A total of 62 eligible RCTs were identified in this NMA. The results showed that standard medical therapy (SMT) exhibited the highest probability in inducing clinical remission, as expected. Among non-pharmacological interventions, APMX, a traditional Chinese medicine involving acupuncture and moxibustion, showed promising results in both animal models and clinical trials, reducing serum TNF-α levels and improving intestinal health. DI was most effective in maintaining clinical remission and reducing serum FC levels. FMT emerged as the most effective treatment for reducing serum CRP levels and ranked second in terms of clinical remission induction.
CONCLUSION: APMX, DI, and FMT represent promising non-pharmacological options for managing IBD. APMX was the most effective for clinical remission and symptom relief, while DI was best for maintaining remission, and FMT showed promise in reducing inflammation. Further high-quality clinical trials are needed to strengthen the evidence and guide clinical practice in IBD management.

37259751,The Potential Therapeutic Role Of Vitamin D In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is defined as a relapsing and remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation at different sites in the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) represents the two major forms of IBD. Even though IBD pathophysiology is still not fully understood, genetic factors, environmental factors, dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, alterations in gut microbiota composition, excessive consumption of saturated fats and cumulative antibiotic exposure have all been suggested to play a role in the development of this condition. Amongst the environmental factors, vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to participate in IBD pathophysiology. Indeed, vitamin D exerts several pleiotropic effects beyond its well-established regulation of bone and calcium homeostasis, including anti-infective, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects as well as maintenance of gastrointestinal barrier integrity and beneficial gut microbiota composition. In this narrative review, we discuss the role of vitamin D deficiency in IBD pathophysiology as well as the potential therapeutic use of vitamin D for the management of IBD.",Boccuzzi L; Infante M; Ricordi C,2023,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,27,10,4678-4687,10.26355/eurrev_202305_32479,"Boccuzzi, L., Infante, M., & Ricordi, C.

33960728,Increased Risk Of Stroke Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prisma-Compliant Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and stroke showed conflicting results.
METHODS: Articles published before July 2020 were searched in databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar). We computed all multivariate odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by using STATA 12.0 software.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated that IBD was associated with an elevated risk of stroke (OR/RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34, I2 = 83.6%, p < .001). In addition, both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were associated with a higher risk of stroke (CD: OR/RR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.52, I2 = 86.1%, p < .001; UC: OR/RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15, I2 = 54.7%, p = .051). Subgroup study showed that IBD was associated with a higher risk of stroke in cohort studies (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36, I2 = 85.0%, p < .001). Subgroup study showed that IBD was related to an elevated risk of stroke in both Caucasian and Asian groups (Caucasian group: OR/RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.23, I2 = 44.6%, p = .094; Asian group: OR/RR =1.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, I2 = 92.5%, p < .001).

34124132,Risk Of Urinary Bladder Cancer In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Meta-Analysis.,"A systematic search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted to investigate the risk of urinary bladder cancer (BC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We identified 168 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our analysis included 165,176 patients with IBD, 491 of whom had BC. Overall, the pooled standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87-1.12; I 2 = 0%). Further subgroup analysis showed that BC risk was neither statistically higher for Crohn's disease (CD) (SIR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.94-1.44; I 2 = 0%) nor for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (SIR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.77-1.06; I 2 = 0%). In the analysis of two case-control studies providing data on BC in UC and CD combined, IBD patients seemed to have a higher risk of BC than non-IBD patients (relative risk: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.77-2.03; I 2 = 37.5%). Although the overall risk of BC was not significantly increased among patients with IBD, there was a weak trend for the risk to be elevated in CD patients, indicating marginal significance. These findings may primarily be explained by the opposite effects of smoking on CD and UC as well as the immunosuppressive drugs these patients often take.",Geng Z; Geng Q,2021,Frontiers in surgery,8,,636791,10.3389/fsurg.2021.636791,"Geng, Z., & Geng, Q.

32282548,"Small Molecule Drugs In The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Which One, When And Why? - A Systematic Review.","In the 'treat-to-target' era of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, small molecule drugs (SMDs) represent a promising alternative to biomolecular drugs. Moreover, increasing failure rates of anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents have contributed to the development of new molecules with different mechanisms of action and bioavailability. This review focuses on the positioning of new, orally targeted therapies in the treatment algorithm of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), with special consideration to their efficacy and safety. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed and clinical trial registries to identify randomized controlled trials assessing SMDs in adult patients with moderate-to-severe IBD, irrespective of previous exposure to other biologics. In this review, we included 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of Janus kinase inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators (S1P), SMAD blockers, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors and α-4 antagonists. The primary endpoints in UC were achieved for tofacitinib in the phase III OCTAVE study and AJM-300, with a favorable safety profile. S1P receptor agonists, such as etrasimod and ozanimod, demonstrated favorable results in induction studies. For CD, filgotinib and upadacitinib also met the primary outcome criteria.

39871958,Neutrophils: From Inflammatory Bowel Disease To Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a non-specific inflammatory disease of digestive tract, primarily manifesting as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The precise etiology of IBD remains elusive. The interplay of genetic factors, environmental influences, and intestinal microbiota contributes to the establishment of an uncontrolled immune environment within the intestine, which can progressively lead to atypical hyperplasia and ultimately to malignancy over a long period. This colorectal malignant tumor that arises from chronic IBD is referred to as colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Dysregulation in the quantity and functionality of neutrophils plays a significant role in the onset, progression, and recurrence of IBD, as well as in the transition from IBD to CAC. Neutrophils affect the pathophysiology of IBD through various mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, the release of inflammatory mediators and chemokines, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These processes can induce DNA mutations, thereby facilitating the development of colon cancer. Given the incomplete understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying IBD and CAC, effective treatment and prevention strategies remain challenging. Consequently, a comprehensive review of the functional roles of neutrophils in IBD and CAC is essential for advancing our understanding of IBD pathogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.",Chen T; Liu J; Hang R; Chen Q; Wang D,2025,Journal of inflammation research,18,,925-947,10.2147/JIR.S497701,"Chen, T., Liu, J., Hang, R., Chen, Q., & Wang, D.

32758015,Endoscopy After Surgery In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Crohn'S Disease Recurrence And Pouch Surveillance.,"INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are immune-mediated disorders characterized by a chronic inflammation, with intermittent exacerbations of symptoms and inflammation. In both diseases, medical treatment has made revolutionary steps forward. Nevertheless, surgery is still required in many cases due to inefficacy of multiple medical therapies. It is not clear whether surgery rates in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are currently decreasing despite all improvements.
AREAS COVERED: Multidisciplinary management is critical in surgical patients to improve long-term outcomes. Endoscopy plays a crucial role, both before and after surgery, in planning therapeutic strategies and stratifying risk of recurrence. Aim of this review is to provide a deeper insight into the central role of endoscopy in the postoperative management of IBD patients, focusing on recent research advances, future challenges and unresolved questions.
EXPERT OPINION: Both UC and CD surgical patients need endoscopy to define the correct therapeutic choice, predict subsequent disease course and adopt the correct surveillance strategy. In the next future, newer endoscopic techniques could be systematically applied in IBD patients after surgery, to assess early postoperative inflammation, response to treatment, or, regarding UC, to provide enhanced pouch surveillance, allowing for early detection of inflammation and dysplasia.",Vespa E; Furfaro F; Allocca M; Fiorino G; Correale C; Gilardi D; Argollo M; Zilli A; Zacharopoulou E; Loy L; Danese S,2020,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,14,9,829-841,10.1080/17474124.2020.1807325,"Vespa, E., Furfaro, F., Allocca, M., Fiorino, G., Correale, C., Gilardi, D., Argollo, M., Zilli, A., Zacharopoulou, E., Loy, L., & Danese, S.

In the case of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), oral manifestations are an important clinical indicator of intestinal disease. Recent studies of the microbiome in IBD suggest that translocation of oral microbes to the gut may be a common feature of the microbial dysbiosis which is a signature of both CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). Murine studies suggest that translocation of oral bacteria and yeasts to the lower GI tract may trigger inflammation in susceptible hosts, providing a mechanistic link to the development of IBD. Conversely, some studies have shown that dysbiosis of the oral microbiome may occur, possibly as a result of inflammatory responses and could represent a useful source of biomarkers of GI health.

However, once a diagnosis of malignancy is made, the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) can be challenging as major guidelines suggest discontinuing the ongoing immunosuppressant and biological therapies for at least 2-5 years after the end of cancer treatment. Recently, new molecules such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab have been approved for IBD and limited data exist on the real risk of new or recurrent cancer in IBD patients with prior cancer, exposed to immunosuppressants and biologic agents. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach and case-by-case management is the preferred choice. The primary aim of our review was to summarize the current evidence about the safety of reintroducing an immunosuppressant or biologic agent in patients with a history of malignancy and to compare the different available therapies, including gut-selective agents. The secondary aim was to evaluate the clinical course of the IBD patients under cancer treatment who do not receive any specific immunosuppressant treatment after the diagnosis of cancer.",Ferretti F; Cannatelli R; Maconi G; Ardizzone S,2023,Cancers,15,2,,10.3390/cancers15020542,"Ferretti, F., Cannatelli, R., Maconi, G., & Ardizzone, S.

38314171,Is The Mediterranean Diet In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Ready For Prime Time?,"BACKGROUND: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), specifically in the developing world, suggests an important environmental effect. Amongst environmental influences, dietary factors, particularly the adoption of a westernized diet, have been specifically noticed. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet (MED), characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and moderate consumption of animal and ultra processed foods, has shown potential positive effects in IBD.
METHODS: Here we conducted a narrative review focusing on the evidence regarding the role of MED in IBD prevention and management.
RESULTS: Epidemiological studies suggest inverse association of MED with CD development. Furthermore, adherence to MED has been associated with clinical improvement in active CD and maintenance of lower levels of inflammatory markers in UC, along with improved quality of life and lower mortality rates in IBD patients. Mechanistically, MED promotes a diverse and beneficial gut microbiota, possesses anti-inflammatory properties through polyphenols and dietary fats, and may modulate oxidative stress. In clinical practice, MED may be adapted to diverse disease phenotypes and cultural preferences, and is a sustainable, easy to maintain dietary approach.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence may support the integration of MED into clinical practice in IBD care. In future research, the efficacy of MED in specific IBD phenotypes should be assessed.",Godny L; Dotan I,2024,Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology,7,1,97-103,10.1093/jcag/gwad041,"Godny, L., & Dotan, I.

33634430,Increased Risk Of Infections With Anti-Tnf Agents In Patients With Crohn'S Disease After Elective Surgery: Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative complication rates in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving preoperative biologics have been analyzed without considering the surgical context. Emergency surgery may be associated with an increased risk of infectious complications, compared to elective operations.
AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the relationship between preoperative biologic therapy and postoperative outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), focusing on elective surgery.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to February 12, 2020, for studies of patients with IBD undergoing elective abdominal surgery receiving biologic therapy within 3 months before surgery compared to no therapy, or another biologic therapy. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. The primary outcomes were the rate of infections and total complications within 30 days. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included. Preoperative treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in patients with CD undergoing elective surgery was associated with increased odds of infection (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.40-3.01), but not total complications (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.71-1.51). In elective surgery for UC, preoperative anti-TNF therapy was not associated with infectious (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.34-3.07) or total complications (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.29-1.58). Limited data indicate that emergency surgery did not significantly affect the rate of complications.

Due to the complex etiology of colitis, the current treatments of IBD are quite limited and are mainly concentrated on the remission of the disease. In addition, the side effects of conventional drugs on the body cannot be ignored. IBD also has a certain relationship with colitis-associated cancer (CAC), and inflammatory cells can produce a large number of tumor-promoting cytokines to promote tumor progression. In recent years, exosomes from plants have been found to have the ability to load drugs to target the intestine and have great potential for the treatment of intestinal diseases. This plant-derived exosome-targeting delivery system can load chemical or nucleic acid drugs and deliver them to intestinal inflammatory sites stably and efficiently.

32424656,Update On Therapeutic Management Of Spondyloarthritis Associated With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Management of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains a challenging task that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Separate guidelines for each disease are well-established. However, the management of SpA co-occurring with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) has hardly been studied. There are few specific reports that focus on this therapeutic area. The main issue is that some therapeutic options used to treat one disease can negatively influence the other disease course. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic alternatives that would allow for the appropriate management of patients with both SpA and IBD. Key Points • Collaboration between gastroenterologists and rheumatologists is recommended to improve the management of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). • When treating SpA occurring simultaneously with IBD, it would be appropriate to give priority to the active disease. • Considering its well-proven efficacy in both conditions, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy remains the corner stone in the treatment of these patients. • Other therapeutic options such as Janus kinases (JAK) inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-12 inhibitors, and vedolizumab are still under investigation.",Ben Nessib D; Ferjani H; Maatallah K; Rahmouni S; Kaffel D; Hamdi W,2020,Clinical rheumatology,39,12,3543-3553,10.1007/s10067-020-05136-x,"Ben Nessib, D., Ferjani, H., Maatallah, K., Rahmouni, S., Kaffel, D., & Hamdi, W.

39274415,Imaging Of Ulcerative Colitis: The Role Of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a promising and appealing alternative to endoscopy in the objective assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a specialized imaging technique that enables the mapping of water molecule diffusion within biological tissues, eliminating the need for intravenous gadolinium contrast injection. It is expanding the capability of traditional MRI sequences in Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Recently, there has been growing interest in the application of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging in the field of IBD. This technique combines diffusion and perfusion information, making it a valuable tool for assessing IBD treatment response. Previous studies have extensively studied the use of DWI techniques for evaluating the severity of activity in IBD. However, the majority of these studies have primarily focused on Crohn's disease (CD), with only a limited number of reports specifically examining UC. Therefore, this review briefly introduces the basics of DWI and IVIM imaging and conducts a review of relevant studies that have investigated its application in UC to show whether these techniques are useful techniques for evaluating patients with UC in terms of detection, characterization, and quantification of disease activity. Through the extensive literature survey, most of these studies indicate that DWI proves valuable in the differential diagnosis of UC and could be used as an effective modality for staging UC.",Alyami AS,2024,Journal of clinical medicine,13,17,,10.3390/jcm13175204,"Alyami, A.

36145514,"Under The Umbrella Of Clinical Pharmacology: Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Infliximab And Adalimumab, And A Bridge To An Era Of Biosimilars.","Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have revolutionized the treatment of many chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a term that comprises two quite similar, yet distinctive, disorders-Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Two blockbuster MAbs, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL), transformed the pharmacological approach of treating CD and UC. However, due to the complex interplay of pharmacology and immunology, MAbs face challenges related to their immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety. To ease the burden of IBD and other severe diseases, biosimilars have emerged as a cost-effective alternative to an originator product. According to the current knowledge, biosimilars of IFX and ADL in IBD patients are shown to be as safe and effective as their originators. The future of biosimilars, in general, is promising due to the potential of making the health care system more sustainable. However, their use is accompanied by misconceptions regarding their effectiveness and safety, as well as by controversy regarding their interchangeability. Hence, until a scientific consensus is achieved, scientific data on the long-term effectiveness and safety of biosimilars are needed.",Petric Z; Goncalves J; Paixao P,2022,Pharmaceutics,14,9,,10.3390/pharmaceutics14091766,"Petric, Z., Goncalves, J., & Paixao, P.

39339221,Advancements In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Management: From Traditional Treatments To Monoclonal Antibodies And Future Drug Delivery Systems.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with two main subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The pathogenesis involves genetic predisposition, dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation. Complications include perianal lesions, strictures, fistulas, perforations, and an increased risk of colon cancer. Clinical classification ranges from mild to fulminant and recurrent disease, with common symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and weight loss. Extraintestinal manifestations include arthritis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and uveitis. Conventional treatments using aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators have limitations. Biologics, introduced in the 1990s, offer improved efficacy and specificity, targeting factors like TNF-α, integrins, and cytokines. Monoclonal antibodies play a crucial role in IBD management, aiming to reduce relapses, hospitalizations, and surgeries. In conclusion, this review is aimed at summarizing the latest knowledge, advantages, and drawbacks of IBD therapies, such as small molecules, biologics, and monoclonal antibodies, to provide a basis for further research in the IBD field.",Di Rienzo A; Marinelli L; Dimmito MP; Toto EC; Di Stefano A; Cacciatore I,2024,Pharmaceutics,16,9,,10.3390/pharmaceutics16091185,"Di Rienzo, A., Marinelli, L., Dimmito, M.

34449288,Anti-Integrin Drugs In Clinical Trials For Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd): Insights Into Promising Agents.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite huge and increasing developments in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a significant percentage of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is still in need of an effective and safe therapeutic option. Tackling the trafficking of leukocytes specifically within or directed to the inflamed gut appears to be a particularly promising strategy, and several new anti-integrin agents are currently under investigation in clinical trials.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes efficacy and safety data from phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials on investigational drugs, including monoclonal antibodies (etrolizumab, abrilumab, ontamalimab) and oral small molecules (AJM300, PTG-100). It also discusses the future perspectives for the treatment of IBD patients with this class of agents.
EXPERT OPINION: The pipeline of anti-integrin agents is well assorted, and it is reasonable to expect that some will be introduced in the market soon. Among the most exciting features of this class are the gut selectivity, the convenient subcutaneous and oral administrations and the reassuring safety profiles. Most of the new anti-integrins seem to improve outcomes in UC but not in CD, however these data are far from definitive and several pivotal trials are still under way.",Solitano V; Parigi TL; Ragaini E; Danese S,2021,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,30,10,1037-1046,10.1080/13543784.2021.1974396,"Solitano, V., Parigi, T.

39867090,Infliximab Precision Dosing In Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) Patients: A Review Of Current Literature.,"The therapeutic failure of infliximab therapy remains a challenge in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and dose optimization is often required. Accelerated or intensified regimes showed value in treating patients in the acute setting with high CRP or low albumin levels, which are suggested by recent guidelines; however, evidence is weak. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) trough levels and antibodies, showed value during maintenance therapy, but not in induction and can guide clinical decisions in patients that might be undertreated with the standard dosing regimen. Combining the impact of therapeutic drug monitoring with a Bayesian forecasting methodology to calculate drug clearance can help on calculating the optimal infliximab dose for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) on both the induction and maintenance phase. This will help to identify those who need intensification of their current regime to boost the therapeutic effect and those who are non-responders.

34899362,Intestinal Macrophage Autophagy And Its Pharmacological Application In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders. IBD is regarded as a severe healthcare problem worldwide, with high morbidity and lethality. So far, despite of numerous studies on this issue, the specific mechanisms of IBD still remain unclarified and ideal treatments are not available for IBD. The intestinal mucosal barrier is vital for maintaining the function of the intestinal self-defensive system. Among all of the components, macrophage is an important one in the intestinal self-defensive system, normally protecting the gut against exotic invasion. However, the over-activation of macrophages in pathological conditions leads to the overwhelming induction of intestinal inflammatory and immune reaction, thus damaging the intestinal functions. Autophagy is an important catabolic mechanism. It has been proven to participate the regulation of various kinds of inflammation- and immune-related disorders via the regulation of inflammation in related cells. Here in this paper, we will review the role and mechanism of intestinal macrophage autophagy in IBD. In addition, several well-studied kinds of agents taking advantage of intestinal macrophage autophagy for the treatment of IBD will also be discussed. We aim to bring novel insights in the development of therapeutic strategies against IBD.",Zheng Y; Yu Y; Chen XF; Yang SL; Tang XL; Xiang ZG,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,803686,10.3389/fphar.2021.803686,"Zheng, Y., Yu, Y., Chen, X.

40603749,An Updated Meta-Analysis Of Pancreatic Cancer Risk In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the risk of developing pancreatic cancer (PC).
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHOD: We searched PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, and Scopus up until September 8, 2024. To evaluate heterogeneity among the studies, we used the chi-square test and the I2 statistic. An I2 value exceeding 50% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity. We calculated estimates of odds ratios (OR), relative risks (RR), and hazard ratios (HR), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The analysis was performed using a random-effects model. We established a significance level of less than 0.05 using Stata software, version 17.
RESULTS: We included a total of 17 studies in our analysis. Overall, patients with IBD showed a higher risk of developing PC, with an OR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.48-1.93). Specifically, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) had an OR of 1.25 (95% CI: 1.10-1.41), while those with ulcerative colitis (UC) had an OR = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.10-1.45). Furthermore, patients with IBD accompanied by primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) displayed a significantly higher risk, with an OR = 3.12 (95% CI: 1.67-5.85). Additionally, there was no evidence of publication bias across all subgroups. Although there was no publication bias, we conducted a trim-and-fill analysis to investigate the small study effect. This analysis revealed that the results were influenced by omitted studies and that the pooled effects would be diluted if the omitted studies were included in the meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: CD and UC are associated with an increased risk of PC, with no significant difference in risk levels between the two conditions. However, having IIBD along with PSC increases the risk of PC threefold.",Salehi AM; Chegini SB; Danaei S; Hasanzarrini M; Shahbazi F,2025,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,56,1,147,10.1007/s12029-025-01266-0,"Salehi, A.

40217934,The Role Of Histology Alongside Clinical And Endoscopic Evaluation In The Management Of Ibd-A Narrative Review.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions requiring continuous monitoring. Today, endoscopy is the gold standard for assessing disease activity, with histological evaluation providing additional insights. Studies suggest that persistent histological inflammation, despite endoscopic remission, may be associated with a higher risk of relapse in UC, suggesting its role in treatment decisions. In CD, histological assessment is limited by its patchy nature, transmural inflammation and lack of validated scoring systems. Few retrospective studies with conflicting results have examined the prognostic value of histological remission in CD, and its role in predicting long-term outcomes remains unclear. This narrative review aims to summarize and discuss the available evidence regarding the additional value of histological assessment in IBD management. In UC, the ongoing VERDICT study is expected to provide evidence on the impact of incorporating histological remission as a treatment target compared to a strategy based on clinical and endoscopic activity. Recently published interim results indicate that targeting histological remission does not lead to better clinical/biochemical disease activity. Thus, while patients achieving histological healing are associated with better outcomes, the question arises whether achieving histological remission is an intrinsic (biological) characteristic of the patient and indicator of an easier to treat patient group or a result of more effective therapy.",Angyal D; Balogh F; Bessissow T; Wetwittayakhlang P; Ilias A; Gonczi L; Lakatos PL,2025,Journal of clinical medicine,14,7,,10.3390/jcm14072485,"Angyal, D., Balogh, F., Bessissow, T., Wetwittayakhlang, P., Ilias, A., Gonczi, L., & Lakatos, P.

32799561,Evolution Of Infliximab Biosimilar In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: From Intravenous To Subcutaneous Ct-P13.,"INTRODUCTION: Biologic drugs have significantly improved the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). After its patent expired other manufactures developed biosimilar versions, among which CT-P13, and licensed them thorough an expedite process.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13.
EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health-care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.",Parigi TL; D'Amico F; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S,2021,Expert opinion on biological therapy,21,1,37-46,10.1080/14712598.2020.1811849,"Parigi, T.

39498116,Advancements In The Use Of Ai In The Diagnosis And Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes chronic inflammation of the colon and digestive tract, and it can be classified as Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD is more prevalent in Europe and North America, however, since the beginning of the 21st century it has been increasing in South America, Asia, and Africa, leading to its consideration as a worldwide problem. Optical colonoscopy is one of the crucial tests in diagnosing and assessing the progression and prognosis of IBD, as it allows a real-time optical visualization of the colonic wall and ileum and allows for the collection of tissue samples. The accuracy of colonoscopy procedures depends on the expertise and ability of the endoscopists. Therefore, algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for colonoscopy images and videos are growing in popularity, especially for the detection and classification of colorectal polyps. The performance of this system is dependent on the quality and quantity of the data used for training. There are several datasets publicly available for endoscopy images and videos, but most of them are solely specialized in polyps. The use of DL algorithms to detect IBD is still in its inception, most studies are based on assessing the severity of UC. As artificial intelligence (AI) grows in popularity there is a growing interest in the use of these algorithms for diagnosing and classifying the IBDs and managing their progression. To tackle this, more annotated colonoscopy images and videos will be required for the training of new and more reliable AI algorithms.

37817217,Causal Association Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease And 32 Site-Specific Extracolonic Cancers: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of extracolonic cancer is increased in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, but it is not clear whether there is a causal relationship. We aimed to systematically estimate the causal relationship between IBD and extracolonic cancers.
METHODS: Independent genetic variants strongly associated with IBD were extracted as instrumental variables from genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the International IBD Genetics Consortium including 12,882 IBD patients, 5956 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 6968 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Three sources of cancer GWAS were selected as outcome data. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the causal effects of IBD on 32 extracolonic cancers. The meta-analysis was applied to assess the combined causal effect with multiple MR results.
RESULTS: IBD, CD, and UC have potential causal associations with oral cavity cancer (IBD: OR = 1.180, 95% CI: 1.059 to 1.316, P = 0.003; CD: OR = 1.112, 95% CI: 1.008 to 1.227, P = 0.034; UC: OR = 1.158, 95% CI: 1.041 to 1.288, P = 0.007). Meta-analysis showed a significant positive causal relationship between IBD and breast cancer (OR = 1.059; 95% CI: 1.033 to 1.086; P < 0.0001) as well as a potential causal relationship between CD and breast cancer (OR = 1.029; 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.055; P = 0.032) based on combining multiple MR results.

39921836,Insights Into Adverse Events And Safety Profile Of Upadacitinib In The Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - A Meta-Analysis Of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with upadacitinib and examined secondary adverse events.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing upadacitinib with placebo in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The primary outcome was the incidence of SAEs, while secondary outcomes included specific adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: Six RCTs, including 2611 patients, were analyzed. The incidence of SAEs did not significantly differ between upadacitinib (6.1%) and placebo (7%) (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.50-1.20; p = 0.25). Secondary outcomes showed no significant differences in serious infections, hepatic disorders, nasopharyngitis or herpes zoster. However, neutropenia (RR = 5.63; 95% CI: 1.90-16.65; p = 0.0002) and creatine kinase elevation (RR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.22-4.47; p = 0.01) were higher with upadacitinib, while anemia (RR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.27-0.48; p < 0.00001) and arthralgia (RR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.30-0.75; p = 0.001) were reduced.
CONCLUSION: Upadacitinib did not increase the overall risk of SAEs in IBD patients, with a notable reduction in anemia and arthralgia. However, the higher risks of neutropenia and CK elevation underscore the importance of monitoring.

36239805,Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Risk Of Coronary Heart Disease : A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD); however, the causal link between IBD and CHD is unclear. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the association between genetically predicted IBD and CHD risk.
METHODS: Exposure summary data were obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with cohorts of IBD (12,882 cases and 21,770 controls), UC (6968 cases and 20,464 controls), and CD (5956 cases and 14,927 controls) of European descent to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables. Outcome summary data were obtained from a meta-analysis of 22 GWAS including 22,233 cases and 64,762 controls of European descent. To estimate MR, four methods were used, including inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted median methods. Sensitivity analysis was also performed. The Bonferroni method was used to correct the bias of multiple testing.
RESULTS: Three sets of SNPs (69 SNPs of IBD, 40 SNPs of UC, and 58 SNPs of CD) were used to estimate the causal effect between genetically predicted IBD and CHD. Using the IVW method, we found that no causal relationship between genetically predicted IBD and CHD after Bonferroni correction, and there was no causal relationship between UC/CD and the development of CHD. No evidence of significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy was found.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that genetically predicted IBD may have no causal effect on CHD risk in a population with European ancestry.",Qiu X; Hou C; Yang Z; Wang Q; Li L,2022,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,134,21-22,779-787,10.1007/s00508-022-02095-y,"Qiu, X., Hou, C., Yang, Z., Wang, Q., & Li, L.

37519622,"Advancements In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Narrative Review Of Diagnostics, Management, Epidemiology, Prevalence, Patient Outcomes, Quality Of Life, And Clinical Presentation.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder that impacts the gastrointestinal tract. Significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD have been made during the past few decades, improving patient outcomes. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD. Both from an evaluative and therapeutic standpoint, the management of IBD has undergone significant change. The standard of treatment for treating UC and CD patients has changed due to several medical developments. These developments include amino-salicylates, immunosuppressants, biological agents, and new therapeutics. The review also addresses the difficulties in applying these developments in clinical practice. Globally, the prevalence of IBD is rising, with Asia among the regions with the highest rates. These environments provide particular difficulties, such as poor disease knowledge, a lack of diagnostic services, and infectious IBD mimics. These issues must be resolved to diagnose and manage IBD in these populations accurately. New imaging modalities and other improvements in diagnostic methods have increased the precision and early identification of IBD. To reduce problems and improve patient outcomes, healthcare professionals treating patients with IBD must work effectively as a team. An extensive summary of current developments in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD is given in this narrative review. It draws attention to the therapeutic possibilities, difficulties, and uncertainties of integrating these developments into clinical practice. By keeping up with these changes, healthcare practitioners can better care for patients with IBD and improve their quality of life.",Muzammil MA; Fariha F; Patel T; Sohail R; Kumar M; Khan E; Khanam B; Kumar S; Khatri M; Varrassi G; Vanga P,2023,Cureus,15,6,e41120,10.7759/cureus.41120,"Muzammil, M.

40650240,Nanomedicine Strategies In The Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Colorectal Cancer.,"The gut microbiota has emerged as a key area of biomedical research due to its integral role in maintaining host health and its involvement in the pathogenesis of many systemic diseases. Growing evidence supports the notion that gut dysbiosis contributes significantly to diseases and their progression. An example would be inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group of conditions that cause inflammation and swelling of the digestive tract, with the principal types being ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Another notable disease with significant association to gut dysbiosis would be colorectal cancer (CRC), a malignancy which typically begins as polyps in the colon or rectum, but has the potential to metastasise to other parts of the body, including the liver and lungs, among others. Concurrently, advances in nanomedicine, an evolving field that applies nanotechnology for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, have opened new avenues for targeted and efficient therapeutic strategies. In this paper, we provide an overview of the gut microbiota and the implications of its dysregulation in human disease. We then review the emerging nanotechnology-based approaches for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, with a particular focus on their applications in IBD and CRC.",Tan AXX; Ong BYC; Dinesh T; Srinivasan DK,2025,International journal of molecular sciences,26,13,,10.3390/ijms26136465,"Tan, A.

38106709,Therapeutic Granulomonocytapheresis As A Non-Pharmacologic Treatment Option For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Efficacy Reports On A Wide Age Range And Disease Profile.,"The major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which cause debilitating symptoms, including bloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and fever. Patients require life-long immunosuppressive medications, which cause adverse side effects as additional morbidity factors. However, IBD is initiated and perpetuated by inflammatory cytokines, and given that in patients with IBD myeloid lineage leukocytes are elevated with activation behavior and release inflammatory cytokines, selective depletion of elevated granulocytes and monocytes by granulomonocytapheresis is a relevant therapeutic option for IBD patients. Therefore, a column filled with specially designed beads as granulomonocytapheresis carriers for selective adsorption of myeloid lineage leukocytes (Adacolumn) has been applied to treat patients with active IBD. Patients receive up to 10 granulomonocytapheresis sessions at one or two sessions per week. During each session, the carriers adsorb up to 60% of the myeloid leukocytes from the blood that passes through the granulomonocytapheresis column. Efficacy rates in the UC setting have been as high as 85% in steroid-naïve patients, and 100% in drug-naïve, first-episode cases, but patients with a long duration of active IBD and extensive colonic lesions that have become refractory to pharmacological treatment have not responded well. However, granulomonocytapheresis has a favorable safety profile. Given that immunosuppressive medications used to treat IBD potentially may increase the risk of severe viral infection, non-drug granulomonocytapheresis should be a favorable treatment strategy. Further, by targeting granulomonocytapheresis to patients with background features and identifying a patient as a likely responder, futile use of medical resources is avoided.",Tanaka T,2023,Cureus,15,11,e48913,10.7759/cureus.48913,"Tanaka, T.

36219564,Most Placebo-Controlled Trials In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Were Underpowered Because Of Overestimated Drug Efficacy Rates: Results From A Systematic Review Of Induction Studies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most pharmaceutical clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are placebo-controlled and require effect size estimation for a drug relative to placebo. We compared expected effect sizes in sample size calculations [SSCs] to actual effect sizes in IBD clinical trials.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane library were searched from inception to March 26, 2021, to identify placebo-controlled induction studies for luminal Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] that reported an SSC and a primary endpoint of clinical remission/response. Expected effects were subtracted from actual effects, and interquartile ranges [IQRs] for each corresponding median difference were calculated. Linear regression was used to assess whether placebo or drug event rate misspecifications were responsible for these differences.
RESULTS: Of eligible studies, 36.9% [55/149] were excluded because of incomplete SSC reporting, yielding 94 studies [46 CD, 48 UC]. Treatment effects were overestimated in CD for remission (-12.6% [IQR: -16.3 to -1.6%]), in UC for remission (-10.2% [IQR: -16.5 to -5.6%]) and in CD for response (-15.3% [IQR: -27.1 to -5.8%]). Differences observed were due to overestimated drug event rates, whereas expected and actual placebo event rates were similar. A meta-regression demonstrated associations between overestimated treatment effect sizes and several trial characteristics: isolated ileal disease, longer CD duration, extensive colitis [UC], single-centre, phase 2 and no endoscopic endpoint component [UC].
CONCLUSION: Overestimation of IBD therapy efficacy rates resulted in smaller-than-expected treatment effects. These results should be used to inform SSCs and trial design for IBD drug development.",Bahnam P; Hanzel J; Ma C; Zou L; Narula N; Singh S; Kahan B; Jairath V,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,3,404-417,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac150,"Bahnam, P., Hanzel, J., Ma, C., Zou, L., Narula, N., Singh, S., Kahan, B., & Jairath, V.

38716206,"Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Clinical Presentation, Management, And Outcomes Of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Narrative Review.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition that has been increasing in prevalence and incidence worldwide. Although, most cases are described in Caucasian populations, there has been a rise in IBD diagnosis among other populations. In this article, we will discuss the disparities in the presentation, management, medical and surgical outcomes of IBD patients among different racial and ethnic groups.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. The search strategy included targeted keywords to identify specific studies that provided the current literature on disparities in IBD presentation and management. Articles for presentation were selected by the authors, in accordance with a narrative review format, favoring population-based studies, systematic reviews and meta-analysis over single or multicenter reports.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Epidemiological data has shown that there is an increasing incidence in IBD diagnosis among Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations over the past decade. Differences in genetic predispositions have been observed, however it is difficult to ascertain if the minor differences in presentation and medical/surgical management reported are due to innate differences or due to confounding factors such as access to health care.

METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science for observational studies published before June 2020, and the quality of each included study was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies comprising 531 449 IBD patients and more than 65 million reference individuals were included. Although IBD was significantly associated with 67% increased risk of the total gastric, small bowel and colorectal cancer. After stratifying by cancer location, IBD mainly increased the risk of intestinal cancer instead of gastric cancer. Furthermore, Crohn's disease (CD) significantly increased the risk of both small bowel cancer and colorectal cancer, while ulcerative colitis (UC) only increased the risk of colorectal cancer. In subgroup analysis, associations between IBD and risk of total gastric, small bowel and colorectal cancer were similar between male and female, except for that male IBD patients but not female had a significantly higher risk of small bowel cancer. Additionally, IBD patients in different geographical areas had different associations with risk of various gastrointestinal tract cancers.

39064745,The Effect Of Protein Nutritional Support On Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Its Potential Mechanisms.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a complex chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that includes Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), has become a globally increasing health concern. Nutrition, as an important factor influencing the occurrence and development of IBD, has attracted more and more attention. As the most important nutrient, protein can not only provide energy and nutrition required by patients, but also help repair damaged intestinal tissue, enhance immunity, and thus alleviate inflammation. Numerous studies have shown that protein nutritional support plays a significant role in the treatment and remission of IBD. This article presents a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of IBD and analyzes and summarizes the potential mechanisms of protein nutritional support in IBD. Additionally, it provides an overview of the clinical effects of protein nutritional support in IBD and its impact on clinical complications. Research findings reveal that protein nutritional support demonstrates significant benefits in improving clinical symptoms, reducing the risk of complications, and improving quality of life in IBD patients. Therefore, protein nutritional support is expected to provide a new approach for the treatment of IBD.",Li Q; Wang J,2024,Nutrients,16,14,,10.3390/nu16142302,"Li, Q., & Wang, J. (2024).

37859409,Application Of Drug Repurposing Approach For Therapeutic Intervention Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) characterized by chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation, abdominal pain, cramping, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhoea, and weight loss. Although the etiology of IBD remains unclear, it is believed to be an interaction between genes, and environmental factors, such as an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, changing food habits, an ultra-hygiene environment, and an inappropriate immune system. The development of novel effective therapies is stymied by a lack of understanding of the aetiology of IBD. The current therapy involves the use of aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids that can effectively manage symptoms, induce and sustain remission, prevent complications, modify the course of the disease, provide diverse treatment options, showcase advancements in biologic therapies, and enhance the overall quality of life. However, the efficacy of current therapy is overshadowed by a plethora of adverse effects, such as loss of weight, mood swings, skin issues, loss of bone density, higher vulnerability to infections, and elevated blood pressure. Biologicals, like anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, can stimulate an autoimmune response in certain individuals that may diminish the effectiveness of the medication over time, necessitating a switch to alternative treatments. The response of IBD patients to current drug therapy is quite varied, which can lead to disease flares that underlines the urgent need to explore alternative treatment option to address the unmet need of developing new treatment strategies for IBD with high efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Drug repurposing is a novel strategy where existing drugs that have already been validated safe in patients for the management of certain diseases are redeployed to treat other, unindicated diseases. The present narrative review focuses on potential drug candidates that could be repurposed for the management of IBD using on-target and off-target strategies. It covers their preclinical, clinical assessment, mechanism of action, and safety profiles, and forecasts their appropriateness in the management of IBD. The review presents useful insights into the most promising candidates for repurposing, like anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic troxerutin, which has been found to improve the DSS-induced colitis in rats, an antiosteoarthritic drug diacetylrhein that has been found to have remarkable ameliorating effects on DSS-induced colitis via anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory properties and by influencing both apoptosis and pyroptosis.

35677820,The Impact Of Intestinal Ultrasound On The Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: From Established Facts Toward New Horizons.,"Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) plays a crucial role as a non-invasive and accurate tool to diagnose and assess inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The rationale for using IUS in Crohn's disease (CD), a transmural disease, is widely acknowledged. While the use of IUS in ulcerative colitis (UC), a mucosal disease, is often underestimated, but, recently, it is increasingly expanding. In the context of a treat-to-target approach, the role of IUS is shifting toward a monitoring tool for predicting response to therapy. Hence, adjusting therapeutic strategies based on IUS response could reduce the burden related to endoscopy and speed the decision process with the ultimate goal to alter the natural course of IBD. Assessment of bowel wall thickness (BWT) is the most reliable IUS measure. However, the development of validated and reproducible sonographic scores to measure disease activity and the identification of parameters of therapeutic response remain relevant issues to implement the daily adoption of IUS in clinical practice. Accordingly, this review focuses on the current literature investigating the impact of IUS on CD with emphasis on the concept of transmural healing (TH) and the main related advantages.

33233007,Increased Risk Of Ischemic Heart Disease And Diabetes In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed inconsistent results regarding associations between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes. The present study aimed to make a meta-analysis to assess the risk of IHD and diabetes in IBD.
METHODS: We searched for articles published before February 2020 in the databases as follows: PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. We computed odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) regarding the association between IBD and risk of IHD or diabetes by using STATA 13.0 software.
RESULTS: The present meta-analysis showed that IBD was associated with higher risk of IHD (OR/RR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.20 to 1.32, I2 = 88.3 %, p < 0.0001). Additionally, both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were associated with higher risk of IHD (UC: OR/RR = 1.19, 95 % CI 1.13 to 1.26, I2 = 65.6 %, p = 0.001; CD: OR/RR = 1.33, 95 % CI 1.17 to 1.51, I2 = 89.5 %, p < 0.0001). The study showed that IBD was associated with elevated risk of diabetes (OR/RR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.53, I2 = 92.1 %, I2 = 92.1 %, p < 0.0001). Additionally, both UC and CD were associated with higher risk of diabetes (UC: OR/RR = 1.33, 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.71, I2 = 93.8 %, p < 0.0001; CD: OR/RR = 1.39, 95 % CI 1.10 to 1.76, I2 = 76.7 %, p = 0.002).

33216452,An Insight Into The Roles Of Dietary Tryptophan And Its Metabolites In Intestinal Inflammation And Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex, chronic, and relapsing gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, which includes mainly two conditions, namely ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Development of IBD in any individual is closely related to his/her autoimmune regulation, gene-microbiota interactions, and dietary factors. Dietary tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid for intestinal mucosal cells, and it is associated with the intestinal inflammation, epithelial barrier, and energy homeostasis of the host. According to recent studies, Trp and its three major metabolic pathways, namely kynurenine (KYN) pathway, indole pathway, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) pathway, have vital roles in the regulation of intestinal inflammation by acting directly or indirectly on the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines, functions of various immune cells, as well as the intestinal microbial composition and homeostasis. In this review, recent advances in Trp- and its metabolites-associated intestinal inflammation are summarized. It further discusses the complex mechanisms and interrelationships of the three major metabolic pathways of Trp in regulating inflammation, which could elucidate the value of dietary Trp to be used as a nutrient for IBD patients.",Li X; Zhang ZH; Zabed HM; Yun J; Zhang G; Qi X,2021,Molecular nutrition & food research,65,5,e2000461,10.1002/mnfr.202000461,"Li, X., Zhang, Z.

39195452,Marine Algae And Deriving Biomolecules For The Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Potential Clinical Therapeutics To Decrease Gut Inflammatory And Oxidative Stress Markers?,"The term ""inflammatory bowel disease"" (IBD) describes a class of relapse-remitting conditions that affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Among these, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two of the most globally prevalent and debilitating conditions. Several articles have brought attention to the significant role that inflammation and oxidative stress cooperatively play in the development of IBD, offering a different viewpoint both on its etiopathogenesis and on strategies for the effective treatment of these conditions. Marine ecosystems may be a significant source of physiologically active substances, supporting the search for new potential clinical therapeutics. Based on this evidence, this review aims to comprehensively evaluate the activity of marine algae and deriving biomolecules in decreasing pathological features of CD and UC. To match this purpose, a deep search of the literature on PubMed (MEDLINE) and Google Scholar was performed to highlight primary biological mechanisms, the modulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress biochemical parameters, and potential clinical benefits deriving from marine species. From our findings, both macroalgae and microalgae have shown potential as therapeutic solutions for IBD due to their bioactive compounds and their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities which are capable of modulating markers such as cytokines, the NF-κB pathway, reactive oxidative and nitrosative species (ROS and RNS), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), lactoferrin, SIRT1, etc. However, while we found promising preclinical evidence, more extensive and long-term clinical studies are necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of marine algae for IBD treatment.",Repici A; Hasan A; Capra AP; Scuderi SA; Paterniti I; Campolo M; Ardizzone A; Esposito E,2024,Marine drugs,22,8,,10.3390/md22080336,"Repici, A., Hasan, A., Capra, A.

37629560,The Role Of Plant-Derived Natural Products In The Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-What Is The Clinical Evidence So Far?,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are a major healthcare challenge worldwide. Disturbances in the immune system and gut microbiota followed by environmental triggers are thought to be part of the aetiological factors. Current treatment for IBD includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and other biologic agents; however, some patients are still unresponsive, and these are also linked to high financial load and severe side effects. Plant-derived natural products are rich in phytochemicals and have been used as healing agents in several diseases since antiquity due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, as well as gut microbiota modulation. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that phytochemicals act in key pathways that are associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. It is also reported that the use of plant-derived natural products as complementary treatments is increasing amongst patients with IBD to avoid the side effects accompanying standard medical treatment.

32560118,Oral Manifestations Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease And The Role Of Non-Invasive Surrogate Markers Of Disease Activity.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can be associated with several extra-intestinal manifestations requiring a multidisciplinary management both in terms of work-up and therapy. Oral lesions are common in patients with IBD, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 50%. These can represent an oral location of IBD as well as a side-effect of drugs used to treat the intestinal disease. Oral manifestations, occurring in patients with IBD, can be divided in nonmalignant, specific, and non-specific ones, and malignant lesions. While there is undoubtedly a need to search for an IBD in patients with oral lesions associated with intestinal symptoms, the work-up of those with an exclusive oral lesion should be personalized. Fecal calprotectin is a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation and may be used to select which patients need to undergo endoscopic examination, thereby avoiding unnecessary investigations. The pharmacological armamentarium to treat oral lesions associated with IBD includes topical or systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic drugs.",Ribaldone DG; Brigo S; Mangia M; Saracco GM; Astegiano M; Pellicano R,2020,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",7,6,,10.3390/medicines7060033,"Ribaldone, D.

38716215,From Random To Precise: Updated Colon Cancer Screening And Surveillance For Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). The pathogenesis of CRC in IBD differs from sporadic cancer, with the burden of inflammation being an important contributing factor. Other risk factors for developing CRC in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) includes a family history of CRC, personal history of dysplasia, history of strictures, or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Dysplasia is the precursor of cancer and ensuring effective surveillance strategies is vital for early detection and intervention. In the past, dysplasia detection relied on random biopsies, but recent studies have shown that, with the adaptation of high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE), dye sprayed chromoendoscopy (DCE) and virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE), dysplasia detection has improved. While there exists a certain degree of consensus amongst experts regarding the management of dysplasia, it is important to implement a personalized approach to each patient's care. Our review focuses on advancements in the past two decades, specifically highlighting the modifications that have been implemented since the SCENIC guidelines. It also explores future directions, including the potential implementation of stool studies as a non-invasive tool for surveillance and the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) in dysplasia detection.",Fatakhova K; Rajapakse R,2024,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,9,,27,10.21037/tgh-23-36,"Fatakhova, K., & Rajapakse, R.

40187540,Small Molecule Drug Absorption In Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Current Implementation In Physiologically- Based Pharmacokinetic Models.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, with predominant localization in the colon in ulcerative colitis (UC) or affecting the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract in Crohn's disease (CD). Recent advances in the drug development space have been marked by a return to orally administered small molecules with novel mechanisms of action such as Janus kinase inhibitors. Additionally, the prevalence of certain chronic conditions is higher in IBD patients, many of which are treated with orally administered drugs. Given the pathophysiology and localization of IBD, altered drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract can be expected. This review discusses several physiological differences between the small and large intestine with the potential to influence drug absorption including pathophysiology related alterations associated with IBD. The main physiological parameters which are identified include luminal fluid volume, luminal pH, transit time, bile salt concentration, microbiome, absorptive surface area, permeability and metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Literature regarding these factors in IBD patients is marked with high heterogeneity in reporting of disease severity and location leading to difficulties in interpreting data across different studies. While the influence of most of these factors has been directly assessed in healthy volunteers, this is rarely the case for IBD patients. Furthermore, studies which used PBPK modelling to describe the PK of an orally administered drug in an IBD population and were able to verify their findings using clinical data are critically examined. These models were able to incorporate the pathophysiological changes associated with IBD and partly succeeded in adequately predicting drug absorption in this population. Given the limited amount of PBPK studies performed on a limited number of drugs, the developed models are most likely not suitable to be used as a general PBPK model for the IBD population.",Langeraert J; Gasthuys E; Vermeulen A,2025,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,209,,107095,10.1016/j.ejps.2025.107095,"Langeraert, J., Gasthuys, E., & Vermeulen, A.

39451734,The Impact Of Gastrectomy On Inflammatory Bowel Disease Risk In Gastric Cancer Patients: A Critical Analysis.,"Gastrectomy, a prevalent surgical procedure for gastric cancer, results in substantial alterations to the gastrointestinal tract, including reduced gastric acid production and significant modifications to the gut microbiota. These changes can impair postoperative recovery, influence metabolic functions, and predispose patients to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies have shown an increased risk of IBD, particularly Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), in patients following gastrectomy and bariatric surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). For instance, patients undergoing RYGB have a higher hazard ratio for developing CD, while SG patients show an increased risk for UC. The surgical alteration of the gastrointestinal tract promotes dysbiosis, with a significant increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial microbial populations. This dysbiosis can impair the intestinal mucosal barrier and promote systemic inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms behind these changes and their clinical implications is essential for developing effective postoperative management strategies. Probiotics and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have shown promise in mitigating these adverse effects, improving gut microbiota balance, and enhancing patient outcomes. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the long-term impacts of gastrectomy on gastrointestinal health and to refine therapeutic approaches for postoperative care.",Christodoulidis G; Koumarelas KE; Tsagkidou K; Agko ES; Bartzi D; Koumarelas K; Zacharoulis D,2024,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",31,10,5789-5801,10.3390/curroncol31100430,"Christodoulidis, G., Koumarelas, K.

37601738,Restorative Pouch Surgery Following Proctocolectomy For Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Past Experience And Future Direction.,"Major advancements in surgery for patients suffering proctocolitis from ulcerative colitis (UC) or selected patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have emerged in a relatively short time. Historically, patients underwent a proctocolectomy with end ileostomy, however, a restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) was introduced in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom and gave patients the opportunity to avoid a permanent stoma. Initially designed as a hand-sewn ""S"" shaped pouch, with the invention of the linear stapler, a ""J"" shaped pouch was described in Japan, and subsequent advances in the United States largely contributed to the pelvic pouch's evolution to the standard of care in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The procedure was then divided into different stages depending on the medical condition of the patient and minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic & robotic surgery) have continued to advance the success of the operation. Unfortunately, pouch complications occur, and seem to be occurring at an increasing frequency with the adoption of minimally invasive surgery. The field of reoperative pouch surgery has emerged to offer patients the opportunity to restore their quality of life (QOL) without the need for a permanent ostomy. Many patients with signs of pouch failure such as pouchitis, fistulae, pain and obstruction are diagnosed with Crohn's of the pouch, but many have mechanical complications that can be corrected with surgery, rather than offering pouch excision with a permanent ostomy (continent or traditional). Patients with Crohn's may be offered an IPAA but they will not have success if they, like patients with UC, have mechanical complications leading to their pouch failure. Patients who undergo reoperative pouch surgery do well with an acceptable QOL.",Cohen D; Silvestri C; Schwartzberg DM,2023,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,8,,27,10.21037/tgh-23-28,"Cohen, D., Silvestri, C., & Schwartzberg, D.

33214029,Risk Of Renal Cancer In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Pooled Analysis Of Population-Based Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, newer epidemiological studies report the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and risk of renal cancer (RCa). Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether IBD patients were associated with RCa risk.
METHODS: Various medical databases were searched from inception to April 2020. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled. The meta-analysis was completed by STATA version 14.2.
RESULTS: A total of 421 articles were identified, and 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data from 9 cohort studies showed a significantly increased risk of RCa in IBD patients (pooled SIR: 1.53; 95%CI: 1.25-1.80; I2 = 42.4%), especially for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled SIR: 1.95; 95%CI: 1.45-2.44; I2 = 39.9%). We did not observe a significantly increased risk of RCa in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (pooled SIR: 1.31; 95%CI: 0.94-1.67; I2 = 48.0%) when compared to the background population. Only 2 case-control studies reported the results of RCa risk, showing no significant difference between IBD group and IBD-free group (pooled RR: 1.64; 95%CI: 0.52-5.22; I2 = 77.9%).

Conventional therapeutic approaches often involve pharmacological interventions, which may have side effects and limited efficacy. Photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low-level light therapy, has emerged as a promising therapeutic or adjunctive alternative in the treatment of intestinal diseases. The search was conducted in the MEDLINE database via PubMed, SCOPUS, covering the period from 1990 to 2024. A total of 72 studies were selected, of which 9 focused on inflammatory bowel diseases IBD, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Among these studies, 1 was clinical protocol while eight experimental. The results showed that PBM has a significant positive effect in IBD studies in rats, with reduction of intestinal inflammation, improvement of mucosal integrity, and modulation of the immune response. However, no clinical studies were found necessary to obtain results and establish effective and safe treatment protocols. Nevertheless, PBM holds potential as a non-invasive and complementary therapeutic approach for managing IBD, offering new perspectives for the treatment of chronic intestinal diseases.

39642943,The Role Of Urine Metabolomics In The Diagnosis And Management Of Adult And Pediatric Crohn'S Disease And Ulcerative Colitis.,"INTRODUCTION: Urine metabolomics offers a non-invasive approach to diagnose and manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), by identifying distinct metabolic signatures.
OBJECTIVES: This narrative review summarizes current findings on urinary metabolites in IBD, evaluating their roles in disease differentiation, assessment of activity, and monitoring therapeutic response.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE up to October 2023 was conducted using keywords, such as 'urine metabolomics', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'Crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis', and 'urinary biomarkers'. Studies were included that described alterations to metabolic pathways, including those related to the urea cycle, central energy metabolism (Krebs cycle), amino acid metabolism, and neurotransmitters.
RESULTS: Specific urinary metabolites differentiate IBD patients from healthy controls and between CD and UC. Decreased urinary levels of hippurate, acetate, methanol, formate, and methylamine are observed in IBD, indicating altered gut microbiota. In CD patients, urea cycle alterations include reduced urinary urea and ornithine with increased arginine. Changes in Krebs cycle intermediates show decreased citrate and succinate in adults, but increased fumarate and isocitrate in pediatric patients, reflecting energy metabolism differences. Amino acid metabolism differs by age: Adults exhibit decreased urinary asparagine, lysine, and histidine, while pediatric patients show increased methionine, proline, aspartic acid, and isoleucine. Elevated urinary neurotransmitters like dopamine are noted in pediatric IBD patients. Urine metabolomics also can monitor treatment efficacy by distinguishing responders from non-responders to therapies and differentiating active disease from remission.

40913942,The Role Of Ct Colonography In The Assessment Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Patients.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, and its long-standing course significantly elevates the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), primarily arising from dysplastic lesions. While regular surveillance by colonoscopy is well established for UC patients, guidelines for CD remain uncertain. Computed Tomographic Colonography (CTC) offers a minimally invasive alternative for evaluating the colon, particularly in cases where colonoscopy is incomplete or contraindicated. Although not commonly utilized in IBD management, CTC provides substantial advantages in identifying complications such as fistulas, strictures, and colonic neoplasms. Additionally, it offers anatomical detail, which is crucial for surgical planning and decision-making. In this review we aim to demonstrate the usefulness of CTC in selected IBD cases, particularly in patients for whom colonoscopy is not feasible, and to show how its integration into clinical practice enhances decision-making and provides crucial insights into disease complications.",Leonardo M; Francesco C; Sarah M; Gloria Z; Piergiorgio D; Giovanni M; Andrea I; Nicola F,2025,European journal of radiology,192,,112397,10.1016/j.ejrad.2025.112397,"Leonardo, M., Francesco, C., Sarah, M., Gloria, Z., Piergiorgio, D., Giovanni, M., Andrea, I., & Nicola, F.

34616508,Microrna Expression In Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Colorectal Cancer.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules composed of 19-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression and play a central role in the regulation of several immune-mediated disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD, represented by ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is one of the most prevalent tumors in the world, and its main risk factors are obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, alcoholism, advanced age, and some eating habits, in addition to chronic intestinal inflammatory processes and the use of immunosuppressants administered to IBD patients. Recent studies have identified miRNAs associated with an increased risk of developing CRC in this population. The identification of miRNAs involved in this tumorigenic process could be useful to stratify cancer risk development for patients with IBD and to monitor and assess prognosis. Thus, the present review aimed to summarize the role of miRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of IBD-associated CRC. In the future, therapies based on miRNA modulation could be used both in clinical practice to achieve remission of the disease and restore the quality of life for patients with IBD, and to identify the patients with IBD at high risk for tumor development.",Grillo TG; Quaglio AEV; Beraldo RF; Lima TB; Baima JP; Di Stasi LC; Sassaki LY,2021,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,13,9,995-1016,10.4251/wjgo.v13.i9.995,"Grillo, T.

32545207,Review: Local Tumor Necrosis Factor-Α Inhibition In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by intestinal inflammation. Increased intestinal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are associated with disease activity and severity. Anti-TNF-α therapy is administered systemically and efficacious in the treatment of IBD. However, systemic exposure is associated with adverse events that may impede therapeutic treatment. Clinical studies show that the efficacy correlates with immunological effects localized in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) as opposed to systemic effects. These data suggest that site-specific TNF-α inhibition in IBD may be efficacious with fewer expected side effects related to systemic exposure. We therefore reviewed the available literature that investigated the efficacy or feasibility of local TNF-α inhibition in IBD. A literature search was performed on PubMed with given search terms and strategy. Of 8739 hits, 48 citations were included in this review. These studies ranged from animal studies to randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials. In these studies, local anti-TNF-α therapy was achieved with antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and genetically modified organisms. This narrative review summarizes and discusses these approaches in view of the clinical relevance of local TNF-α inhibition in IBD.",Gareb B; Otten AT; Frijlink HW; Dijkstra G; Kosterink JGW,2020,Pharmaceutics,12,6,,10.3390/pharmaceutics12060539,"Gareb, B., Otten, A.

32901590,Role Of Inflammation In The Development Of Colorectal Cancer.,"Chronic inflammation can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that includes both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohnmp's disease (CD) are risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Many cytokines produced primarily by the gut immune cells either during or in response to localized inflammation in the colon and rectum are known to stimulate the complex interactions between the different cell types in the gut environment resulting in acute inflammation. Subsequently, chronic inflammation, together with genetic and epigenetic changes, have been shown to lead to the development and progression of CRC. Various cell types present in the colon, such as enterocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells, and macrophages, express receptors for inflammatory cytokines and respond to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and other cytokines. Among the several cytokines produced, TNF-α and IL-1β are the key pro-inflammatory molecules that play critical roles in the development of CRC. The current review is intended to consolidate the published findings to focus on the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-α and IL-1β, on inflammation (and the altered immune response) in the gut, to better understand the development of CRC in IBD, using various experimental model systems, preclinical and clinical studies. Moreover, this review also highlights the current therapeutic strategies available (monotherapy and combination therapy) to alleviate the symptoms or treat inflammation-associated CRC by using monoclonal antibodies or aptamers to block pro-inflammatory molecules, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases in the inflammatory signaling cascade, competitive inhibitors of pro-inflammatory molecules, and the nucleic acid drugs like small activating RNAs (saRNAs) or microRNA (miRNA) mimics to activate tumor suppressor or repress oncogene/pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression.",Muthusami S; Ramachandran IK; Babu KN; Krishnamoorthy S; Guruswamy A; Queimado L; Chaudhuri G; Ramachandran I,2021,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",21,1,77-90,10.2174/1871530320666200909092908,"Muthusami, S., Ramachandran, I.

32940190,Regulation Of Micrornas In Inflammation-Associated Colorectal Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.,"The development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multistage process. The inflammation of the colon as in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) is often regarded as the initial trigger for the development of inflammation-associated CRC. Many cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (ILs) are known to exert proinflammatory actions, and inflammation initiates or promotes tumorigenesis of various cancers, including CRC, through differential regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs). miRNAs can be oncogenic miRNAs (oncomiRs) or anti-oncomiRs/tumor suppressor miRNAs, and they play key roles during colorectal carcinogenesis. However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of regulation of miRNAs involved in inflammation-associated CRC are still anecdotal and largely unknown. Consolidating the published results and offering perspective solutions to circumvent CRC, the current review is focused on the role of miRNAs and their regulation in the development of CRC. We have also discussed the model systems adapted by researchers to delineate the role of miRNAs in inflammation-associated CRC.",Muthusami S; Ramachandran I; Krishnamoorthy S; Sambandam Y; Ramalingam S; Queimado L; Chaudhuri G; Ramachandran IK,2021,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",21,1,67-76,10.2174/1871530320666200917112802,"Muthusami, S., Ramachandran, I., Krishnamoorthy, S., Sambandam, Y., Ramalingam, S., Queimado, L., Chaudhuri, G., & Ramachandran, I.

38369751,Plant-Derived Vesicle-Like Nanoparticles: A New Tool For Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Colitis-Associated Cancer Treatment.,"Long-term use of conventional drugs to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) has an adverse impact on the human immune system and easily leads to drug resistance, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel biotherapeutic tools with improved activity and limited side effects. Numerous products derived from plant sources have been shown to exert antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects. Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) are natural nanocarriers containing lipids, protein, DNA and microRNA (miRNA) with the ability to enter mammalian cells and regulate cellular activity. PDVLNs have significant potential in immunomodulation of macrophages, along with regulation of intestinal microorganisms and friendly antioxidant activity, as well as overcoming drug resistance. PDVLNs have utility as effective drug carriers and potential modification, with improved drug stability. Since immune function, intestinal microorganisms, and antioxidative stress are commonly targeted key phenomena in the treatment of IBD and CAC, PDVLNs offer a novel therapeutic tool. This review provides a summary of the latest advances in research on the sources and extraction methods, applications and mechanisms in IBD and CAC therapy, overcoming drug resistance, safety, stability, and clinical application of PDVLNs. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of PDVLN-based treatment of IBD and CAC are systematically discussed.",Fang X; Feng J; Zhu X; Feng D; Zheng L,2024,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,32,4,890-909,10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.02.021,"Fang, X., Feng, J., Zhu, X., Feng, D., & Zheng, L.

35887337,Micrornas As Innovative Biomarkers For Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Prediction Of Colorectal Cancer.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These are autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract with a chronic relapsing and remitting course. Due to complex interactions between multiple factors in the etiology of IBD, the discovery of new predictors of disease course and response to therapy, and the development of effective therapies is a significant challenge. The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of conserved endogenous, small non-coding RNA molecules with a length of 18-25 nucleotides, that regulate gene expression by an RNA interference process, is implicated in the complex pathogenetic context of IBD. Both tissue-derived, circulating, and fecal microRNAs have been explored as promising biomarkers in the diagnosis and the prognosis of disease severity of IBD. In this review, we summarize the expressed miRNA profile in blood, mucosal tissue, and stool and highlight the role of miRNAs as biomarkers with potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Moreover, we discuss the new perspectives in developing a new screening model for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on fecal miRNAs.",Masi L; Capobianco I; Magrì C; Marafini I; Petito V; Scaldaferri F,2022,International journal of molecular sciences,23,14,,10.3390/ijms23147991,"Masi, L., Capobianco, I., Magrì, C., Marafini, I., Petito, V., & Scaldaferri, F.

36470529,Dietary Interventions For The Treatment Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: An Updated Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study aimed (1) to systematically review controlled trials of solid food diets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and (2) to grade the overall quality of evidence.
METHODS: Systematic review of prospective controlled trials of solid food diets for the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD. Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and assessment of certainty of evidence. Meta-analyses were performed on studies with quantitative data on response, remission, and relapse.
RESULTS: There were 27 studies for meta-analysis. For induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD), low refined carbohydrate diet and symptoms-guided diet outperformed controls, but studies had serious imprecision and very low certainty of evidence. The Mediterranean diet was similar to the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (low certainty of evidence), and partial enteral nutrition (PEN) was similar to exclusive enteral nutrition (very low certainty of evidence). PEN reduced risk of relapse (very low certainty of evidence), whereas reduction of red meat or refined carbohydrates did not (low certainty of evidence). For ulcerative colitis, diets were similar to controls (very low and low certainty of evidence).
CONCLUSIONS: Among the most robust dietary trials in IBD currently available, certainty of evidence remains very low or low. Nonetheless, emerging data suggest potential benefit with PEN for induction and maintenance of remission in CD. Reduction of red meat and refined carbohydrates might not reduce risk of CD relapse. As more dietary studies become available, the certainty of evidence could improve, thus allowing for more meaningful recommendations for patients.",Limketkai BN; Godoy-Brewer G; Parian AM; Noorian S; Krishna M; Shah ND; White J; Mullin GE,2023,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,21,10,2508-2525.e10,10.1016/j.cgh.2022.11.026,"Limketkai, B.

36669515,Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases In Older Adults.,"The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in older adults (ie, aged over 60 years old) is increasing due to a combination of an ageing population with compounding prevalence of IBD and increasing incidence of elderly-onset (ie, onset over the age of 60 years) IBD. Despite the increasing prevalence of IBD, there is a paucity of evidence on which to base management of older adults with IBD, leading to substantial variability in care. This population is under-represented in clinical trials and has a high burden of chronic corticosteroid use, low uptake of steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents, and high rates of unplanned health-care use and disability. Management of IBD in older adults requires carefully weighing an individual patient's risk of IBD-related complications, IBD-directed immunosuppressive therapy, and non-IBD comorbidities. A deeper understanding of biological and functional age, dynamic risk stratification strategies (including frailty-based risk assessment tools), comparative effectiveness and safety of current therapies and treatment strategies, and shared decision making to inform treatment goals and targets is needed to improve outcomes in older adults with IBD. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and medical and surgical management of older individuals living with IBD and identify key research gaps and approaches to address them.",Singh S; Boland BS; Jess T; Moore AA,2023,The lancet.

We sought to estimate the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD on biologic therapies.
METHODS: We searched major databases from inception to June 2020 for studies estimating the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in IBD when using biologics (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF], anti-integrins, and anticytokines). Prevalence and relative risk (RR) were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis comprising 6963 patients. Biologic therapy in IBD pregnancies was associated with a pooled prevalence of 8% (95% CI, 6%-10%; I2 = 87.4%) for early pregnancy loss, 9% (95% CI, 7%-11%; I2 = 89.9%) for preterm birth, 0% (95% CI, 0%-0%; I2 = 0%) for stillbirth, 8% (95% CI, 5%-10%; I2 = 87.0%) for low birth weight, and 1% (95% CI, 1%-2%; I2 = 78.3%) for congenital malformations. These rates are comparable with those published in the general population. In subgroup analyses of a small number of studies, the prevalence of early pregnancy loss and preterm birth were higher in vedolizumab vs anti-TNF users. Meta-regression did not show an association of disease activity or concomitant thiopurine on adverse outcomes. Continued TNF inhibitor use during the third trimester was not associated with risk of preterm birth (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.77-2.60; I2 = 0%), low birth weight (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.80-2.18; I2 = 0%), or congenital malformations (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.47-3.49; I2 = 0%).

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the risk of serious infections with advanced therapies in active comparator studies.
METHODS: Through a systematic search until February 28, 2022, we included 20 head-to-head studies comparing risk of serious infections with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonists, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, filgotinib, and ozanimod in patients with IBD. We performed random-effects meta-analysis comparing different advanced therapies.
RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the risk of serious infections between vedolizumab vs TNFα antagonists in all patients with IBD (17 cohorts: odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68-1.04), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 37%); on subgroup analysis, vedolizumab was associated with a lower risk of serious infections in patients with ulcerative colitis (11 cohorts: OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83; I2 = 0%), but not in Crohn's disease (CD) (9 cohorts: OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.78-1.35; I2 = 42%). Age, sex, prior biologic exposure, and use of biologic monotherapy did not influence this association. In patients with CD, ustekinumab was associated with a lower risk of serious infections vs TNFα antagonists (3 cohorts: OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.93; I2 = 16%) and vs vedolizumab (3 cohorts: OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.93; I2 = 67%).

39056556,Using Diet To Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: To review the efficacy of various dietary interventions for induction of clinical remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and provide healthcare providers with a practical reference for recommending suitable diets for managing patients with IBD.
METHODS: PubMed, Medline(R), and Cochrane were searched from inception up to February 17, 2023, to identify all studies reporting information on using diet to treat IBD. Studies investigating the role of dietary interventions in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of active IBD for improvement or remission of IBD symptoms were rigorously considered. Sample meal plans, with a list of included and excluded foods, were also generated to provide clinicians with practical tools for advising patients on dietary intake.
RESULTS: Eleven included studies provided data on 10 distinct diets: autoimmune protocol diet, high-fiber diet, 4-strategies-to-SUlfide-Reduction diet, highly restricted diet, McMaster elimination diet for Crohn's disease, specific carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, Crohn's disease exclusion diet, individualized elimination diet, and the food-specific IgG4-guided exclusion diet. A total of 9 studies provided data on clinical remission. Many of these diets share common elements, such as an initial elimination phase with subsequent reintroduction of dietary components, inclusion of whole foods, and exclusion of highly or ultraprocessed foods.
DISCUSSION: Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of specific diets to treat adult patients with mildly to moderately active IBD. Larger, randomized studies with standardized methodologies and outcome measures, rigorous adherence assessment, and an emphasis on endoscopic assessment outcome measures are required to validate most diets that have been studied for IBD. The included sample diet plans and dietary recommendations may prove helpful in the interim as part of a holistic strategy to manage patients with IBD.",Gleave A; Shah A; Tahir U; Blom JJ; Dong E; Patel A; Marshall JK; Narula N,2025,The American journal of gastroenterology,120,1,83-97,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002973,"Gleave, A., Shah, A., Tahir, U., Blom, J.

Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism.

33537791,Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Preoperative Vedolizumab And Postoperative Complications In Patients With Ibd.,"OBJECTIVES: The effect of vedolizumab on postoperative outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. We aimed to determine the relation between preoperative vedolizumab and early postoperative complications in patients with IBD undergoing abdominal surgery.
METHODS: A search of databases and abstracts from gastroenterology conferences was performed. Primary outcomes included overall and infectious postoperative complication rates as well as surgical site infections. Studies that compared Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or patients with IBD-undefined with preoperative vedolizumab treatment undergoing abdominal surgery with controls with preoperative antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) treatment or no preoperative biologic treatment were included. A meta-analysis was completed using the Mantel-Haenszel and DerSimonian and Laird models.
RESULTS: Six studies totaling 1201 patients were included; 281 patients were treated preoperatively with vedolizumab, 327 patients were treated preoperatively with anti-TNF-α agents, and 593 patients were not treated preoperatively with any biologics. There was no significant difference in overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-2.24, P = 0.92, I2 =77%) between the vedolizumab and no-biologic groups. There also was no significant difference in infectious complications (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.37-2.69, P = 1.00, I2 = 78%), which persisted after sensitivity analysis (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.31-1.60, P = 0.41, I2 = 46%). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in overall complications (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.24-2.46, P = 0.66, I2 = 85%) and infectious complications (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.20-3.94, P = 0.87, I2 = 86%) between the vedolizumab and anti-TNF-α groups. After sensitivity analysis, differences in overall and infectious complications remained insignificant (OR 0.54 and 0.50, 95% CI 0.24-1.17 and 0.22-1.15, P = 0.12 and 0.10, I2 = 39% and 18%, respectively). Vedolizumab was also not associated with a significant increase in surgical site infections compared with the no-biologic (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.33-6.32, P = 0.62, I2 = 75%) and anti-TNF (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.22-7.60, P = 0.77, I2 = 81%) groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative treatment with vedolizumab in patients with IBD undergoing abdominal surgery is not associated with increases in overall or infectious postoperative complications compared with preoperative anti-TNF-α treatment and no preoperative biologic treatment. Large, prospective studies are needed to further assess the impact of preoperative vedolizumab treatment on postoperative complications, particularly with respect to IBD subtype.",Moosvi Z; Duong JT; Bechtold ML; Nguyen DL,2021,Southern medical journal,114,2,98-105,10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001214,"Moosvi, Z., Duong, J.

37543040,Efficacy Of Psychological Therapies In People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence for an influence of the gut-brain axis on the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Psychological therapies could, therefore, have beneficial effects in individuals with IBD, but data are conflicting. We aimed to update our previous systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether the inclusion of more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed any beneficial effects and whether these effects varied by treatment modality.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from Jan 1, 2016, to April 30, 2023, for RCTs published in any language recruiting individuals aged 16 years or older with IBD that compared psychological therapy with a control intervention or treatment as usual. We pooled dichotomous data to obtain relative risks (RR) with 95% CIs of inducing remission in people with active disease or of relapse in people with quiescent disease at final follow-up. We pooled continuous data to estimate standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs in disease activity indices, anxiety scores, depression scores, stress scores, and quality-of-life scores at completion of therapy and at final follow-up. We pooled all data using a random-effects model. Trials were analysed separately according to whether they recruited people with clinically active IBD or predominantly individuals whose disease was quiescent. We conducted subgroup analyses by mode of therapy and according to whether trials recruited selected groups of people with IBD. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess bias at the study level and assessed funnel plots using the Egger test. We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic.
FINDINGS: The updated literature search identified a total of 469 new records, 11 of which met eligibility criteria. 14 studies were included from our previous meta-analysis published in 2017. In total, 25 RCTs were eligible for this meta-analysis, all of which were at high risk of bias. Only four RCTs recruited patients with active IBD; there were insufficient data for meta-analysis of remission, disease activity indices, depression scores, and stress scores. In patients with active IBD, psychological therapy had no benefit compared with control for anxiety scores at completion of therapy (two RCTs; 79 people; SMD -1·04, 95% CI -2·46 to 0·39), but did have significant benefit for quality-of-life scores at completion of therapy (four RCTs; 309 people; 0·68, 0·09 to 1·26), although heterogeneity between studies was high (I2=82%). In individuals with quiescent IBD, RR of relapse of disease activity was not reduced with psychological therapy (ten RCTs; 861 people; RR 0·83, 95% CI 0·62 to 1·12), with moderate heterogeneity (I2=60%), and the funnel plot suggested evidence of publication bias or other small study effects (Egger test p=0·046). For people with quiescent IBD at completion of therapy, there was no difference in disease activity indices between psychological therapy and control (13 RCTs; 1015 people; SMD -0·01, 95% CI -0·13 to 0·12; I2=0%). Anxiety scores (13 RCTs; 1088 people; -0·23, -0·36 to -0·09; 18%), depression scores (15 RCTs; 1189 people; -0·26, -0·38 to -0·15; 2%), and stress scores (11 RCTs; 813 people; -0·22, -0·42 to -0·03; 47%) were significantly lower, and quality-of-life scores (16 RCTs; 1080 people; 0·31, 0·16 to 0·46; 30%) were significantly higher, with psychological therapy versus control at treatment completion. Statistically significant benefits persisted up to final follow-up for depression scores (12 RCTs; 856 people; -0·16, -0·30 to -0·03; 0%). Effects were strongest in RCTs of third-wave therapies and in RCTs that recruited people with impaired psychological health, fatigue, or reduced quality of life at baseline.
INTERPRETATION: Psychological therapies have beneficial, short-term effects on anxiety, depression, stress, and quality-of-life scores, but not on disease activity. Further RCTs in selected groups are needed to establish the place for such therapies in IBD care.

34797516,Anti-Drug Antibody Formation Against Biologic Agents In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immunogenicity with formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to biologics is an important reason for treatment failure in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to assess the rate of ADA, the effect of combination therapy with immunomodulators on ADA and the influence of ADA on efficacy and safety of biologics for IBD treatment.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from inception to April 2020 for trials of biologics that assessed immunogenicity. The overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). The primary outcome was rate of ADA. Secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety outcomes among patients with detectable versus undetectable ADA. For dichotomous outcomes, pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: Data from 68 studies were analyzed and 33 studies (5850 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled ADA rates for biologic monotherapy were 28.0% for infliximab, 7.5% for adalimumab, 3.8% for golimumab, 10.9% for certolizumab, 6.2% for ustekinumab and 16.0% for natalizumab. Pooled ADA rates were 8.4% for vedolizumab and 5.0% for etrolizumab for combo- and monotherapy combined. In all biologics, ADA rates were underestimated by use of drug-sensitive ADA assays and higher dose and/or frequency. ADA rate was significantly reduced in patients treated with combination therapy for infliximab (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.44-0.62), adalimumab (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.14-0.69), golimumab (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.10-0.83), certolizumab pegol (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14-0.67) and natalizumab (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.11-0. 39). ADA to infliximab were associated with lower clinical response rates (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.61-0.91) and higher rates of infusion reactions (RR 2.36; 95% CI 1.85-3.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in analytical methods to detect ADA hamper comparison of true ADA rates across biologics in IBD. Use of combination therapy with immunomodulators appeared to reduce ADA positivity for most biologics. For infliximab, ADA were associated with reduced drug efficacy and increased adverse events.",Bots SJ; Parker CE; Brandse JF; Löwenberg M; Feagan BG; Sandborn WJ; Jairath V; D'Haens G; Vande Casteele N,2021,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",35,6,715-733,10.1007/s40259-021-00507-5,"Bots, S.

34323292,Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis: Dietary Intake In Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Poor dietary intake is associated with the development of malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, anaemia and osteoporosis in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. While trials are underway to manipulate the diet of people with IBD, there has been no comprehensive systematic review of the dietary intake of adults with IBD.
AIMS: To conduct a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the dietary intake of adults with IBD, including macronutrients, micronutrients and food group data.
METHODS: CINAHL, Embase, Medline and Scopus were searched from 1 January 2000 to 25 September 2020 for cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies that reported usual dietary intake in adults. Data were pooled and reported as weighted mean intake for: all adults with IBD; Crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; active disease; remission; males; females. A random-effects meta-analysis model compared intake with healthy individuals.
RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and 19 were included in the meta-analysis. All subgroups of adults with IBD consumed inadequate energy (mean intake in adults with IBD 1980 ± 130 kcal), fibre (14 ± 4 g), folate (246 ± 33 mg) and calcium (529 ± 114 mg) per day. Intake of breads and cereals, legumes, fruit, vegetables and dairy were inadequate. Compared to healthy individuals, adults with IBD consume significantly less dietary fibre (SMD -0.59; 95% CI: -0.73, -0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides improved clarity about the dietary intake of adults with IBD. Future attention is required to improve diet quality and increase understanding of factors influencing dietary intake in IBD.",Lambert K; Pappas D; Miglioretto C; Javadpour A; Reveley H; Frank L; Grimm MC; Samocha-Bonet D; Hold GL,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,6,742-754,10.1111/apt.16549,"Lambert, K., Pappas, D., Miglioretto, C., Javadpour, A., Reveley, H., Frank, L., Grimm, M.

34467414,Association Between Vedolizumab And Postoperative Complications In Ibd: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of preoperative vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy on postoperative complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is still controversial. This meta-analysis aims to review postoperative complications of IBD patients who preoperatively received VDZ.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of the available literature was performed. Studies of IBD patients who received VDZ and non-VDZ therapy (including anti-TNF-α agents, non-biological therapy, other biological agents, ustekinumab, and placebo) before surgery were included. Primary outcomes included overall complications, infectious complications, and non-infectious complications.
RESULTS: Twelve studies with 1925 IBD patients were enrolled, among which 709 patients received VDZ treatment. The results show that, compared with non-VDZ treatment, there is no significant difference in the incidence of overall complications (OR = 1.25, p = 0.43) for adult IBD patients treated with VDZ preoperatively, the incidence of infectious complications (OR = 0.49, p = 0.001) decreases, but the risks of all surgical site infection (SSI) (Crohn's disease (CD): OR = 2.97, p < 0.001), superficial surgical site infection (sSSI) (OR = 2.24, p = 0.02), and ileus (OR = 2.16, p < 0.001) increase. The risk of mucocutaneous separation (MCS) (OR = 4.69, p = 0.03) with VDZ is also higher than non-VDZ. Two studies involved pediatric patients and showed no difference in ileus (OR = 0.55, p = 0.55).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, compared with non-VDZ treatment, preoperative use of VDZ is relatively safer in adult IBD patients, which does not increase the risk of overall postoperative complications and reduces the occurrence of infectious complications. But, it increases the risk of all SSI and sSSI in infectious complications and the incidence of ileus and MCS in non-infectious complications. Due to lack of sufficient data, the safety of VDZ in pediatric patients is uncertain and requires further study.",Guo D; Jiang K; Hong J; Zhang M; Shi Y; Zhou B,2021,International journal of colorectal disease,36,10,2081-2092,10.1007/s00384-021-04017-2,"Guo, D., Jiang, K., Hong, J., Zhang, M., Shi, Y., & Zhou, B.

36494448,Inflammatory Bowel Disease And Covid-19 Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis.,"There is conflicting evidence concerning the effect of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on COVID-19 incidence and outcome. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the published evidence through a systematic review process and perform a meta-analysis to assess the association between IBD and COVID-19. A compressive literature search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 2021. A snowball search in Google, Google Scholar, Research Gate, and MedRxiv; and bibliographic research were also performed to identify any other relevant articles. Quantitative observational studies such as cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that assessed the incidence, risk, and outcomes of COVID-19 among the adult IBD patients published in the English language, were considered for this review. The incidence and risk of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, the severity of COVID-19, and mortality were considered as the outcomes of interest. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used for quality assessment. A subgroup and sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the heterogeneity and robustness of the results, respectively. A total of 86 studies out of 2828 non-duplicate records were considered for this meta-analysis. The studies were single or multicentric internationally from settings such as IBD centres, medical colleges, hospitals, or from the general public. Most of the studies were observed to be of good quality with an acceptable risk of bias. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, severe COVID-19, and mortality in the IBD population were 6.10%, 10.63%, 40.43%, and 1.94%, respectively. IBD was not significantly (p > 0.05) associated with the risk of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, severe COVID-19, and mortality. In contrast, ulcerative colitis was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 (OR 1.37; p = 0.01), COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 1.28; p < 0.00001), and severe COVID-19 (OR 2.45; p < 0.0007). Crohn's disease was significantly associated with a lesser risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 0.48; p = 0.02). Type of IBD was a potential factor that might have contributed to the higher level of heterogeneity. There was a significant association between ulcerative colitis and increased risk of COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, and severe COVID-19 infection. This association was not observed in patients with Crohns' disease or in those diagnosed non-specifically as IBD.",Abdulla M; Mohammed N; AlQamish J; Mosli M,2022,Scientific reports,12,1,21333,10.1038/s41598-022-25429-2,"Abdulla, M., Mohammed, N., AlQamish, J., & Mosli, M.

32170782,Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis: Biologics And Risk Of Infection Or Cancer In Elderly Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists concerning the risk of infection and cancer associated with biologic therapies in elderly patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
AIMS: To identify, synthesise and critically appraise the available evidence on the topic.
METHODS: We systematically searched Medline/PubMed, Embase and Scopus, through October 2019, and recent conference proceedings, to identify studies investigating the risk of serious infections, opportunistic infections, any infection and cancer in elderly IBD patients (>60 years) exposed to biologics as compared to those unexposed to biologics. Two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed each study's risk of bias. We examined heterogeneity, and calculated summary effect estimates using fixed- and random effects models. Quality of evidence was determined with GRADE.
RESULTS: We included 15 studies (one post hoc analysis of a randomised trial, nine cohort and five case-control studies). Elderly IBD patients treated with biologics were at increased risk of developing serious infections (random effects summary relative risk: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.56-4.66; seven studies; I2 = 57%) and opportunistic infections (3.16, 1.09-9.20; four studies; I2 = 73%). The occurrence of any infection (1.67, 0.51-5.43; five studies; I2 = 75%) and cancer (0.90, 0.64-1.26; nine studies; I2 = 0%) was not significantly affected. Nevertheless, our confidence in the effect estimates is rather limited; the quality of evidence is low to very low.

32485355,Effect Of Trichinella Spp. Or Derived Antigens On Chemically Induced Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd) In Mouse Models: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Trichinella or derived antigens have been suggested to be potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to estimate the effect of Trichinella or derived antigens on chemically induced IBD.
METHODS: Studies were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct from inception to February 2020. We included articles written in English that investigated the effect of Trichinella infection and/or derived products in mouse models of IBD. Studies were pooled, and the combined standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect or fixed-effect model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eventually included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated significant differences in the disease activity index (DAI), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, macroscopic inflammation score, and microscopic inflammation score between the experimental group and the control group. The anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), IL-10 and IL-13 were significantly increased in the experimental group compared with the control group, whereas the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 were significantly decreased. The percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells was also significantly increased, while the level of the M1 phenotypic macrophage marker iNOS was significantly decreased and the expression of the M2 phenotypic macrophage marker Arg-1 was significantly increased.

33375314,Predefined Diets In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease mediated by the immune system and characterized by the importance of diet in pathological development. This study aims to understand how the use of predefined diets can affect the adult population diagnosed with IBD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. From the different databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, LILACS, CINAHL, and WOS), we found 4195 registers. After a review process, only 31 research studies were selected for qualitative synthesis and 10 were selected for meta-analysis. The variables used were Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) and fecal calprotectin (FC), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and albumin (ALB) for patients with IBD. Predefined diets have been shown to have partial efficacy for the treatment of IBD and are compatible with other medical treatments. CDAI improved but with reasonable doubts due to the high heterogeneity of the data, while no differences were observed for ALB, FC, and CRP. More studies that evaluate the influence of predefined diets on IBD patients are needed due to the great variability in diets and the tools used to measure their effects.",Comeche JM; Gutierrez-Hervás A; Tuells J; Altavilla C; Caballero P,2020,Nutrients,13,1,,10.3390/nu13010052,"Comeche, J.

39920373,Bariatric Surgery And Relevant Comorbidities: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing epidemic in the United States, and with this, has come an increasing volume of metabolic surgery operations. The ideal management of obesity-associated medical conditions surrounding these operations is yet to be determined. This review sought to investigate the routine use of intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) with cholecystectomy during or after a bypass-type operation, the ideal management of post-sleeve gastrectomy gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the optimal bariatric operation in patients with known inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Using medical literature databases, searches were performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies from 1990 to 2022. Each study was screened by two independent reviewers from the SAGES Guidelines Committee for eligibility. Data were extracted while assessing the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for RCTs and cohort studies, respectively. A meta-analysis was performed using random effects.
RESULTS: Routine use of IOC was associated with a significantly decreased rate of common bile duct injury and a trend towards decreased intraoperative complications, perioperative complications, and mortality. The rates of reoperation, postoperative pancreatitis, cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis were low in the routine use of the IOC group, but no non-routine use studies evaluated these outcomes. After sleeve gastrectomy, GERD-specific quality of life was significantly higher in the surgically treated group compared to the medically treated group. Bypass-type operations had worse outcomes of IBD sequelae than sleeve gastrectomy, including pain, patient perception, and fistula formation. Sleeve patients had lower mortality and fewer short- and long-term complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality data limited the conclusions that were drawn; however, trends were observed favoring the routine use of IOC during cholecystectomy for patients with bypass-type anatomy, surgical treatment of GERD post-sleeve gastrectomy, and sleeve gastrectomy in IBD patients. Future research proposals are suggested to further answer the questions posed.",Wunker C; Kumar S; Hallowell P; Collings A; Loss L; Bansal V; Kushner B; Zoumpou T; Kindel TL; Overby DW; Chang J; Ayloo S; Sabour AF; Ghanem OM; Aleassa E; Reid A; Rodriguez N; Haskins IN; Hilton LR; Slater BJ; Palazzo F,2025,Surgical endoscopy,39,3,1419-1448,10.1007/s00464-025-11528-4,"Wunker, C., Kumar, S., Hallowell, P., Collings, A., Loss, L., Bansal, V., Kushner, B., Zoumpou, T., Kindel, T.

32865278,Intestinal Cancer In Patients With Crohn'S Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although surveillance colonoscopy is recommended by several guidelines for Crohn's disease (CD), the evidence is insufficient to support the validity of this recommendation. Moreover, the efficacy of surveillance colonoscopy for anorectal cancer remains unclear. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of cancer in patients with CD before considering the proper surveillance methods.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the incidence of intestinal cancer and a literature review to clarify the characteristic features of cancer in CD. We performed the systematic literature review of studies published up to May 2019.
RESULTS: Overall, 7344 patients were included in eight studies. The standardized incidence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of colorectal cancer (CRC) and small bowel cancer (SBC) were 2.08 (1.43-3.02) and 22.01 (9.10-53.25), respectively. The prevalence of CRC and SBC was 57/7344 (0.77%) and 17/7344 (0.23%), respectively, during a median follow-up of 12.55 years. Additionally, 54 studies reporting 208 anorectal cancer cases were identified. In patients with anorectal cancer, the prognosis for survival was 2.1 ± 2.3 years, and advanced cancer greater than stage T3 occurred in 46/74 patients (62.1%). Many more reports of anorectal cancer were published in Asia than in Western countries.
CONCLUSION: Although we were unable to state a recommendation for surveillance for SBC, we should perform cancer surveillance for CRC in patients with CD. However, the characteristics of cancer may differ according to geography or race. We must establish proper and effective surveillance methods that are independently suitable to detect these differences.",Uchino M; Ikeuchi H; Hata K; Minagawa T; Horio Y; Kuwahara R; Nakamura S; Watanabe K; Saruta M; Fujii T; Kobayashi T; Sugimoto K; Hirai F; Esaki M; Hiraoka S; Matsuoka K; Shinzaki S; Matsuura M; Inoue N; Nakase H; Watanabe M,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,2,329-336,10.1111/jgh.15229,"Uchino, M., Ikeuchi, H., Hata, K., Minagawa, T., Horio, Y., Kuwahara, R., Nakamura, S., Watanabe, K., Saruta, M., Fujii, T., Kobayashi, T., Sugimoto, K., Hirai, F., Esaki, M., Hiraoka, S., Matsuoka, K., Shinzaki, S., Matsuura, M., Inoue, N., Nakase, H., & Watanabe, M.

35906528,De Novo Inflammatory Bowel Disease Following Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The incidence of both obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rising globally. The influence of bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS) upon IBD development is largely unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMS and the risk of de novo IBD development following surgery. A systematic literature search and meta-analysis were performed using PubMed and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria were any study reporting risk of de novo IBD development following BMS relative to an appropriate control cohort. Pooled odds ratios (POR) were calculated. A total of 31 articles were identified by the literature search. Four studies including 149,385 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimation of a meta-analysis of risk ratios studies demonstrated a POR for the development of IBD following BMS of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.06-1.29). This indicates a 17% increase in relative risk of de novo IBD development for those patients receiving BMS compared to those treated by non-surgical methods. Based on the present data, there appears to be an association between BMS and risk of de novo IBD. Compared to the proven benefits of BMS on other aspects of patient health, this potential risk remains proportionally low but may be an important consideration for patients both pre- and post-operatively.",Kermansaravi M; Valizadeh R; Farazmand B; Mousavimaleki A; Taherzadeh M; Wiggins T; Singhal R,2022,Obesity surgery,32,10,3426-3434,10.1007/s11695-022-06226-2,"Kermansaravi, M., Valizadeh, R., Farazmand, B., Mousavimaleki, A., Taherzadeh, M., Wiggins, T., & Singhal, R.

37099723,Management Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Using E-Health Technologies: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Technological advances have provided innovative, adaptive, and responsive models of care for inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD]. We conducted a systematic review to compare e-health interventions with standard care in management of IBD.
METHODS: We searched electronic databases for randomised, controlled trials [RCT] comparing e-health interventions with standard care for patients with IBD. Effect measures were standardised mean difference [SMD], odds ratio [OR], or rate ratio [RR], calculated using the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel statistical method and random-effects models. Version 2 of the Cochrane tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was appraised with the GRADE framework.
RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs [n = 3111; 1754 e-health and 1357 controls] were identified. The difference in disease activity scores (SMD 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.09-0.28) and clinical remission (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI: 0.78-1.61) between e-health interventions and standard care were not statistically significant. Higher quality of life [QoL] [SMD 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.35) and IBD knowledge [SMD 0.23, 95% CI: 0.10-0.36] scores were noted in the e-health group, and self-efficacy levels [SMD -0.09, 95% CI: -0.22-0.05] were comparable. E-health patients had fewer office [RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.93] and emergency [RR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51- 0.95] visits, with no statistically significant difference in endoscopic procedures, total health care encounters, corticosteroid use, and IBD related hospitalisation or surgery. The trials were judged to be at high risk of bias or to have some concerns for disease remission. The certainty of evidence was moderate or low.

36789751,Safety Analysis Of Preoperative Anti-Tnf-Α Therapy In Pediatric Ibd After Intestinal Resection: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Biological agents have transformed the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, intestinal resection is still unavoidable in complicated IBD. It is still under debate whether antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is related to higher postoperative complications in children with IBD. Therefore, we aimed to analyze data on preoperative anti-TNF-α and postoperative complications in pediatric IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in 4 databases for studies that compared the incidence of postoperative complications between children with IBD who received anti-TNF-α treatment within 12 weeks prior to intestinal resection and who did not receive anti-TNF-α before the operation. To analyze this question, pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Odds ratios higher than 1 mean higher complication rate among children treated with preoperative anti-TNF-α, whereas an OR lower than 1 means lower complication rate. The I2 value was calculated to measure the strength of the between-study heterogeneity, where a smaller percentage means the lower heterogeneity.
RESULTS: We found 8 eligible articles with 526 pediatric patients with IBD. The primary outcome was the overall complication. The pooled OR of overall complications was 1.38 (95% CI, 0.10-18.76; P = .65; I2 = 34%) in contrast, the OR of infectious and noninfectious complications were 0.59 (95% CI, 0.21-1.69; P = .16; I2 = 0%) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.18-1.25; p = .09; I2 = 0%), although both showed a nonsignificant result.
CONCLUSION: There is no significant association between preoperative anti-TNF-α therapy and postoperative complications in children with IBD after intestinal resection.

36504172,Covid-19 Susceptibility And Clinical Outcomes In Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Updated Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The susceptibility, risk factors, and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unknown. Thus, our study aims to assess the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in IBD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and medRxiv from 2019 to 1 June 2022 for cohort and case-control studies comparing the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD and in the general population. We also compared the outcomes of patients receiving and not receiving 5-aminosalicylates (ASA), tumour necrosis factor antagonists, biologics, systemic corticosteroids, or immunomodulators for IBD. Thirty five studies were eligible for our analysis. Pooled odds ratio of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death in IBD compared to in non-IBD were 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-1.18), 1.09 (95% CI = 0.27-4.47), and 0.67 (95% CI = 0.32-1.42), respectively. Inflammatory bowel disease was not associated with increased hospitalisation, ICU admission, or death. Susceptibility to COVID-19 did not increase with any drugs for IBD. Hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death were more likely with 5-ASA and corticosteroid use. COVID-19-related hospitalisation (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.53; 95% CI = 0.38-0.74) and death (OR: 0.13; 95% CI = 0.13-0.70) were less likely with Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis (UC).

36100800,Vitamin D Therapy In Pediatric Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There is some evidence for the role of vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the pediatric population. However, the results are contradictory. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluated the effect of vitamin D on pediatric patients with IBD.
METHODS: We carried out a systematic search in databases from inception until 20 January 2022. We included all relevant articles that evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D on disease activity, inflammatory factors, and vitamin D and calcium levels in pediatric patients with IBD. Random effects models were used to combine the data. The main outcomes were then analyzed using weight mean difference (WMD) and respective 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Fifteen treatment arms met the eligibility criteria and were included. Pooled estimates indicated that intervention with vitamin D has a significantly beneficial effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH) D3] (pooled WMD of 17.662 ng/mL; CI 9.77-25.46; P < 0.001), calcium (pooled WMD of 0.17 mg/dL; CI 0.04-0.30; P = 0.009), and inflammatory factors including C-reactive protein (CRP) (pooled WMD of -6.57 mg/L; CI -11.47 to -1.67; P = 0.009) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (pooled WMD of -7.94 mm/h; CI -12.65 to -3.22; P = 0.001) levels. In addition, this effect was greater for vitamin D levels at doses greater than 2000 IU, and when follow-up duration was more than 12 weeks.

33235125,Heart Rate Variability And Inflammatory Bowel Disease In Humans: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"The autonomic nervous system (ANS) maintains homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract, including immunity, inflammation and motility, through the brain-gut axis. To date, the associations between ANS function and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been controversial and inconclusive in human studies. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched through February 2020 for articles reporting these association between heart rate variability (HRV), an indirect measure of ANS activity, and IBD. The standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Ten eligible studies involving 273 ulcerative colitis patients, 167 Crohn's disease patients and 208 healthy controls were included. The values of the total power (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI = -1.44, -0.21), high frequency (SMD = -0.79, 95% CI = -1.20, -0.38), RR interval (SMD = -0.66, 95% CI = -1.04, -0.27), standard deviation of the RR intervals (SMD = -1.00, 95% CI = -1.73, -0.27), percentage of RR intervals with a greater than 50-millisecond variation (SMD = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.33, -0.30) and the square root of the mean squared differences in successive RR intervals (SMD = -0.71, 95% CI = -1.15, -0.26) of the IBD patients were lower than those of the healthy controls, and moderate to large effect sizes were observed in all HRV indices, except for low frequency (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI = 0.95, 0.13). IBD was strongly associated with an overall decrease in HRV, indicating substantially decreased ANS activity.

35382972,Safety Of Sars-Cov-2 Vaccination In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Risk of adverse effects and flare of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are frequently cited reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify studies reporting the use of COVID-19 vaccine in IBD. We selected studies reporting the incidence of various adverse effects (local or systemic) and flares of IBD after COVID-19 vaccination. The pooled incidence rates for various adverse effects, stratified for the dose and the type of vaccine (adenoviral or mRNA) were estimated.
RESULTS: Nine studies (16 vaccination cohorts) were included. The pooled incidence rate of overall adverse events was 0.55 (95%CI, 0.45-0.64, I2= 95%). The pooled incidence rate of local adverse events was 0.64 (0.47-0.78, I2= 100%). The pooled incidence rates of fatigue, headache, myalgia, fever and chills were 0.30 (0.21-0.40, I2= 99%), 0.23 (0.17-0.30, I2= 99%), 0.18 (0.13-0.24, I2= 99%), 0.10 (0.06-0.17, I2= 98%) and 0.15 (0.06-0.3, I2= 86%), respectively.

36454911,Effects Of Structured Exercise Programmes On Physiological And Psychological Outcomes In Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd): A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Exercise has been suggested to counteract specific complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, its role as a therapeutic option remains poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of exercise in IBD.
METHODS: Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and SPORTDiscus) and three registers (Clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and ISRCTN) were searched from inception to September 2022, for studies assessing the effects of structured exercise of at least 4 weeks duration on physiological and/or psychological outcomes in adults with IBD. Two independent reviewers screened records, assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2.0) and ROBINS-I tools, and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE method. Data were meta-analysed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: From 4,123 citations, 15 studies (9 RCTs) were included, comprising of 637 participants (36% male). Pooled evidence from six RCTs indicated that exercise improved disease activity (SMD = -0.44; 95% CI [-0.82 to -0.07]; p = 0.02), but not disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (IBDQ total score; MD = 3.52; -2.00 to 9.04; p = 0.21) when compared to controls. Although meta-analysis could not be performed for other outcomes, benefits were identified in fatigue, muscular function, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, bone mineral density and psychological well-being. Fourteen exercise-related non-serious adverse events occurred. The overall certainty of evidence was low for disease activity and very low for HRQOL as a result of downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.
CONCLUSIONS: Structured exercise programmes improve disease activity, but not disease-specific QOL. Defining an optimal exercise prescription and synthesis of evidence in other outcomes, was limited by insufficient well-designed studies to ascertain the true effect of exercise training. This warrants further large-scale randomised trials employing standard exercise prescription to verify this effect to enable the implementation into clinical practice.

33002235,Does Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Prevent The Recurrence Of Crohn'S Disease? Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α agents are now well known to function as effective treatments for Crohn's disease (CD). Several meta-analyses have revealed the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy for preventing recurrence after surgery; however, the efficacies reported in some prospective studies differed according to the outcomes. Moreover, adverse events (AEs) were not well evaluated. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate both the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy after stratification by the outcome of interest and the AEs.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of studies investigating anti-TNF therapy, CD, and postoperative recurrence. Meta-analyses were performed for endoscopic and clinical recurrence and AEs.
RESULTS: A total of 570 participants, including 254 patients in the intervention group and 316 patients in the control group, in eight studies, were analyzed for recurrence. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, the efficacies of anti-TNF therapy at preventing endoscopic and clinical recurrence were as follows: relative risk (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.53 and RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-1.02, respectively. The RR of AEs with anti-TNF therapy was 1.75 (95% CI 0.81-3.79).
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy after surgery for CD displays efficacy at preventing endoscopic recurrence for 1-2 years, without increasing the incidence of AEs. However, clinical recurrence was not significantly reduced.

39533176,"The Efficacy Of Ct-P13, A Biosimilar Of Infliximab, In Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Since 2015, an infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, has been approved for commercial use in many countries, easing the economic burden borne by society and patients. Many clinical trials investigating CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD have been conducted and reported that it may be a substitute for infliximab. However, the differences between the efficacy of CT-P13 and infliximab-originator require further elucidation.
METHODS: Data on the rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing of IBD were pooled for random-effects model meta-analysis using Stata MP 17. A total of 30 studies were included.
RESULTS: The pooled risk of clinical remission rate of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis who were naïve to biologics at 08-14 weeks were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58-0.75) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.43-0.54), respectively, and at 100-104 weeks were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.84) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.79) respectively. The pooled risk of clinical remission rate of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis who were transitioned from the original agent at 24-32 weeks were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.92) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.63-0.93), respectively, and at 48-54 weeks were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.86) respectively. The pooled rates for mucosal healing in ulcerative colitis were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.46 to 0.67) at 08-14 weeks, and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.85) at 48-54 weeks. RCT studies showed no significant change in efficacy after switching, whether Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

31447293,An Increase In Prostate Cancer Diagnosis During Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, some studies showed that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) might be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PC), whereas some other studies indicated that IBD was not associated with the increased risk of PC. In the present study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of IBD and PC risk.
METHODS: Web of Science and PubMed were systematically searched on for link of PC risk and IBD published from January 1976 to February 2019. The pooled multivariate odd ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained by the use of STATA 12.0 software.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated that IBD showed a 78% increase in PC risk (95% CI: 1.32-2.41). Sensitivity analyses showed no changes in the direction of effect after excluding any one study (supplementary figure 1). A significant heterogeneity was detected between different studies (Q test, P<0.001). Moreover, Begg's test, Egger's tests and funnel plots indicated no significant publication bias between included studies [Begg's test (P=0.371); Egger's test (p=0.100)].
CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis demonstrated that IBD was associated with an increased diagnosis of PC.

36495020,Meta-Analysis: The Efficacy Of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Of Anti-Tnf-Therapy In Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients on anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy results in improved rates of clinical and endoscopic remission, surgery, corticosteroid-free remission and hospitalisation.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE classic, PubMed, Cochrane central databases register of controlled trials and Cochrane Specialised Trials Register were searched between 01 Janurary 1946 and 08 April 2022. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective observational studies were included, comparing TDM to standard of care (SOC) or reactive vs proactive TDM. Results were reported as pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies, including 9 RCTs, were included. Compared to SOC, proactive TDM was associated with a significantly decreased risk of treatment failure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.85 p<0.01), and a non-significant decrease in need for surgery (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25-1.02) and hospitalisation (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40-1.00). Furthermore compared to SOC, Proactive TDM was associated with higher rates of endoscopic remission (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.93-1.53) and clinical remission (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97-1.18). Compared to reactive TDM, proactive TDM was associated with significant decreased risk of treatment failure (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 = 0.98, p = 0.04) and significant reduction in hospitalisation (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.54, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to SOC, proactive TDM was associated with significant benefit in reducing treatment failure. Compared to reactive TDM, proactive TDM led to a significant reduction in hospitalisation and treatment failure. More studies with larger RCTs and standardised assays are needed to substantiate these results and validate the cost-effectiveness of TDM.",Sethi S; Dias S; Kumar A; Blackwell J; Brookes MJ; Segal JP,2023,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,57,12,1362-1374,10.1111/apt.17313,"Sethi, S., Dias, S., Kumar, A., Blackwell, J., Brookes, M.

38206197,Efficacy And Safety Of Biologics In Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an immune-mediated, chronic cholestatic liver disease. Currently, liver transplantation is the only established life-saving treatment. Several studies have evaluated the effect of different biologic therapies on PSC with inconclusive findings. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of biologics in PSC and associated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase were searched up to July 31, 2023, for studies reporting the effects of biologics in patients with PSC-IBD. Effects of biologic therapy on alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, ulcerative colitis response score, and adverse events were calculated and expressed as standardized difference of means (SMD), proportions, and 95% CI using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Six studies, including 411 PSC-IBD patients who received biologics, were included. Biologic treatment was associated with no change in alkaline phosphatase (SMD: 0.1, 95% CI: -0.07 -0.17, p=0.43), but a small and statistically significant increase in total bilirubin (SMD: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.05-0.35, p<0.01). 31.2% (95% CI: 23.8-39.7) of patients with IBD achieved endoscopic response, and there was a significant improvement in ulcerative colitis response score (SMD: -0.6,95% CI: -0.88 to 0.36, p<0.01). Furthermore, 17.6% (95% CI: 13.0-23.5) of patients experienced adverse events severe enough to discontinue therapy, and 29.9% (95% CI: 25.2-34.8) had a loss of response to biologics.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with PSC-IBD with biologics (vedolizumab, infliximab, and adalimumab) was not associated with improvement of biochemical markers of cholestasis. Biologics are effective in treating the colitis associated with PSC. Vedolizumab was associated with worsening liver enzymes in contrast to other biologics, a finding that warrants further study.",Shah A; Jones MP; Callaghan G; Fairlie T; Ma X; Culver EL; Stuart K; De Cruz P; O'Beirne J; Tabibian JH; Dignass A; Canbay A; Gores GJ; Holtmann GJ,2024,Hepatology communications,8,1,,10.1097/HC9.0000000000000347,"Shah, A., Jones, M.

34913897,Survival Outcomes And Clinicopathological Features In Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the survival outcomes of IBD-associated and non-IBD-associated CRC.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Investigations comparing the prognosis in CRC patients with and without IBD have yielded conflicting results.
METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library were searched for studies evaluating the prognostic outcomes between CRC patients with IBD and those without IBD. Estimates of survival-related outcomes and clinicopathological features in IBD-CRC and non-IBD CRC were pooled through random-effects or fix-effects models. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021261513.
RESULTS: Of 12,768 records identified, twenty-five studies with 8034 IBD-CRC and 810,526 non-IBD CRC patients were included in the analysis. IBD-CRC patients have a significant worse overall survival (OS) with the hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.47] than those without IBD. Pooled estimates of cancer-specific survival demonstrated that IBD-CRC patients had a poorer cancer-specific survival than those without IBD with fixed-effect model (HR, 2.17; 95% CI: 1.68-2.78; P < 0.0001). Moreover, ulcerative colitis-associated CRC patients have favorable OS than Crohn's disease-associated CRC (HR 0.79,95% CI: 0.72-0.87). Compared to non-IBD-CRC, patients with IBD-associated CRC are characterized by an increased rate of poor differentiation (OR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.57-2.61), mucinous or signet ring cell carcinoma (OR 2.43, 95% CI: 1.34-4.42), synchronous tumors (OR 3.18, 95% CI: 2.26-4.47), right-sided CRC (OR 1.62, 95%CI: 1.05-2.05), male patients (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05-1.16), and a reduced rate of R0 resections (OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44-0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: IBD-CRC patients have a significant worse OS than patients with non-IBD CRC, which may be attributed to more aggressive histological characteristics and a lower rate of R0 resections at the primary tumor site. Optimized therapeutic standards and tailored follow-up strategies might improve the prognosis of IBD-CRC patients.",Lu C; Schardey J; Zhang T; Crispin A; Wirth U; Karcz KW; Bazhin AV; Andrassy J; Werner J; Kühn F,2022,Annals of surgery,276,5,e319-e330,10.1097/SLA.0000000000005339,"Lu, C., Schardey, J., Zhang, T., Crispin, A., Wirth, U., Karcz, K.

38926222,Efficacy And Safety Of Endoscopic Stricturotomy In Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Related Strictures: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Luminal strictures, common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD), are typically treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD). The newer endoscopic stricturotomy (ESt) approach shows promise, but data is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the effectiveness and safety of ESt in IBD-related strictures.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted until November 2023 for studies assessing ESt efficacy and safety in IBD. Primary outcomes were clinical and technical success, with secondary endpoints covering adverse events, subsequent stricture surgery, additional endoscopic treatments (ESt or EBD), medication escalation, disease-related emergency department visits, and hospitalization post-ESt. Technical success was defined as passing the scope through the stricture, and clinical success was defined as symptom improvement. Single-arm meta-analysis (CMA version 3) calculated the event rate per patient with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included, involving 640 ESt procedures on 287 IBD patients (169 CD, 118 ulcerative colitis). Of these, 53.3% were men, with a mean age of 43.3 ± 14.3 years and a mean stricture length of 1.68 ± 0.84 cm. The technical success rate was 96.4% (95% CI 92.5-98.3, p-value < 0.0001), and the clinical success rate was 62% (95% CI 52.2-70.9, p-value = 0.017, I2 = 34.670). The bleeding rate was 10.5% per patient, and the perforation rate was 3.5%. After an average follow-up of 0.95 ± 1.1 years, 16.4% required surgery for strictures post-ESt, while 44.2% needed additional endoscopic treatment. The medication escalation rate after ESt was 14.7%. The disease-related emergency department visit rate was 14.7%, and the disease-related hospitalization rate post-procedure was 21.3%.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that ESt is safe and effective for managing IBD-related strictures, making it a valuable addition to the armamentarium of endoscopists.

34678884,The Incidence Of Psoriasis Among Smokers And/Or Former Smokers Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Patients Treated With Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonist: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) refer to the classic drugs to treat moderate-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which have been proven to be effective to control IBD. However, the side effects exerted by IFX and ADA should be monitored in therapies, especially the paradoxical reaction of the skin system (e.g., psoriasis). Psoriasis is recognized as the most common skin lesion, capable of significantly affecting the quality of patients' life.
METHODS: This study searched literatures published in English language with the qualifications on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google, and Geenmedical databases. Over 2 co-authors assessed the quality of the articles and extracted the data independently. The data acquired were statistically analyzed with the statistical software of Revman and Stata.
RESULTS: The ADA Group achieved a higher incidence of psoriasis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.658, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.471-0.919]); Females achieved a higher incidence of psoriasis than males (OR = 1.941, 95%CI [1.326-2.843], P < .05); Smoking up-regulated the incidence of psoriasis (OR = 1.679, 95%CI [1.237-2.279], P < .05); The interval of medication was over 1 year, and the interval of medication applying IFX was longer than that of the ADA Group; most cases could be relieved by using local hormone, phototherapy, or systemic hormone therapy under the strategy of biological agents.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of reported in IBD exceeds those of other autoimmune diseases, and the ADA treatment for IBD is safer than IFX. Psoriasis is more common in females than in males.

39031224,Innovating Thiopurine Therapeutic Drug Monitoring: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis On Dna-Thioguanine Nucleotides (Dna-Tg) As An Inclusive Biomarker In Thiopurine Therapy.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Thioguanine (TG), azathioprine (AZA), and mercaptopurine (MP) are thiopurine prodrugs commonly used to treat diseases, such as leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) have been commonly used for monitoring treatment. High levels of 6-TGNs in red blood cells (RBCs) have been associated with leukopenia, the cutoff levels that predict this side effect remain uncertain. Thiopurines are metabolized and incorporated into leukocyte DNA. Measuring levels of DNA-incorporated thioguanine (DNA-TG) may be a more suitable method for predicting clinical response and toxicities such as leukopenia. Unfortunately, most methodologies to assay 6-TGNs are unable to identify the impact of NUDT15 variants, effecting mostly ethnic populations (e.g., Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese, and Hispanics). DNA-TG tackles this problem by directly measuring thioguanine in the DNA, which can be influenced by both TPMT and NUDT15 variants. While RBC 6-TGN concentrations have traditionally been used to optimize thiopurine therapy due to their ease and affordability of measurement, recent developments in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques have made measuring DNA-TG concentrations in lymphocytes accurate, reproducible, and affordable. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the current evidence of DNA-TG levels as marker for thiopurine therapy, especially with regards to NUDT15 variants.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the current evidence for DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy, including methods for measurement and the illustrative relationship between DNA-TG and various gene variants (such as TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, NT5C2, and MRP4). PubMed and Embase were systematically searched up to April 2024 for published studies, using the keyword ""DNA-TG"" with MeSH terms and synonyms. The electronic search strategy was augmented by a manual examination of references cited in articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed using R studio 4.1.3. to investigate the difference between the coefficients (Fisher's z-transformed correlation coefficient) of DNA-TG and 6-TGNs levels. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.4 to investigate the difference in DNA-TG levels between patients with or without leukopenia using randomized effect size model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa quality assessment scale.
RESULTS: In this systematic review, 21 studies were included that measured DNA-TG levels in white blood cells for either patients with ALL (n = 16) or IBD (n = 5). In our meta-analysis, the overall mean difference between patients with leukopenia (ALL + IBD) versus no leukopenia was 134.15 fmol TG/μg DNA [95% confidence interval (CI) (83.78-184.35), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 5.62, I2 of 47%]. There was a significant difference in DNA-TG levels for patients with IBD with and without leukopenia [161.76 fmol TG/μg DNA; 95% CI (126.23-197.29), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 0.20, I2 of 0%]. No significant difference was found in DNA-TG level between patients with ALL with or without leukopenia (57.71 fmol TG/μg DNA [95% CI (- 22.93 to 138.35), P < 0.80]). DNA-TG monitoring was found to be a promising method for predicting relapse rates in patients with ALL, and DNA-TG levels are likely a better predictor for leukopenia in patients with IBD than RBC 6-TGNs levels. DNA-TG levels have been shown to correlate with various gene variants (TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, and MRP4) in various studies, points to its potential as a more informative marker for guiding thiopurine therapy across diverse genetic backgrounds.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review strongly supports the further investigation of DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy. Its correlation with treatment outcomes, such as relapse-free survival in ALL and the risk of leukopenia in IBD, underscores its role in enhancing personalized treatment approaches. DNA-TG effectively identifies NUDT15 variants and predicts late leukopenia in patients with IBD, regardless of their NUDT15 variant status. The recommended threshold for late leukopenia prediction in patients with IBD with DNA-TG is suggested to be between 320 and 340 fmol/μg DNA. More clinical research on DNA-TG implementation is mandatory to improve patient care and to improve inclusivity in thiopurine treatment.",Bayoumy AB; Ansari AR; Mulder CJJ; Schmiegelow K; Florin T; De Boer NKH,2024,Clinical pharmacokinetics,63,8,1089-1109,10.1007/s40262-024-01393-0,"Bayoumy, A.

39926204,A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis: Adverse Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outcomes Following Acute Covid-19.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Respiratory viral infections have been implicated in the exacerbation of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To understand the impact of early SARS-CoV-2 variants on the risk of adverse IBD outcomes, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of high-quality studies.
METHODS: Cohort studies investigating adverse IBD outcomes (IBD flares, change in disease activity, change in medication, IBD-related hospitalization, and surgery) following COVID-19 were retrieved from MEDLINE and Embase. The Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies-of Exposure tool was used to assess risk of bias. Random effects model meta-analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for risk of adverse outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed to estimate risk of outcomes for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Metaregression was performed for sex and duration of follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 3119 identified studies, 5 were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 34,977 IBD patients with COVID-19 and 53,270 IBD patients without recorded COVID-19 infection were identified. Two of the studies showed a high risk of bias. The random effects model did not show a statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse IBD outcomes following COVID infection (HR:1.05 [0.75-1.46]). There was no significant difference in adverse outcomes between Crohn's disease (HR: 0.91 [0.82-1.02]) and ulcerative colitis patients (HR: 0.83 [0.76-0.90]). Neither the proportion of male participants nor the mean duration of follow-up were found to be significant predictors of effect size.

35355306,"Effectiveness And Safety Of Sars-Cov-2 Vaccine In Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis And Meta-Regression.","INTRODUCTION: There are concerns regarding the effectiveness and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively summarises the available literature regarding the safety and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in IBD.
METHODS: Three independent reviewers performed a comprehensive review of all original articles describing the response of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with IBD. Primary outcomes were (1) pooled seroconversion rate SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients (2) comparison of breakthrough COVID-19 infection rate SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients with control cohort and (3) pooled adverse event rate of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All outcomes were evaluated for one and two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Meta-regression was performed. Probability of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and with Egger's test.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies yielded a pooled seroconversion rate of 73.7% and 96.8% in IBD patients after one and two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine respectively. Sub-group analysis revealed non-statistically significant differences between different immunosuppressive regimens for seroconversion. Meta-regression revealed that the vaccine type and study location independently influenced seroconversion rates. There was no statistically significant difference in breakthrough infection in IBD patients as compared to control after vaccination.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is safe and effective in IBD patients.",Bhurwal A; Mutneja H; Bansal V; Goel A; Arora S; Attar B; Minacapelli CD; Kochhar G; Chen LA; Brant S; Seril D,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,10,1244-1264,10.1111/apt.16913,"Bhurwal, A., Mutneja, H., Bansal, V., Goel, A., Arora, S., Attar, B., Minacapelli, C.
