34376515,efficacy of a low fodmap diet in irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"objective: a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (fodmap) is recommended for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), if general lifestyle and dietary advice fails. however, although the impact of a low fodmap diet on individual ibs symptoms has been examined in some randomised controlled trials (rcts), there has been no recent systematic assessment, and individual trials have studied numerous alternative or control interventions, meaning the best comparator is unclear. we performed a network meta-analysis addressing these uncertainties.
design: we searched the medical literature through to 2 april 2021 to identify rcts of a low fodmap diet in ibs. efficacy was judged using dichotomous assessment of improvement in global ibs symptoms or improvement in individual ibs symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy reported as pooled relative risks (rrs) with 95% cis, and interventions ranked according to their p-score.
results: we identified 13 eligible rcts (944 patients). based on failure to achieve an improvement in global ibs symptoms, a low fodmap diet ranked first vs habitual diet (rr of symptoms not improving=0.67; 95% ci 0.48 to 0.91, p-score=0.99), and was superior to all other interventions. low fodmap diet ranked first for abdominal pain severity, abdominal bloating or distension severity and bowel habit, although for the latter it was not superior to any other intervention. a low fodmap diet was superior to british dietetic association (bda)/national institute for health and care excellence (nice) dietary advice for abdominal bloating or distension (rr=0.72; 95% ci 0.55 to 0.94). bda/nice dietary advice was not superior to any other intervention in any analysis.
conclusion: in a network analysis, low fodmap diet ranked first for all endpoints studied. however, most trials were based in secondary or tertiary care and did not study effects of fodmap reintroduction and personalisation on symptoms.",Black CJ; Staudacher HM; Ford AC,2022,Gut,71,6,1117-1126,10.1136/gutjnl-2021-325214,"Black, C.

35942669,systematic review and meta-analysis: efficacy of peppermint oil in irritable bowel syndrome.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, with a complex pathophysiology. antispasmodics are prescribed as first-line therapy because of their action on gut dysmotility. in this regard, peppermint oil also has antispasmodic properties.
aim: to update our previous meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of peppermint oil, particularly as recent studies have cast doubt on its role in the treatment of ibs methods: we searched the medical literature up to 2nd april 2022 to identify randomised controlled trials (rcts) of peppermint oil in ibs. efficacy and safety were judged using dichotomous assessments of effect on global ibs symptoms or abdominal pain, and occurrence of any adverse event or of gastro-oesophageal reflux. data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (rrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis).
results: we identified 10 eligible rcts (1030 patients). peppermint oil was more efficacious than placebo for global ibs symptoms (rr of not improving = 0.65; 95% ci 0.43-0.98, number needed to treat [nnt] = 4; 95% ci 2.5-71), and abdominal pain (rr of abdominal pain not improving = 0.76; 95% ci 0.62-0.93, nnt = 7; 95% ci 4-24). adverse event rates were significantly higher with peppermint oil (rr of any adverse event = 1.57; 95% ci 1.04-2.37).

33585949,efficacy of a low-fodmap diet in adult irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"purpose: this review provides an updated overview of observational and intervention studies investigating the effect of a low-fodmap (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols) diet (lfd) on gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms, quality of life (qol), nutritional adequacy, and gut microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients.
methods: we systematically searched available literature until october 2020 for studies that investigated the effect of lfds on gi symptoms, qol, nutritional adequacy, and the gut microbiome in ibs patients. the data were represented as standardized mean differences (smd) for ibs severity, and as mean differences (md) for ibs-qol. meta-analyses were performed for the quantitative analyses using random effects models with inverse variance weighing.
results: twelve papers (nine parallel trials, three crossover studies) were included for the meta-analysis. the lfd reduced ibs severity by a moderate-to-large extent as compared to a control diet (smd - 0.66, 95% ci - 0.88, - 0.44, i2 = 54%). when analyzing only studies that used the validated ibs-sss questionnaire, a mean reduction of 45 points (95% ci - 77, - 14; i2 = 89%) was observed. subgroup analyses on adherence, age, intervention duration, ibs subtype, outcome measure, and risk of bias revealed no significantly different results. the lfd also increased ibs-qol scores, when compared with a control diet (md 4.93; 95% ci 1.77, 8.08; i2 = 42%).
conclusions: the low-fodmap diet reduces gi symptoms and improves quality of life in ibs subjects as compared to control diets. future work is required to obtain definitive answers regarding potential long-term effects of such diets on nutritional adequacy and the gut microbiome.

32276950,efficacy of psychological therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"objectives: national guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) recommend that psychological therapies should be considered, but their relative efficacy is unknown, because there have been few head-to-head trials. we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to try to resolve this uncertainty.
design: we searched the medical literature through january 2020 for randomised controlled trials (rcts) assessing efficacy of psychological therapies for adults with ibs, compared with each other, or a control intervention. trials reported a dichotomous assessment of symptom status after completion of therapy. we pooled data using a random effects model. efficacy was reported as a pooled relative risk (rr) of remaining symptomatic, with a 95% ci to summarise efficacy of each comparison tested, and ranked by therapy according to p score.
results: we identified 41 eligible rcts, containing 4072 participants. after completion of therapy, the psychological interventions with the largest numbers of trials, and patients recruited, demonstrating efficacy included self-administered or minimal contact cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) (rr 0.61; 95% ci 0.45 to 0.83, p score 0.66), face-to-face cbt (rr 0.62; 95% ci 0.48 to 0.80, p score 0.65) and gut-directed hypnotherapy (rr 0.67; 95% ci 0.49 to 0.91, p score 0.57). after completion of therapy, among trials recruiting only patients with refractory symptoms, group cbt and gut-directed hypnotherapy were more efficacious than either education and/or support or routine care, and cbt via the telephone, contingency management, cbt via the internet and dynamic psychotherapy were all superior to routine care. risk of bias of trials was high, with evidence of funnel plot asymmetry; the efficacy of psychological therapies is therefore likely to have been overestimated.
conclusions: several psychological therapies are efficacious for ibs, although none were superior to another. cbt-based interventions and gut-directed hypnotherapy had the largest evidence base and were the most efficacious long term.

methods: a systematic literature search was conducted according to the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (moose) guidelines. risk of bias was assessed using the quality in prognostic studies tool. random-effects models were created separately for odds and hazard ratios, different study designs, and univariable or multivariable data. the evidence for all prognostic factors was categorized as ""weak"", ""moderate"", or ""strong"", based on estimate of effect sizes, heterogeneity, and risk of bias.
results: a total of 164 studies were included, allowing pooled analysis of 31 potential prognostic factors. in the univariable analysis, the evidence for extensive disease was classified as strong while evidence for low-grade dysplasia, strictures, primary sclerosing cholangitis, post-inflammatory polyps, family history of crc, and ulcerative colitis versus crohn's disease was considered moderate. evidence for any dysplasia, colon segment resection, aneuploidy, male sex, and age was classified as weak. in addition, histologic inflammation was identified as a risk factor in multivariable analysis (weak evidence). the evidence for the protective factors colonoscopic surveillance, 5-aminosalicylic acid, thiopurines, and smoking was moderate in univariable analysis. multivariable analysis provided weak evidence for statin use.

methods: the search was performed in pubmed, web of science and the cochrane library from inception to april 2020. qualified randomized controlled trials were included. ibd's remission rate, disease activity index and recurrence rate were extracted and analyzed. changes in the gut microbiota of patients with ibd are comprehensively described.
results: thirty-eight articles were included. probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can induce/maintain ibd's remission and reduce ulcerative colitis (uc) disease activity index (rr = 1.13, 95% ci 1.02, 1.26, p < 0.05; smd = 1.00, 95% ci 0.27, 1.73, p < 0.05). in subgroup analyses of ibd remission rate and uc disease activity index, we obtained some statistically significant results in some subgroup (p < 0.05). to some extent, probiotic supplements can increase the number of beneficial bacteria (especially bifidobacteria) in the intestinal tract of patients with ibd.
conclusions: our results support the treatment of ibd (especially uc) with pro/pre/synbiotics, and synbiotics are more effective. probiotic supplements that are based on lactobacillus and bifidobacterium or more than one strain are more likely to be beneficial for ibd remission. the dose of 1010-1012 cfu/day may be a reference range for using probiotics to relieve ibd.",Zhang XF; Guan XX; Tang YJ; Sun JF; Wang XK; Wang WD; Fan JM,2021,European journal of nutrition,60,5,2855-2875,10.1007/s00394-021-02503-5,"Zhang, X.

design: we investigated the relation between 173 dietary factors and the microbiome of 1425 individuals spanning four cohorts: crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and the general population. shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to profile gut microbial composition and function. dietary intake was assessed through food frequency questionnaires. we performed unsupervised clustering to identify dietary patterns and microbial clusters. associations between diet and microbial features were explored per cohort, followed by a meta-analysis and heterogeneity estimation.
results: we identified 38 associations between dietary patterns and microbial clusters. moreover, 61 individual foods and nutrients were associated with 61 species and 249 metabolic pathways in the meta-analysis across healthy individuals and patients with ibs, crohn's disease and uc (false discovery rate<0.05). processed foods and animal-derived foods were consistently associated with higher abundances of firmicutes, ruminococcus species of the blautia genus and endotoxin synthesis pathways. the opposite was found for plant foods and fish, which were positively associated with short-chain fatty acid-producing commensals and pathways of nutrient metabolism.
conclusion: we identified dietary patterns that consistently correlate with groups of bacteria with shared functional roles in both, health and disease. moreover, specific foods and nutrients were associated with species known to infer mucosal protection and anti-inflammatory effects. we propose microbial mechanisms through which the diet affects inflammatory responses in the gut as a rationale for future intervention studies.",Bolte LA; Vich Vila A; Imhann F; Collij V; Gacesa R; Peters V; Wijmenga C; Kurilshikov A; Campmans-Kuijpers MJE; Fu J; Dijkstra G; Zhernakova A; Weersma RK,2021,Gut,70,7,1287-1298,10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322670,"Bolte, L.

methods: this was a systematic review and individual-patient data meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of biologics approved for ibd at study inception (october 2015), using vivli data-sharing platform. the primary outcome was the proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission in patients with short-duration (≤18 months) vs long-duration disease (>18 months) analyzed separately for cd and ulcerative colitis (uc). we used meta-regression to examine the impact of patients' characteristics on the primary outcome.
results: we included 25 trials, testing infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, natalizumab, or vedolizumab (6168 patients with cd and 3227 patients with uc). in cd, remission induction rates were higher in pooled placebo and patients in active arms with short-duration disease of ≤18 months (41.4% [244 of 589]) compared with disease duration of >18 months (29.8% [852 of 2857], meta-analytically estimated odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.64). the primary outcome, proportional biologic/placebo treatment effect on induction of remission, was not different in short-duration disease of ≤18 months (n = 589, odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.15) compared with longer disease duration (n = 2857, odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.72). in uc trials, both the proportional biologic/placebo remission-induction effect and the pooled biologic-placebo effect were stable, regardless of disease duration. primary outcome results remained unchanged when tested using alternative temporal cutoffs and when modeled for individual patient's covariates, including prior anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure.

design: we included observational studies recruiting ≥50 adults and reporting prevalence of ibs or fd after acute gastroenteritis with ≥3-month follow-up. a random effects model was used to estimate prevalence and ors with 95% cis.
results: in total, 47 studies (28 170 subjects) were eligible. overall prevalence of pi-ibs and pi-fd were 14.5% and 12.7%, respectively. ibs persisted in 39.8% of subjects in the long-term (>5 years follow-up) after diagnosis. individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis had a significantly higher odds of ibs (or 4.3) and fd (or 3.0) than non-exposed controls. pi-ibs was most associated with parasites (prevalence 30.1%), but in only two studies, followed by bacteria (18.3%) and viruses (10.7%). in available studies, campylobacter was associated with the highest pi-ibs prevalence (20.7%) whereas proteobacteria and sars-cov-2 yielded the highest odds for pi-ibs (both or 5.4). prevalence of pi-fd was 10.0% for sars-cov-2 and 13.6% for bacteria (enterobacteriaceae 19.4%).
conclusion: in a large systematic review and meta-analysis, 14.5% of individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis developed pi-ibs and 12.7% pi-fd, with greater than fourfold increased odds for ibs and threefold for fd. proinflammatory microbes, including proteobacteria and subcategories, and sars-cov-2, may be associated with the development of pi-ibs and pi-fd.",Porcari S; Ingrosso MR; Maida M; Eusebi LH; Black C; Gasbarrini A; Cammarota G; Ford AC; Ianiro G,2024,Gut,73,9,1431-1440,10.1136/gutjnl-2023-331835,"Porcari, S., Ingrosso, M.

37202602,nightshade vegetables: a dietary trigger for worsening inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome?,"the solanaceae family of plants, commonly known as nightshade vegetables or nightshades, contains a diverse range of crops of over 2000 members with significant culinary, economic, and cultural importance. familiar edible nightshades include tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and white potatoes. many pharmacologically active compounds used in traditional medicine, including atropine and hyoscyamine, are derived from nightshades. in addition to these beneficial pharmacologic agents, nightshade-derived glycoalkaloid compounds, a key defense mechanism against predation, have been shown to disrupt intestinal epithelium and to potentially activate mast cells in the gut mucosa, leading to adverse symptoms in humans. there is a new appreciation that mast cell activation is an allergic inflammatory mechanism contributing both to pain in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and to gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). given their ubiquity in western diets and their shared glycoalkaloid active compounds, edible nightshades are attracting new interest as a potential trigger for worsening gut symptoms in functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders. here, we review the limited existing literature on the adverse effects of nightshade consumption, including the effects of nightshade-derived glycoalkaloids on ibd gut inflammation, and the under-recognized contribution of nightshades to food allergies and allergic cross-reactivity. we then highlight new evidence on the contributions of mast cell activation to gi disorder pathogenesis, including potential linkages between nightshade antigens, intestinal mast cells, and gi dysfunction in ibs and ibd.",Kuang R; Levinthal DJ; Ghaffari AA; Del Aguila de Rivers CR; Tansel A; Binion DG,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,7,2853-2860,10.1007/s10620-023-07955-9,"Kuang, R., Levinthal, D.

39064809,correlation between alzheimer's disease and gastrointestinal tract disorders.,"alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. the pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes deposition of amyloid-β in the central nervous system, presence of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and a decreased amount of synapses. it remains uncertain what causes the progression of the disease. nowadays, it is suggested that the brain is connected to the gastrointestinal tract, especially the enteric nervous system and gut microbiome. studies have found a positive association between ad and gastrointestinal diseases such as periodontitis, helicobacter pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease and microbiome disorders. h. pylori and its metabolites can enter the cns via the oropharyngeal olfactory pathway and may predispose to the onset and progression of ad. periodontitis may cause systemic inflammation of low severity with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils. moreover, lipopolysaccharide from oral bacteria accompanies beta-amyloid in plaques that form in the brain. increased intestinal permeability in ibs leads to neuronal inflammation from transference. chronic inflammation may lead to beta-amyloid plaque formation in the intestinal tract that spreads to the brain via the vagus nerve. the microbiome plays an important role in many bodily functions, such as nutrient absorption and vitamin production, but it is also an important factor in the development of many diseases, including alzheimer's disease. both the quantity and diversity of the microbiome change significantly in patients with ad and even in people in the preclinical stage of the disease, when symptoms are not yet present. the microbiome influences the functioning of the central nervous system through, among other things, the microbiota-gut-brain axis. given the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ad, antibiotic therapy, probiotics and prebiotics, and faecal transplantation are being considered as possible therapeutic options.",Kuźniar J; Kozubek P; Czaja M; Leszek J,2024,Nutrients,16,14,,10.3390/nu16142366,"Kuźniar, J., Kozubek, P., Czaja, M., & Leszek, J.

38173154,symptomatic response to antibiotics in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background/aims: we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the symptomatic response rate to antibiotics in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo). similarly, we performed a meta-analysis on the symptomatic response to antibiotics in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients with and without sibo.
methods: medline, embase, web of science, and cochrane databases were searched from inception to march 2021. randomized controlled trials and prospective studies reporting dichotomous outcomes were included.
results: there were 6 studies included in the first meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of antibiotics to placebo or no antibiotic. this included 196 patients, of whom 101 received antibiotics and 95 received placebo or no antibiotics. significantly more patients improved with antibiotics (relative risk [95% ci] = 2.46 [1.33-4.55], p = 0.004). there were 4 studies included in the analysis comparing symptomatic response rates in ibs patients with or without sibo with 266 ibs patients, of whom 172 had sibo and 94 did not. the pooled response rate for symptomatic response was 51.2% in the sibo group vs 23.4% in the no sibo group, respectively. significantly more ibs patients with sibo responded to antibiotics compared to those without sibo (relative risk [95% ci] = 2.07 [1.40-3.08], p = 0.0003).
conclusions: antibiotics appear to be efficacious in treating sibo, although small sample sizes and poor data quality limit this interpretation. symptomatic response rates also appear to be higher in ibs patients with sibo. this may be the first example of precision medicine in ibs as opposed to our current empiric treatment approach. large-multicenter studies are needed to verify the results.",Takakura W; Rezaie A; Chey WD; Wang J; Pimentel M,2024,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,30,1,7-16,10.5056/jnm22187,"Takakura, W., Rezaie, A., Chey, W.

35766861,physical activity for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.,"background: current recommendations for people with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) to partake in physical activity are based on low-level evidence, do not incorporate evidence from all available randomised controlled trials (rcts) and provide little information regarding potential adverse effects.
objectives: to assess the benefits and harms of physical activity interventions in adults diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and to explore possible effect moderators including type, setting and nature of physical activity interventions.
search methods: we searched nine electronic databases including central, medline and embase to 5 november 2021. we handsearched reference lists and sought unpublished studies through trial registries.
selection criteria: we included rcts involving adults (aged 18 years or older) diagnosed with ibs and conducted in any setting comparing a physical activity intervention with no intervention, usual care or wait-list control group or another physical activity intervention group and assessing a validated measure of symptoms, quality of life or bowel movement.
data collection and analysis: at least two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted study data, and performed risk of bias and grade assessments to assess the certainty of evidence. we pooled studies that evaluated similar outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and synthesised data from other studies narratively.
main results: we included 11 rcts with data for 622 participants. most (10/11) were set in high- or middle- to high-income countries, with five involving supervised physical activity, three unsupervised activity and three a mix of supervised and unsupervised activity. no trial was at low risk of bias. four trials specified a minimally important difference for at least one assessed outcome measure. data for 10 trials were obtained from published journal articles, with data for one obtained from an unpublished masters degree thesis. irritable bowel syndrome symptoms six rcts assessed the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention compared with usual care on global symptoms of ibs. meta-analysis of five studies showed an observed improvement in reported symptoms following physical activity (standardised mean difference (smd) -0.93, 95% confidence interval (ci) -1.44 to -0.42; 185 participants). we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as very low due to unclear and high risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision from sparse data. this means physical activity may improve ibs symptoms but the evidence is very uncertain. the results of the remaining study supported the meta-analysis but were at unclear risk of bias and sample size was small. two studies assessed the effectiveness of a yoga intervention compared with a walking intervention on global ibs symptoms. meta-analysis of these two studies found no conclusive evidence of an effect of yoga compared with walking on ibs symptoms (smd -1.16, 95% ci -3.93 to 1.62; 124 participants). we rated the certainty of evidence as very low, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga interventions compared with walking interventions on ibs symptoms. two studies assessed the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention (yoga) compared with medication. one reported no observed difference in global ibs symptoms, though cis were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the observed estimates and risk of bias was high (md -1.20, 95% ci -2.65 to 0.25; 21 participants). we excluded ibs symptom data for the remaining study as it used a non-validated method. one study compared a yoga intervention with a dietary intervention and reported an observed improvement in symptoms with both interventions but neither intervention was superior to the other. quality of life five rcts assessed the impact of physical activity on self-reported quality of life compared with usual care. meta-analysis of data from four studies found no improvement in quality of life following a physical activity intervention (smd 1.17, 95% ci -0.30 to 2.64; 134 participants; very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision). we rated the certainty of evidence as very low, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity interventions on quality-of-life outcomes in people with ibs. one study assessed the impact on quality of life of a yoga intervention compared with walking and observed an improvement in the yoga group (md 53.45, 95% ci 38.85 to 68.05; 97 participants ). one study reported no observed difference in quality of life between a yoga and a dietary intervention. abdominal pain two trials assessed the impact of physical activity compared with usual care on reported abdominal pain. meta-analysis found no improvement in abdominal pain with physical activity compared with usual care (smd 0.01, 95% ci -0.48 to 0.50; 64 participants). we rated the certainty of the evidence as very low due to risk of bias and imprecision, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity interventions on abdominal pain in people with ibs. one study assessing the impact of a yoga intervention compared with walking advice reported no observed differences between groups on abdominal pain. one study comparing a yoga intervention with a dietary intervention found neither intervention had a more beneficial impact than the other and both interventions did not conclusively reduce abdominal pain. there was insufficient evidence to adequately assess adverse effects associated with physical activity due to a lack of reporting in trials. one study reported a musculoskeletal injury in a yoga intervention group but this did not result in withdrawal from the study.
authors' conclusions: findings from a small body of evidence suggest that physical activity comprising of yoga, treadmill exercise or support to increase physical activity may improve symptoms but not quality of life or abdominal pain in people diagnosed with ibs but we have little confidence in these conclusions due to the very low certainty of evidence. the numbers of reported adverse events were low and the certainty of these findings was very low for all comparisons, so no conclusions can be drawn. discussions with patients considering physical activity as part of symptom management should address the uncertainty in the evidence to ensure fully informed decisions. if deemed sufficiently important to patients and healthcare providers, higher quality research is needed to enable more certain conclusions.",Nunan D; Cai T; Gardener AD; Ordóñez-Mena JM; Roberts NW; Thomas ET; Mahtani KR,2022,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,6,6,CD011497,10.1002/14651858.CD011497.pub2,"Nunan, D., Cai, T., Gardener, A.

objective: to systematically assess the efficacy of lfd in ibd patients with fgss.
methods: six databases were searched from inception to 1 january 2022. data were synthesized as the relative risk of symptoms improvement and normal stool consistency, mean difference of bristol stool form scale (bsfs), short ibd questionnaire (sibdq), ibs quality of life (ibs-qol), harvey-bradshaw index (hbi), mayo score, and fecal calprotectin (fc). risk of bias was assessed based on study types. a funnel plot and egger's test were used to analyze publication bias.
results: this review screened and included nine eligible studies, including four randomized controlled trials (rcts) and five before-after studies, involving a total of 446 participants (351 patients with lfd vs. 95 controls). lfd alleviated overall fgss (rr: 0.47, 95% ci: 0.33-0.66, p = 0.0000) and obtained higher sibdq scores (md = 11.24, 95% ci 6.61 to 15.87, p = 0.0000) and lower hbi score of crohn's disease (md = -1.09, 95% ci -1.77 to -0.42, p = 0.002). however, there were no statistically significant differences in normal stool consistency, bsfs, ibs-qol, mayo score of ulcerative colitis, and fc. no publication bias was found.

31859183,"efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, and gut-brain neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","background: although novel therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) continue to be developed, many doctors rely on more established, traditional therapies as first-line or second-line treatment options. these therapies include soluble fibre (eg, ispaghula husk), antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators (including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or α-2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands). however, the relative efficacy of traditional treatments in patients with ibs is unclear because there have been few head-to-head randomised controlled trials (rcts). we aimed to compare and rank the efficacy of traditional therapies in patients with ibs to help inform clinical decisions.
methods: for this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched medline, embase, embase classic, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials from inception to week 2 of august 2019; clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished trials or supplementary data published up to aug 18, 2019; and gastroenterology conference proceedings for study abstracts published between 2001 and aug 18, 2019. we included rcts that compared any of these treatments with each other (head-to-head trials) or with placebo, in which the efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, or gut-brain neuromodulators was assessed in adults (aged at least 18 years) with ibs of any subtype after 4-12 weeks of treatment. only rcts reporting a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, in terms of either improvement in global ibs symptoms or improvement in abdominal pain, were included. the efficacy and safety of all treatments were reported as a pooled relative risk (rr) with 95% cis to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and treatments were ranked according to their p-score.
findings: our search identified 5863 references, of which 81 were screened for eligibility. 51 rcts with data from 4644 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis, but only 13 of these trials were at low risk of bias. based on an endpoint of failure to achieve improvement in global ibs symptoms at 4-12 weeks, peppermint oil capsules were ranked first for efficacy (rr 0·63, 95% ci 0·48-0·83, p-score 0·84) and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked second (0·66, 0·53-0·83, p-score 0·77). for failure to achieve an improvement in global ibs symptoms at 4-12 weeks, there were no significant differences between active treatments after direct or indirect comparisons. for failure to achieve improvement in abdominal pain at 4-12 weeks, tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy (0·53, 0·34-0·83, p-score 0·87); however, this result was based on data from only four rcts involving 92 patients. for failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal pain, none of the active treatments showed superior efficacy upon indirect comparison. tricyclic antidepressants were more likely than placebo to lead to adverse events (1·59, 1·26-2·06, p-score 0·16).
interpretation: in this network meta-analysis of rcts of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators for ibs, few of which were judged as being at a low risk of bias, peppermint oil was ranked first for efficacy when global symptoms were used as the outcome measure, and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy when abdominal pain was used as the outcome measure. however, because of the lack of methodological rigour of some rcts analysed in our study, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty around these findings. in addition, because treatment duration in most included trials was 4-12 weeks, the long-term relative efficacy of these treatments is unknown.

methods: major databases, trial registries, dissertations, and journals were systematically searched for studies on the lfd in adults with ibs. meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model with standardized mean differences (smd) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). outcomes of interest were all patient-reported: stool consistency, stool frequency, abdominal pain, overall symptoms, adequate symptom relief, ibs-specific qol and adherence to the lfd.
results: eleven efficacy and 19 real-world studies were reviewed. the meta-analysis results for abdominal pain (smd 0.35, 95% ci 0.16 to 0.54) and qol (smd 0.23, 95% ci -0.05 to 0.50) showed the lfd was beneficial in efficacy studies with no statistically significant results for stool frequency (smd 0.71, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.07). real-world studies found improvements in abdominal pain and qol. due to heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was done for stool consistency and overall symptoms. in these outcomes, results were mostly supportive of the lfd, but they were not always statistically significant.
conclusions: the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest the lfd improves outcomes compared to a control diet (efficacy studies) or baseline data (real-world studies). because of diverse study designs and heterogeneity of results, a clear superiority of the lfd over control diets could not be concluded. there are no indications of an efficacy-effectiveness gap for the lfd in adults with ibs.",Jent S; Bez NS; Haddad J; Catalano L; Egger KS; Raia M; Tedde GS; Rogler G,2024,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",43,6,1551-1562,10.1016/j.clnu.2024.05.014,"Jent, S., Bez, N.

37375612,efficacy of different dietary patterns in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders in children and adolescents: a systematic review of intervention studies.,"functional gastrointestinal disorders (fgids) are common in children and adolescents. in recent years, interest in the role of diet in the treatment of fgids has increased. currently, interest focuses on the low-fodmap diet (lfd), the fructose- or lactose-restricted diet (frd or lrd), the gluten-free diet (gfd), and the mediterranean diet (md). in this review, we focus on the role of these dietary patterns in the fgids most commonly diagnosed in clinical practice, namely irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), functional abdominal pain (fap), functional dyspepsia (fd), and functional constipation (fc). fifteen clinical trials were systematically reviewed (both rcts and single-arm clinical trials). we demonstrated the lack of high-quality intervention trials. based on current evidence, low-fodmap diet, lrd, frd, and gfd have no place in daily clinical practice for the management of children and adolescents with fgids. nevertheless, some patients with ibs or rap may experience some benefit from the use of a low-fodmap diet or frd/lrd. limited data suggest that md may be promising in the management of fgids, especially in ibs patients, but more data are required to investigate the mechanisms of its protective effects.",Katsagoni CN; Karagianni VM; Papadopoulou A,2023,Nutrients,15,12,,10.3390/nu15122708,"Katsagoni, C.

33917379,gastroprotective effects of polyphenols against various gastro-intestinal disorders: a mini-review with special focus on clinical evidence.,"polyphenols are classified as an organic chemical with phenolic units that display an array of biological functions. however, polyphenols have very low bioavailability and stability, which make polyphenols a less bioactive compound. many researchers have indicated that several factors might affect the efficiency and the metabolism (biotransformation) of various polyphenols, which include the gut microbiota, structure, and physical properties as well as its interactions with other dietary nutrients (macromolecules). hence, this mini-review covers the two-way interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota (interplay) and how polyphenols are metabolized (biotransformation) to produce various polyphenolic metabolites. moreover, the protective effects of numerous polyphenols and their metabolites against various gastrointestinal disorders/diseases including gastritis, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) like ulcerative colitis (uc), crohn's disease (cd), and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) like celiac disease (ced) are discussed. for this review, the authors chose only a few popular polyphenols (green tea polyphenol, curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin), and a discussion of their proposed mechanism underpinning the gastroprotection was elaborated with a special focus on clinical evidence. overall, this contribution would help the general population and science community to identify a potent polyphenol with strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory properties to combat various gut-related diseases or disorders (complementary therapy) along with modified lifestyle pattern and standard gastroprotective drugs. however, the data from clinical trials are much limited and hence many large-scale clinical trials should be performed (with different form/metabolites and dose) to confirm the gastroprotective activity of the above-mentioned polyphenols and their metabolites before recommendation.",Chiu HF; Venkatakrishnan K; Golovinskaia O; Wang CK,2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",26,7,,10.3390/molecules26072090,"Chiu, H.

40258374,efficacy of dietary interventions in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"background: patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) are often interested in dietary interventions as a means of managing their symptoms. however, the relative efficacy of available diets for the management of ibs is unclear. we aimed to examine the relative efficacy of various dietary interventions in ibs.
methods: for this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched medline, embase, embase classic, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials from database inception to feb 7, 2025, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing an active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food in ibs with either a control intervention, such as a habitual diet, sham diet, a high fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (fodmap) diet, or alternative miscellaneous dietary advice, or any other active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food. we assessed efficacy using dichotomous assessments of improvement in global ibs symptoms or improvement in individual ibs symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. we pooled data using a random-effects model, with the efficacy of each intervention reported as pooled relative risks (rrs) with 95% cis. we ranked interventions according to their p-score, which measures the mean extent of certainty that one intervention is better than another, averaged over all competing interventions.
findings: we identified 28 eligible randomised controlled trials (comprising 2338 patients) of 11 different dietary interventions compared with four control interventions, of which six (low fodmap diet, british dietetic association/national institute for health and care excellence [bda/nice] diet, lactose-reduced diet, starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet, a personalised diet, and a mediterranean diet) were studied in more than one trial. for global ibs symptoms, assessed in 28 randomised controlled trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked first (rr of global ibs symptoms not improving 0·41 [95% ci 0·26-0·67]; p-score 0·84; two trials), a low fodmap diet ranked fourth (0·51 [0·37-0·70]; p-score 0·71; 24 trials), and a bda/nice diet ranked tenth (0·62 [0·43-0·90]; p-score 0·44; eight trials), versus a habitual diet. for abdominal pain, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised controlled trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked second (rr of abdominal pain not improving 0·54 [95% ci 0·33-0·90]; p-score 0·73; two trials), and a low fodmap diet ranked fifth (0·61 [0·42-0·89]; p-score 0·64; 23 trials), versus a habitual diet. for abdominal bloating or distension, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised trial, only a low fodmap diet (rr of abdominal bloating or distension not improving 0·55 [95% ci 0·37-0·80]; p-score 0·64; 23 trials) was superior to a habitual diet and ranked fourth. for bowel habit, assessed in 23 randomised trials, none of the dietary interventions was superior to any of the control interventions, but a low fodmap diet was superior to a bda/nice diet (rr of bowel habit not improving 0·79 [95% ci 0·63-0·99]). all comparisons across the network were rated as low or very low confidence, except for direct comparisons between a low fodmap diet or a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet and habitual diet, both of which were rated as moderate confidence.
interpretation: in terms of dietary interventions for ibs, the most evidence exists for a low fodmap diet, but other promising therapies are emerging and should be the subject of further study.

38777133,effect of brain-gut behavioral treatments on abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"background & aims: some brain-gut behavioral treatments (bgbts) are beneficial for global symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). united states management guidelines suggest their use in patients with persistent abdominal pain, but their specific effect on this symptom has not been assessed systematically.
methods: we searched the literature through december 16, 2023, for randomized controlled trials (rcts) assessing efficacy of bgbts for adults with ibs, compared with each other or a control intervention. trials provided an assessment of abdominal pain resolution or improvement at treatment completion. we extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming dropouts to be treatment failures and reporting pooled relative risks (rrs) of abdominal pain not improving with 95% confidence intervals (cis), ranking therapies according to the p score.
results: we identified 42 eligible randomized controlled trials comprising 5220 participants. after treatment completion, the bgbts with the largest numbers of trials and patients recruited demonstrating efficacy for abdominal pain, specifically, included self-guided/minimal contact cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) (rr, 0.71; 95% ci, 0.54-0.95; p score, 0.58), face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy (rr, 0.72; 95% ci, 0.54-0.97; p score, 0.56), and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy (rr, 0.77; 95% ci, 0.61-0.96; p score, 0.49). among trials recruiting only patients with refractory global ibs symptoms, group cbt was more efficacious than routine care for abdominal pain, but no other significant differences were detected. no trials were low risk of bias across all domains, and there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry.

methods: we performed a systematic electronic search on pubmed, embase, scopus, and cochrane library, including observational or interventional studies evaluating serum or plasma adiponectin levels in ibd patients in humans. the primary summary outcome was the mean difference (md) in serum or plasma adiponectin levels between ibd patients versus controls. subgroup analyses were conducted involving adiponectin levels in cd and uc compared to controls, as well as cd compared to uc.
results: a total of 20 studies were included in our qualitative synthesis and 14 studies in our quantitative synthesis, with a total population sample of 2,085 subjects. no significant md in serum adiponectin levels was observed between ibd patients versus controls {-1.331 (95% confidence interval [ci]: -3.135-0.472)}, uc patients versus controls (-0.213 [95% ci: -1.898-1.472]), and cd patients versus controls (-0.851 [95% ci: -2.263-0.561]). nevertheless, a significant md was found between uc patients versus cd patients (0.859 [95% ci: 0.097-1.622]).

39835671,an evidence-based update on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome.,"introduction: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction affecting 5% of the population. the cardinal symptoms are abdominal pain and altered stool form or frequency.
areas covered: diagnosis and management of ibs. we searched the literature for diagnostic accuracy studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses. a positive diagnosis of ibs, alongside testing to exclude celiac disease, is recommended. exhaustive investigation has a low yield. patients should be offered traditional dietary advice. if response is incomplete, specialist dietetic guidance should be considered. probiotics may be beneficial, but quality of evidence is poor. first-line treatment of constipation is with laxatives, with secretagogues used where these are ineffective. anti-diarrheal drugs should be used first-line for diarrhea, with second-line drugs including 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists, eluxadoline, or rifaximin, where available. first-line treatment of abdominal pain should be with antispasmodics, with gut-brain neuromodulators prescribed second-line. low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are preferred. brain-gut behavioral therapies are effective and have evidence for efficacy in patients refractory to standard therapies.
expert opinion: despite substantial advances, there remains scope for improvement in terms of both the diagnosis and management of ibs. reinforcement of positive diagnostic strategies for the condition and novel treatment paradigms are required.",Black CJ; Ford AC,2025,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,,,1-16,10.1080/17474124.2025.2455586,"Black, C.

aim: to evaluate the diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing patients with ibd from those with ibs methods: we searched medline, embase, scopus, and cochrane library databases up to 1 january 2023. studies were included if they assessed the diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing ibd from ibs (defined according to the rome criteria) using colonoscopy with histology or radiology as reference standard in adults. we calculated summary sensitivity and specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (ci) using a random-effect bivariate model. the risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies ii.
results: we included 17 studies with a total of 1956 patients. the summary sensitivity was 85.8% (95% ci: 78.3-91), and the specificity was 91.7% (95% ci: 84.5-95.7). at a prevalence of ibd of 1%, the negative predictive value was 99.8%, while the positive predictive value was only 9%. subgroup analyses showed a higher sensitivity in western than in eastern countries (88% vs 73%) and at a cut-off of ≤50 μg/g than at >50 μg/g (87% vs. 79%), with similar estimates of specificity. all studies were at ""high"" or ""unclear"" risk of bias.

design: we searched medline, embase, embase classic, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, and clinicaltrials.gov through january 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (rcts) assessing the efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies (alosetron, eluxadoline, ramosetron and rifaximin) in adults with ibs-d or ibs-m. trials included in the analysis reported a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, and data were pooled using a random effects model. efficacy and safety of all pharmacological therapies were reported as a pooled relative risk with 95% cis to summarise the effect of each comparison tested. treatments were ranked according to their p score.
results: we identified 18 eligible rcts (seven alosetron, five ramosetron, two rifaximin and four eluxadoline), containing 9844 patients. all were superior to placebo for the treatment of ibs-d or ibs-m at 12 weeks, according to the food and drug administration (fda)-recommended endpoint for trials in ibs. alosetron 1 mg twice daily was ranked first for efficacy, based on the fda-recommended composite endpoint of improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency, effect on global symptoms of ibs and effect on stool consistency. ramosetron 2.5μg once daily was ranked first for effect on abdominal pain. total numbers of adverse events were significantly greater with alosetron 1 mg twice daily and ramosetron 2.5μg once daily, compared with placebo. rifaximin 550 mg three times daily ranked first for safety. constipation was significantly more common with all drugs, except rifaximin 550 mg three times daily.

results: four studies were included in our review meeting criteria for our primary analysis. compared with those with no vedolizumab exposure, pregnancies with vedolizumab exposure had an increase in overall adverse pregnancy-related outcomes (odds ratio [or] 2.18, 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.52-3.13). the vedolizumab group also had increased preterm births (or 2.16, 95% ci, 1.28-3.66), and early loss of pregnancies (or 1.79, 95% ci, 1.06-3.01) but no difference in number of live births (or 0.60, 95%ci, 0.36-1.00), or congenital malformations (or 1.56, 95% ci, 0.56-4.37).
conclusions: our systematic review highlights possible concern with the general safety of vedolizumab in pregnancy, as an increase in overall total unfavorable outcomes was observed. premature births and early loss of pregnancy were also more prevalent in pregnant female patients on vedolizumab. it is possible these findings are confounded by disease activity, and further prospective cohort studies of vedolizumab and pregnancy outcomes are warranted.",Bell C; Tandon P; Lentz E; Marshall JK; Narula N,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,10,2640-2648,10.1111/jgh.15574,"Bell, C., Tandon, P., Lentz, E., Marshall, J.

37937498,risk of allergic rhinitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: numerous parallels exist between inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and allergic rhinitis (ar), which include risk factors (such as environmental and genetic factors), pathogenesis (immune disorders, epithelial cell barriers, etc.), and treatment (immunosuppressants and immunomodulators, such as cyclosporine and steroids). however, the risk of ar in ibd patients is unknown.
objective: in this systematic review and meta-analysis, patients with ibd are examined for their risk of ar.
methods: several databases are accessible in both chinese and english, including pubmed, biorxiv, wanfang, the china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki), web of science, metstr, and medrxiv. findings presented at allergy, rhinology, thoracic, and gastrointestinal conferences were analyzed. based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two evaluators independently retrieved data, read the literature, and evaluated bias risk. the data analysis was conducted using revman 5.4. case-control and cohort studies were eligible study designs for this research.
results: there were 10 case-control studies and 1 cohort study included in the meta-analysis. the experimental group consisted of 65,687 ibd patients, of whom 5838 had ar. a total of 345,176 participants without ibd were included in the control group, of whom 24,625 developed ar. the outcomes demonstrated that ibd patients had a higher risk of developing ar (odds ratio [or] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [ci] [1.12, 1.95], z = 2.78, p = 0.005) than those without ibd.
conclusion: the risk of ar is higher in ibd patients. further investigation is required to determine the mechanism behind the association between ar and ibd.",Liu J; Cai L; Yang R; Wei L; Luo H; Gui X,2023,Allergologia et immunopathologia,51,6,67-75,10.15586/aei.v51i6.943,"Liu, J., Cai, L., Yang, R., Wei, L., Luo, H., & Gui, X.

34114657,systematic review and network meta-analysis: efficacy of licensed drugs for abdominal bloating in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.,"background: although bloating is a highly prevalent and troublesome symptom in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c), treatment is empirical with no specific guidelines for its management.
aim: to conduct a pairwise and network meta-analysis, using a frequentist approach, of food and drug administration-licensed drugs for ibs-c comparing their efficacy for abdominal bloating as a specific endpoint.
methods: we searched the medical literature through december 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (rcts) in ibs-c, with abdominal bloating reported as a dichotomous assessment. efficacy of each drug was reported as a pooled relative risk (rr) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) to summarise effect of each comparison tested. treatments were ranked according to their p-score.
results: we identified 13 eligible rcts, containing 10 091 patients. linaclotide 290 μg o.d., lubiprostone 8 μg b.d., tenapanor 50 mg b.d. and tegaserod 6 mg b.d. were all superior to placebo for abdominal bloating in patients with ibs-c, in both pairwise and the network meta-analyses. linaclotide demonstrated the greatest improvement in abdominal bloating in both pairwise and network meta-analysis (rr of failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal bloating = 0.78; 95% ci 0.74-0.83, number needed to treat = 7, p-score 0.97). indirect comparison revealed no significant differences between individual drugs.
conclusions: we found all licensed drugs for ibs-c to be superior to placebo for abdominal bloating. linaclotide appeared to be the most efficacious at relieving abdominal bloating. further research is needed to assess long-term efficacy of these agents and to better understand the precise mechanism of improving bloating.",Nelson AD; Black CJ; Houghton LA; Lugo-Fagundo NS; Lacy BE; Ford AC,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,2,98-108,10.1111/apt.16437,"Nelson, A.

36990003,the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review & meta-analysis.,"background: mental health has been identified as contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). resultingly, psychotherapeutic interventions, such as mindfulness-based interventions (mbi), have been increasingly investigated for improving ibd outcomes.
objectives: to systematically review the current state of evidence of mbi's for individuals living with ibd.
methods: we performed a systematic review searching medline, psychinfo, cinahl, embase, cochrane and scopus, to identify controlled clinical trials, investigating mbi's for various ibd biopsychosocial outcomes. data was pooled using the inverse-variance random effects model, with restricted maximum likelihood estimation, providing the standardized mean difference (smd) between control and experimental groups, at both short and long-term follow up.
results: we identified 8 studies with 575 participants. meta-analytic results found that mbi's were more efficacious than control groups in the short-term improvement of stress (smd = -0.38, 95% ci [-0.65, -0.10], p = 0.007), mindfulness (smd = 0.59, 95% ci [0.36, 0.83], p = 0.00001), c-reactive protein (crp) (smd = -0.25, 95% ci [-0.49, -0.01], p = 0.04) and health-related quality of life (hrqol) (smd = 0.45, 95% ci [0.24, 0.66], p = 0.0001) (including all emotional, bowel, social and systemic subscales). this was maintained in the long-term for stress (smd = -0.44, 95% ci [-0.88, -0.01], p < 0.05) and mindfulness (smd = 0.52, 95% ci [0.14, 0.90], p = 0.008), but not for hrqol, with no long-term data available for crp.

37565634,probiotics for the management of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and three-level meta-analysis.,"objective: previous systematic reviews demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). however, these studies are either affected by the inclusion of insufficient trials or by the problem of dependent data across multiple outcomes, and an overall effect size has not been provided. we aimed to determine the effect of probiotics on ibs through a three-level meta-analysis and clarify potential effect moderators.
methods: we searched medline, embase, and web of science, screening for randomized controlled trials (rcts) that examine the effect of probiotics on ibs. the primary outcome was the improvement in the severity of global ibs symptoms at the end of treatment. the secondary outcomes were the improvement in abdominal pain and the quality of life. the effect sizes of the probiotics were measured by using the standardized mean difference (smd) and pooled by a three-level meta-analysis model.
results: we included 72 rcts in the analysis. the meta-analysis showed significantly better overall effect of probiotics than placebo on the global ibs symptoms (smd -0.55, 95% ci -0.76 to -0.34, p <0.001), abdominal pain (smd -0.89, 95% ci -1.29 to -0.5, p <0.001) and quality of life (smd 0.99, 95% ci 0.45 to 1.54, p <0.001), respectively. moderator analysis found that a treatment duration shorter than 4 weeks was associated with a larger effect size in all the outcomes, and bacillus probiotics had better improvement on the abdominal pain.
conclusions: probiotics had a short-term effect and a medium effect size on the global ibs symptoms. treatment duration and types of probiotics affected the effect size of probiotics, and shorter durations and bacillus probiotics were associated with better treatment effects.

36682029,systematic review with meta-analysis: the impact of cancer treatments on the disease activity of inflammatory bowel diseases.,"background and aims: the association between cancer treatments and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel diseases [ibd] is unclear. we aimed to evaluate the effects of cancer treatments on the disease activity of ibd.
methods: we performed a systematic review of the literature on cancer therapy in patients with pre-existing ibd. electronic searches of pubmed, cochrane library and embase were combined with manual searches (september 2021). meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. the primary outcome was flares of ibd following cancer therapy. secondary outcomes were need for ibd-related hospitalization, surgery, and initiation or intensification of steroid or biological treatments to manage ibd flares.
results: in total, 33 studies were included in the systematic review, comprising 1298 patients with ibd who received cancer treatment. the overall occurrence of ibd flares following cancer treatment was 30% (95% confidence interval [ci] 23-37%). ibd flares resulted in utilization of systemic steroids and biologic therapies among 25% and 10% of patients, respectively, and in discontinuation of cancer treatment among 14% of patients. finally, the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity following immune check point inhibitor treatment [ici] was increased in patients with ibd compared to patients without ibd (rr = 3.62 [95% ci 2.57-5.09]). despite this, the studies generally reported that flares were manageable.
conclusions: current data indicate a high proportion of patients with ibd experiencing a flare following the start of cancer treatment. patients with ibd were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity following ici treatment compared to those without ibd. however, cancer therapy-induced ibd flares were manageable and should not preclude appropriate cancer treatments.",Grimsdottir S; Attauabi M; Kristine Dahl E; Burisch J; Seidelin JB,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,7,1139-1153,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad010,"Grimsdottir, S., Attauabi, M., Kristine Dahl, E., Burisch, J., & Seidelin, J.

38024368,"gluten restriction in irritable bowel syndrome, yes or no?: a grade-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.","background: more than half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) report aggravating their symptoms with certain foods. currently, low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols diet (lfd) is the most accepted dietary intervention for ibs. recent randomized controlled trials (rcts) have been suggested that gluten restriction may reduce the symptoms of patients with ibs. however, the results from these studies are conflicting. this study filled this knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of the gluten-free diet (gfd) on ibs symptoms.
methods: a systematic search was carried out in pubmed/medline, cochrane central, scopus, and web of science up to april 2023. a random-effect model was applied to estimate the standardized mean difference (smd) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) for each outcome.
results: a total of nine controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. in contrast to gluten-containing diet, gfd was unable to reduce overall symptoms (smd - 0.31; 95% ci -0.92, 0.31), bloating (smd -0.37; 95% ci -1.03, 0.30), and quality of life (smd -0.12, 95% ci -0.64, 0.39); but had a slight trend to reduce abdominal pain (smd -0.68; 95% ci -1.36, -0.00). also, lfd significantly reduced the ibs-severity score system (smd 0.66, 95% ci 0.31, 1.01) and improved quality of life (smd -0.36, 95% ci -0.70, -0.01), compared to gfd.

39129703,mindfulness-based interventions on psychological comorbidities in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic, lifelong disease, so ibd patients are highly susceptible to negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression, resulting in a reduced quality of life. mindfulness-based intervention (mbi) is widely used to reduce stress, anxiety and depression in people. therefore, this study conducted a systematic review of mindfulness-based intervention training on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in patients with ibd through meta-analysis.
methods: search papers in pubmed, web of science, cochrane library, google scholar, cnki, wanfang, and embase databases. the search time limit was from the establishment of the database to may 2023. randomized controlled trial studies of the effect of mindfulness intervention training on patients with ibd were screened, the included results were integrated and analyzed, and reviewmanager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis.
results: a total of 14 studies with a total of 1030 ibd patients were included. a total of 10 studies showed that the anxiety of patients in the mindfulness intervention group was significantly reduced by (standard mean difference (smd) = -0.73, 95% confidence interval (ci): -1.01 to -0.45) compared to the control group. 8 studies showed that the intervention group significantly reduced patients' depression (smd = -0.60, 95% ci: -0.78 to -0.42). 7 studies showed that the patient's quality of life improved after mindfulness intervention (smd = 0.66, 95% ci: 0.45-0.87).

37219801,the effect of biological treatment on fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: fatigue is a frequent complaint in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. biological drugs have demonstrated beneficial effects on some extraintestinal manifestations, but the effect on fatigue is not clear.
objective: this study investigated the effects of biological and small molecule drugs approved for inflammatory bowel disease on fatigue.
methods: we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials reporting federal drug agency (fda)-approved biological and small molecule drugs for use in ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease in which measures of fatigue were recorded before and after treatment. only induction studies were included. maintenance studies were excluded. we searched embase (ovid), medline (ovid), psycinfo (ovid), cinahl (ebscohost), web of science core collection, cochrane central register of controlled trials, and clinicaltrials.gov in may 2022. risk of bias was analyzed using the cochrane risk-of-bias tool. standardized mean difference was used to measure the treatment effect.
results: a total of seven randomized controlled trials composed of 3835 patients were included in the meta-analysis. all of the studies included patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease. the studies used three different generic fatigue instruments: the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue and the short form 36 health survey vitality subscale versions 1 and 2. overall treatment with biological or small molecule agents showed a beneficial effect compared with placebo, with a standardized mean difference of 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.15-0.34, p < 0.001). the effect was independent of type of drug or subtype of inflammatory bowel disease.
discussion: the risk of bias was considered to be low for all domains except for missing outcome data. even though the included studies were of high methodological quality, the review is limited by the small number of studies included and that the available studies were not designed to evaluate fatigue specifically.

38970234,the association between bilirubin concentrations and inflammatory bowel disease: insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), poses a significant challenge to health care systems because of its chronic nature and increasing global prevalence. effective management of ibd requires accurate diagnostic tools and biomarkers. this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between bilirubin concentrations and ibd activity and outcomes.
methods: a comprehensive search of electronic databases identified 11 studies that included 2606 subjects with ibd and 3607 healthy controls.
results: bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with ibd when compared to controls (smd = -0.96, 95% ci -1.21 to -0.70; p < .001). although substantial heterogeneity was observed, sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. publication bias was detected, but subgroup analyses did not significantly alter the results. meta-regression showed that age was a significant factor influencing the association between bilirubin concentrations and ibd. subgroup analyses showed a more pronounced reduction in bilirubin concentrations in subjects with cd than those with uc.

aim: we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the different interventions intended to increase vaccination rates.
methods: a systematic search was conducted of medline/pubmed, embase, cinahl, and cochrane library up to 2020 for studies with interventions intended to increase vaccination rates. we performed a random-effects meta-analysis to generate pooled odds ratios (ors) to assess all interventions against no interventions. our primary outcome was pneumococcal vaccination (pcv) rate.
results: our review found 8580 articles, for which 15 ibd and 8 ra articles met the inclusion criteria; 21 articles were included in the analysis. pcv was the predominant vaccination (91%). in our analysis of patients with ibd, almost all interventions (patient-oriented, physician-oriented, or barrier-oriented) increased pcv uptake [or, 4.74; 95% ci, 2.44-6.56, i2 = 90%] compared to no intervention. the greatest effect was seen in barrier-oriented studies [or, 12.68; 95% ci, 2.21-72.62, i2 = 92%]. for ra data, all interventions had increased pcv uptake compared to no interventions (or 2.74; 95% ci, 1.80-4.17, i2 = 95%).
conclusion: our data suggest that many different interventions can increase pcv rates. it appears that barrier-oriented interventions may have the greatest positive effect on increasing pcv uptake. however, clinicians should be encouraged to implement measures best suited to their practice. future high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the best approach to optimize vaccination rates.",Patel J; Noureldin M; Fakhouri D; Farraye FA; Kovar-Gough I; Warren B; Waljee AK; Piper MS,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,7,2921-2935,10.1007/s10620-023-07903-7,"Patel, J., Noureldin, M., Fakhouri, D., Farraye, F.

methods: electronic databases were searched up to december 2018 for studies reporting sibo prevalence in patients with ibs. prevalence rates, odds ratios (ors), and 95% confidence intervals (cis) of sibo in patients with ibs and controls were calculated.
results: we included 25 studies with 3,192 patients with ibs and 3,320 controls. sibo prevalence in patients with ibs was significantly increased compared with controls (or = 3.7, 95% ci 2.3-6.0). in studies using only healthy controls, the or for sibo in patients with ibs was 4.9 (95% ci 2.8-8.6). with breath testing, sibo prevalence in patients with ibs was 35.5% (95% ci 33.6-37.4) vs 29.7% (95% ci 27.6-31.8) in controls. culture-based studies yielded a sibo prevalence of 13.9% (95% ci 11.5-16.4) in patients with ibs and 5.0% (95% ci 3.9-6.2) in controls with a cutoff value of 10 colony-forming units per milliliter vs 33.5% (95% ci 30.1-36.9) in patients with ibs and 8.2% (95% ci 6.8-9.6) in controls with a cutoff value of 10 colony-forming unit per milliliter, respectively. sibo prevalence diagnosed by lactulose breath test is much greater in both patients with ibs (3.6-fold) and controls (7.6-fold) compared with glucose breath test. similar difference is seen when lactulose breath test is compared with culture methods. or for sibo in patients with ibs-diarrhea compared with ibs-constipation was 1.86 (95% ci 1.83-2.8). methane-positive breath tests were significantly more prevalent in ibs-constipation compared with ibs-diarrhea (or = 2.3, 95% ci 1.2-4.2). in patients with ibs, proton pump inhibitor was not associated with sibo (or = 0.8, 95% ci 0.5-1.5, p = 0.55).

39968993,diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: an official position paper from the brazilian federation of gastroenterology.,"background: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) is a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in bacterial population in the small intestine, leading to symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea, and eventually malabsorption. the diagnosis and management of sibo remain challenging due to overlapping symptoms with other gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and coeliac disease.
objective: this article aims to review current evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of sibo, with a focus on strategies suitable for the brazilian healthcare system.
methods: a comprehensive literature review was performed, focusing on clinical guidelines, randomized controlled trials, and cohort studies concerning sibo. diagnostic methods, including breath tests and direct aspiration techniques, were critically analyzed. treatment approaches, including antibiotics, dietary modifications, and probiotics, were reviewed. the recommendations were formulated based on a panel of gastroenterologists, members of the brazilian federation of gastroenterology (fbg), with approval from the majority of the members.
results: breath tests using glucose and lactulose remain the most commonly used non-invasive diagnostic tools, though they are subject to limitations such as false positives and false negatives. treatment with rifaximin is effective in most cases of sibo, while systemic antibiotics like metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are alternatives. probiotics and dietary interventions, particularly low fodmap diets, can complement antibiotic therapy. long-term follow-up is essential due to the recurrence rate, which is common in sibo patients.
conclusion: standardizing sibo diagnosis and treatment in brazil is essential to reduce diagnostic delays and optimize care, especially given the disparities and heterogeneity in clinical practice across the country. this article provides evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice. further research is needed to refine diagnostic methods, explore novel treatment strategies, and better understand the specific characteristics of the brazilian population.",Silva BCD; Ramos GP; Barros LL; Ramos AFP; Domingues G; Chinzon D; Passos MDCF,2025,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,62,,e24107,10.1590/S0004-2803.24612024-107,"Silva, B.

38261245,post-infection irritable bowel syndrome following coronavirus disease-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"unlabelled: background and objectives: persistent gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders (fgids) are increasingly being recognized after coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19). though quite a few studies addressed irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) following covid-19, the disorders' prevalence varies greatly. we evaluated, (i) overall frequency of post-covid-19 ibs, (ii) relative risk of development of ibs among covid-19 patients compared to healthy controls using systematic review and meta-analysis techniques.
methods: literature search was performed for studies on gi symptoms and fgids after covid-19 using electronic databases (medline, scopus, cochrane central register of controlled trials, google scholar and web of science) till april 28, 2023. we included studies reporting ibs after covid-19 with any duration of follow-up and any number of subjects. studies on pediatric population and those not providing relevant information were excluded. relative risk of development of ibs using rome criteria among covid-19 patients compared to healthy controls was calculated. analysis was done using medcalc (applied math, mariakerke, belgium, version 7.2) and comprehensive meta-analysis version 3.3.070 (biostat inc. englewood, nj 07631, usa).
results: of the available studies, 13 (four case-control) reporting on ibs after covid-19 met inclusion criteria. among 3950 covid-19 patients and 991 controls, 7.2% of covid-19 patients and 4.9% of healthy controls developed ibs. of the four case-control studies reporting post-covid-19 ibs, patients with covid-19 were 2.65 (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.538 to 13.039) times more likely to have post-covid-19 ibs as compared to healthy controls.

37489108,platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio in inflammatory bowel disease and disease activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"objective: this review aimed to examine if the platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio can be useful in determining disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
methods: pubmed, central, scopus, embase, and web of science were searched for studies published up to 9 january 2023. platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values from active and remission inflammatory bowel disease cases were compared to generate a mean difference (md).
results: nine studies were included. meta-analysis showed that inflammatory bowel disease patients with active disease had significantly higher values of platelet-lymphocyte ratio as compared to those in remission (md: 63.46 95% ci: 35.74, 91.17, i2 = 89%). the values of platelet-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in both active ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease patients. meta-analysis also showed that lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values were significantly lower in active inflammatory bowel disease patients as compared to those under remission (md: -1.28 95% ci: -1.42, -1.14, i2 = 4%). lymphocyte-monocyte ratio values were significantly lower in both ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease patients with active disease.
conclusion: platelet-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio can be useful blood-based markers in differentiating active disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients. active cases of ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease have high platelet-lymphocyte ratio and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio as compared to those in remission. further studies with a larger sample size are needed to strengthen conclusions.",Gao L; Zhan Y; Hu X; Liao S,2023,Scottish medical journal,68,3,101-109,10.1177/00369330231188962,"Gao, L., Zhan, Y., Hu, X., & Liao, S.

35920906,colorectal cancer risk of flat low-grade dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis.,"background: to date, the optimal management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and flat low-grade dysplasia (flgd) of the colon or rectum remains controversial.
methods: a systematic review was reported in accordance with prisma 2020 (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). patients diagnosed with flgd on surveillance endoscopy were pooled from studies published between 2000 and 2020. advanced neoplasia was defined by the presence of hgd, crc or small bowel adenocarcinoma detected on subsequent surveillance endoscopy or from examination of resection specimens. we estimated the pooled annual incidence rate of colorectal cancer (crc) and advanced neoplasia, and the risk factors associated with neoplastic progression.
results: we identified 24 articles and 738 ibd patients were diagnosed with flgd on endoscopy. two hundred thirty-six patients (32%) underwent immediate surgery with surgical specimens demonstrating crc in 8 patients (pooled prevalence, 8.66%; 95% ci 3.58-19.46) and hgd (high grade dysplasia) in 11 patients (pooled prevalence, 13.97%; 95% ci 5.65-30.65). five hundred-two patients (68%) underwent endoscopic surveillance with 63 patients with flgd progressing to advanced neoplasia during endoscopic surveillance (38 hgd, 24 crc and one patient developing small bowel adenocarcinoma). the mean duration of follow-up after flgd diagnosis was 71 months (10.9-212). the pooled incidence of crc and advanced neoplasia was 0.5 (95% ci 0.23-0.77) and 1.71 per 100 patient-year (95% ci 0.88-2.54) respectively. the use of corticosteroids and location of flgd in the distal colon were significantly associated with neoplastic progression.

36322453,role of pharmacogenomics in the efficacy and safety of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: thiopurines' toxicity often leads to dose reduction or discontinuation. this systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence on the effect of genotype-based dosing of thiopurines on treatment efficacy and safety in inflammatory bowel disease (objective #1), and the association between genotype status and the efficacy and safety profile (objective #2).
methods: the cochrane library, medline, and embase were searched in august 2021. a total of 80 studies (19,859 individuals) were included. meta-analyses for mortality, different types of adverse events (aes), withdrawal due to ae, change in disease activity and clinical remission were performed following mainly a fixed-effects model. prospero registration: crd42020148130.
results: genotype-based dosing was associated to a significantly lower incidence of hematologic aes (risk ratio=0.71; 95% ci: 0.56-0.90; i2 : 47%; 4 randomized controlled trials; moderate quality), which may be attributable to nudix hydrolase 15 (nudt15) testing more than to thiopurine methyltransferase (tpmt) genotyping. no differences were found in other outcomes. mutations in tpmt and nudt15 genes were associated to a higher probability of serious aes [odds ratio (or) tpmt=4.98; or nudt15=11.44], hematologic aes (or tpmt=3.18), and serious hematologic aes (or tpmt=7.88; or nudt15=12.83). tpmt was also associated with a higher risk of withdrawals due to aes (or=3.38), and nudt15 with gastrointestinal aes (or=2.04). mutations in the itpa gene did not lead to significant differences. evidence of an association between other genes and clinical outcomes is still scarce.

36997007,assessment of anti-inflammatory efficacy of acupuncture in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: inflammation has a significant role in the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). increasing attention has been paid to the use of acupuncture in ibd patients; however, its regulatory effects on inflammatory factors in ibd still require validation. here, we systematically evaluated the effects of acupuncture on inflammatory factors in ibd patients.
methods: eight electronic databases were searched for studies that met the inclusion criteria. after evaluating the quality of the studies selected by two reviewers, the meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in ibd patients and the impact on inflammatory factors (tnf-α, il-1, il-8 and il-10).
results: four randomized controlled trials with a total of 228 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. acupuncture has a positive therapeutic impact on ibd (md = 1.22, 95% ci [1.07, 1.39], p = 0.003). moreover, it regulates the levels of tnf-α (md =-60.58, 95% ci [-100.30, -20.89], p = 0.003), il-8 (md =-56.40, 95% ci [-60.02, -52.14], p < 0.00001) and il-10 (md =35.96, 95% ci [11.02, 60.91], p = 0.005) in ibd patients. however, the p value of meta-analysis in il-1 great than 0.05.(md =-27.90, 95% ci [-97.82, 42.02], p = 0.11).

40229330,the impact of inflammatory bowel disease on dementia risk: a current systematic review and meta-analysis.,"emerging evidence indicates that inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and dementia may share underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors. however, the association between a prior ibd diagnosis and the subsequent risk of dementia remains largely unexplored. we conducted a comprehensive search of pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library up to february 4, 2025, without language restrictions. two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated methodological quality and risk of bias. observational studies comparing dementia risk in ibd and non-ibd populations were included. pooled effect estimates for odds ratios (or) were calculated using random-effects models. a total of 10 population-based studies, involving 7,895,339 participants (269,387 with ibd), were included. meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant association between ibd and dementia risk (or 1.17, 95% ci: 1.08-1.27, p = 0.0001). however, ibd was not associated with an increased risk of alzheimer's disease (ad) (or 1.15, 95% ci: 0.98-1.36, p = 0.09). stratified analysis by ibd type revealed a positive association between both ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd) and dementia risk (uc: or 1.15, 95% ci: 1.05-1.25, p = 0.002, i2 = 81%; cd: or 1.26, 95% ci: 1.11-1.43, p = 0.0003, i2 = 53%). this study identifies a significant correlation between ibd and dementia, suggesting that ibd patients have an elevated risk of developing dementia. however, current evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. further research should explore whether effective ibd treatments can mitigate this risk and elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these conditions.",Peng TR; Lin HH; Yang LJ; Huang YY; Wu TW; Chao YC,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,12852,10.1038/s41598-025-96331-w,"Peng, T.

33346998,alterations in heart rate variability associated with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"introduction: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are gastrointestinal pathologies affecting large numbers of the global population and incurring significant healthcare costs. disruptions in the gut-brain axis occurring in these conditions can lead to increased inflammation, affecting gastrointestinal and autonomic nervous system function. heart rate variability (hrv) is commonly used to assess the state of the sympathetic and parasympathetic function of the autonomic nervous system, but it remains unclear how hrv measures are associated with gastrointestinal pathologies. here, we conduct a systematic review of the literature comparing hrv of subjects diagnosed with ibs or ibd to hrv in healthy controls (hc).
methods: we searched pubmed, cochrane library, and cinahl (ebsco) for eligible studies up to 2018. we included any study comparing a recognized measure of hrv between a group of patients with either ibs or ibd to a group of matched hc before any intervention. studies were screened, and data were extracted from included articles using predefined criteria. random effects meta-analysis was performed for each outcome, with effect size reported as the standardized mean difference.
results: there were significant differences between ibd and hc in time domain hrv and significant decreases in high-frequency power measures were also noted, in both ibs and ibd compared with hc.
discussion: parasympathetic nervous system activity, represented through high-frequency power, seems to be lower in people with ibs and ibd, but conclusions are limited by the small number of studies that provide usable data, methodological heterogeneity, and high risks of bias in primary study methods and measures.",Sadowski A; Dunlap C; Lacombe A; Hanes D,2020,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,12,1,e00275,10.14309/ctg.0000000000000275,"Sadowski, A., Dunlap, C., Lacombe, A., & Hanes, D.

36579768,effectiveness of vitamin d supplementation on disease course in inflammatory bowel disease patients: systematic review with meta-analysis.,"background: the vitamin d role in bone metabolism is well known; however, recent evidence suggests the impact of vitamin d in immune modulation and its implications in immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
method: we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis by a specific protocol (prospero: crd42022311184; march 2022, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?recordid=311184). randomized clinical trials involving ibd patients treated with vitamin d supplementation, compared with placebo, that evaluated the risk of clinical relapse and disease activity were included. literature search was performed using medline, scopus, and cochrane central through january 2022.
results: out of 1448 articles, 12 (11 full-texts and 1 abstract) were included. seven randomized clinical trials reported data on the clinical relapse as dichotomous outcome, while 7 studies reported data on disease activity expressed as continuous variables. the pooled risk ratio of clinical relapse was 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.89; i2 = 25%) among 458 ibd patients. however, this seems to be solid only in crohn's disease (cd) patients. in fact, only 2 studies, involving 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, were included in the analysis. cd patients in clinical remission had a strong significant risk reduction in clinical relapse (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.82; i2 = 0%), suggesting that it could be a specific subgroup with maximum clinical benefit of vitamin d supplementation.
conclusions: this meta-analysis shows that vitamin d supplementation can reduce the risk of clinical relapse in ibd patients, especially in cd patients in clinical remission. in a subgroup analysis, it was not significant (due to small number of studies and low number of patients), and well-powered studies are needed, in particular for ulcerative colitis patients.",Valvano M; Magistroni M; Cesaro N; Carlino G; Monaco S; Fabiani S; Vinci A; Vernia F; Viscido A; Latella G,2024,Inflammatory bowel diseases,30,2,281-291,10.1093/ibd/izac253,"Valvano, M., Magistroni, M., Cesaro, N., Carlino, G., Monaco, S., Fabiani, S., Vinci, A., Vernia, F., Viscido, A., & Latella, G.

35396764,vitamin d supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and aim: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a prevalent and complex gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. observational studies have suggested a relationship between serum vitamin d levels and ibs symptoms. this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the clinical effects of vitamin d supplementation on ibs symptom severity and quality of life (qol) measures.
methods: medline, embase, scopus, web of science, and the cochrane library databases were systematically searched. data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by four authors independently, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus from the senior author. continuous data were pooled with standardized mean difference (smd) using the dersimonian and laird's random-effects model. sensitivity analysis by risk of bias and potentially ""predatory"" publication were performed as well.
results: a total of 685 patients across eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. vitamin d supplementation significantly improved ibs symptom severity scale scores, with a smd of -0.77 (95% confidence interval [ci] -1.47 to -0.07, p = 0.04, i2 = 91%). improvements in ibs-qol scores were also observed, albeit not statistically significant (smd 0.54; 95% ci -0.34 to 1.41, p = 0.15, i2 = 87%). however, small sample sizes, a relatively young study population, limited ethnicities, and varied vitamin d dosing strategies across the studies were notable limitations.

34049374,postinfection irritable bowel syndrome following clostridioides difficile infection: a systematic-review and meta-analysis.,"background: postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (pi-ibs) affects ~14% patients after acute bacterial enterocolitis.
aim: the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of pi-ibs following clostridioides difficile infection (cdi).
methods: we systematically searched medline, embase, and web of science from inception through january 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing pi-ibs following cdi. primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [metaxl (v. 5.3)]. a priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) diagnostic criteria-rome vs. others, time of ibs diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing ibs and cdi treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. heterogeneity was considered substantial if i2>50%.
results: from 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies. pooled prevalence of pi-ibs was 21.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2%-35.7%), i2=96%. common pi-ibs subtypes were diarrhea-predominant in 46.3% (50) patients, and mixed in 33.3% (36) patients. subgroup analyses by ibs diagnostic criteria, time of ibs diagnosis or cdi treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all p>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias.

38740543,the impact of vedolizumab therapy on extraintestinal manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and aim: extraintestinal manifestations (eims) pose a significant threat in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. vedolizumab (vdz) primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract. however, its impact on eims remains uncertain. therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to examine the effects of vdz on eims during treatment.
methods: relevant studies were identified by conducting thorough searches across electronic databases, including pubmed, ovid embase, medline, and cochrane central. primary outcomes focused on the proportion of patients with resolution for pre-existing eims in ibd patients receiving vdz. secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with eim exacerbations and new onset eims during vdz treatment.
results: our meta-analysis encompassed 21 studies. the proportion of patients with resolution of pre-existing eims in vdz-treated ibd patients was 39% (150/386; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.31-0.48). the proportion of patients with eim exacerbations occurred at a rate of 28% (113/376; 95% ci 0.05-0.50), while new onset eims had a rate of 15% (397/2541; 95% ci 0.10-0.20). subgroup analysis revealed a 40% (136/337) proportion of patients with resolution for articular-related eims and a 50% (9/18) rate for erythema nodosum. exacerbation rates for arthritis/arthralgia, erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum, and aphthous stomatitis during vdz use were 28% (102/328), 18% (7/38), and 11% (3/28), respectively. the incidence rate of newly developed eims during treatment was 11% (564/4839) for articular-related eims, with other eims below 2%.

methods: systematic search was done in pubmed, embase, central, scopus, and cinahl databases for studies published till september 2023. using a random-effects model, the hazard ratios (hrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for stroke occurrence were calculated. subgroup analyses were done to estimate pooled hr with 95%ci for cd, uc, and overall ibd cases separately. publication bias assessment was done by begg's and egger's tests.
results: thirteen studies with 2,802,955 participants were included. ibd patients in general had significantly higher risk of stroke, with hr of 1.30 [95% ci 1.21-1.39]. subgroup analysis demonstrated an hr of 1.35 [95% ci 1.22-1.49] for cd and 1.15 [95% ci 1.09-1.22] for uc. substantial heterogeneity was detected across studies, with no substantial publication bias. sensitivity analyses affirmed the stability of findings.
conclusion: ibd in general, and crohn's disease in particular are associated with significantly higher risk of stroke. our findings further emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk assessment and management strategies in ibd care.

methods: a search was performed in pubmed, embase, cochrane, and web of science. eligible articles included randomized controlled trials or prospective observational studies that compared a prebiotic with a placebo or lower-dose control in patients with ibd. meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models for the outcomes of clinical remission, clinical relapse, and adverse events.
results: seventeen studies were included. for induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis (uc), the fructooligosaccharide (fos) kestose was effective (relative risk, 2.75, 95% confidence interval, 1.05-7.20; n = 40), but oligofructose-enriched inulin (of-in) and lactulose were not. for maintenance of remission in uc, germinated barley foodstuff trended toward preventing clinical relapse (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-1.03; n = 59), but of-in, oat bran, and plantago ovata did not. for crohn's disease, of-in and lactulose were no different than controls for induction of remission, and fos was no different than controls for maintenance of remission. flatulence and bloating were more common with of-in; reported adverse events were otherwise similar to controls for other prebiotics.

38589784,anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy may not be safe during pregnancy in women with inflammatory bowel disease: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) affects reproductive-aged women. active disease can lead to decreased fertility. although the vast majority of international guidelines recommend for the continuation of anti-tnf-α during pregnancy, recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) therapy during pregnancy, both for patients and for physicians.
methods: studies that evaluate the safety of anti-tnf-α therapy in pregnant women with ibd were identified using bibliographical searches. an updated meta-analysis was performed for pregnancy outcomes, such as live birth, abortion, still birth, preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, and neonatal infection. odds ratio (or) with 95% confidence interval (ci) are reported. data on disease activity, timing of anti-tnf-α therapy were collected for further analysis.
results: overall, 11 studies were screened from on-line databases and international meeting abstracts. an increased risk of abortion (or, 1.33; 95% ci, 1.02-1.74; p = 0.04) and preterm birth (or, 1.16; 95% ci, 1.05-1.28; p = 0.004), and a decreased risk of live birth (or, 0.83; 95% ci, 0.74-0.94; p = 0.002]) were found in the anti-tnf-α therapy group compared with the control group (no use of anti-tnf-α therapy). the subgroup analyses based on the disease activity showed there is no significant association between the use of anti-tnf-α therapy during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes of abortion, preterm birth, and live birth. the rates of still birth, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities in the anti-tnf-α therapy group were not significantly different from those in the control group.
conclusions: anti-tnf-α therapy does not increase the risks of still birth, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities; however it may be assicated with increased risks of abortion and preterm birth, which are accompanied by a lower rate of live birth. although these findings may be confounding by potential disease activity, they offer some opposite viewpoints with biologic agent use. therefore, more studies are required to further confirm the safety of anti-tnf-α therapy in pregnancy with ibd.",Huang W; Zhang X; Zhang L; Dai X; Chen H; Xie Q,2024,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,24,1,251,10.1186/s12884-024-06443-w,"Huang, W., Zhang, X., Zhang, L., Dai, X., Chen, H., & Xie, Q.

34872306,efficacy and safety of probiotics in the induction and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease remission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: probiotics have been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) due to their special conditioning effects on the intestinal flora, but their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission is still controversial. in the present study, we analyzed randomized controlled trials (rcts) on the treatment of probiotics in ibd to systematically evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission of ibd.
methods: pubmed, cochrane central register of controlled trials, embase, web of science, chinese journal full-text database, chinese biomedical literature database, wanfang, and weipu databases were searched for rcts on the treatment of probiotics in ibd induction and/or maintenance of remission. two researchers independently extracted literature data and cross-checked the extracted data. the cochrane bias risk assessment tool and the jadad score were used to evaluate the quality of the literature. revman 5.20 software was used for the meta-analysis.
results: a total of ten rcts were included, which included 777 patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the clinical recurrence rate of probiotics in the cd remission phase and the control group [relative risk (rr): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.61-1.06, p=0.12]. the clinical recurrence rate of uc in remission phase, the efficacy of probiotics compared with control group were not significantly different (rr: 1.07, 95% ci: 0.80-1.42, p=0.65). the induction remission rate of uc during the active phase, the efficacy of probiotics is better than that of the control group (rr: 1.47, 95% ci: 1.09-1.98, p=0.01).

32762830,cannabis and the gastrointestinal tract.,"unlabelled: cannabis has been used for its medicinal purposes since ancient times. its consumption leads to the activation of cannabis receptors cb1 and cb2 that, through specific mechanisms can lead to modulation and progression of inflammation or repair. the novel findings are linked to the medical use of cannabis in gastrointestinal (gi) system.
purpose: the objective of the present paper is to elucidate the role of cannabis consumption in gi system. an additional aim is to review the information on the function of cannabis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld).
methods and results: this review summarizes the recent findings on the role of cannabinoid receptors, their synthetic or natural ligands, as well as their metabolizing enzymes in normal gi function and its disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and possible adverse events. the synergism or antagonism between cannabis' active ingredients and the ""entourage"" plays a role in the efficacy of various strains. some elements of cannabis may alter disease severity as over-activation of cannabis receptors cb1 and cb2 can lead to changes of the commensal gut flora. the endocannabinoid system (ecs) contributes to gut homeostasis. the ability of ecs to modulate inflammatory responses demonstrates the capacity of ecs to preserve gastrointestinal (gi) function. alterations of the ecs may predispose patients to pathologic disorders, including ibd. clinical studies in ibd demonstrate that subjects benefit from cannabis consumption as seen through a reduction of the ibd-inflammation, as well as through a decreased need for other medication. nafld is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver. the occurrence of inflammation in nafld leads to non-alcoholic-steatohepatitis (nash). the use of cannabis might reduce liver inflammation.
conclusions: with limited evidence of efficacy and safety of cannabis in ibd, ibs, and nafld, randomized controlled studies are required to examine its therapeutic efficacy. moreover, since long term use of the plant leads to drug use disorders the patients should be followed continuously.",Cohen L; Neuman MG,2020,"Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",23,,301-313,10.18433/jpps31242,"Cohen, L., & Neuman, M.

36977983,thiols as a marker of inflammatory bowel disease activity: a systematic review.,"background: evidence indicates that inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is associated with increased systemic levels of reactive oxygen species. systemic oxidative stress has been associated with reduced levels of plasma thiols. less invasive tests capable of reflecting and predicting ibd activity are increasingly sought after. we sought to systematically review the evidence inherent in serum thiol levels as a marker of crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis activity (prospero: crd42021255521).
methods: the highest quality documents for systematic reviews standards were used as reference. articles were searched on medline via pubmed, vhl, lilacs, wos, embase, scopus, cochrane, cinahl, ovid, ctgov, who/ictrp, opengrey, bdtd and capes, between august, 03 and september, 03 on 2021. descriptors were defined according to the medical subject heading. of the 11 articles selected for full reading, 8 were included in the review. it was not possible to perform a pooled analysis of the studies, as there were no combinable studies between subjects with active ibd and controls/inactive disease.
results: findings from the individual studies included in this review suggest an association between disease activity and systemic oxidation, as measured by serum thiol levels, however, there are limitations that preclude weighting the study results in a meta-analysis.
conclusions: we recommend conducting better-designed and controlled studies, that include individuals of both phenotypes and at different stages of ibd, involving a larger number of participants, using the standardization of the technique for measuring serum thiols, to confirm whether thiols can be a good parameter for monitoring the clinical course of these intestinal diseases and the degree of clinical applicability.",Passos RA; Costa PRF; da Maia Lima CF; Santana GMS; David V; de Jesus Santos G; Zaltman C; Soares-Mota M; Rocha R,2023,BMC gastroenterology,23,1,94,10.1186/s12876-023-02711-9,"Passos, R.

37868553,biofilm's impact on inflammatory bowel diseases.,"the colon has a large surface area covered with a thick mucus coating. colon's biomass consists of about 1,012 colony-forming units per gram of feces and 500-1,000 distinct bacterial species. the term inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) indicates the collection of intestinal illnesses in which the digestive system (esophagus, large intestine, mouth, stomach, and small intestine) experiences persistent inflammation. ibd development is influenced by environmental (infections, stress, and nutrition) and genetic factors. the microbes present in gut microbiota help maintain intestinal homeostasis and support immune and epithelial cell growth, differentiation, as well as proliferation. it has been discovered that a variety of variables and microorganisms are crucial for the development of biofilms and mucosal colonization during ibd. an extracellular matrix formed by bacteria supports biofilm production in our digestive system and harms the host's immunological response. irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and ibd considerably affect human socioeconomic well-being and the standard of living. ibd is a serious public health issue, affecting millions of people across the globe. the gut microbiome may significantly influence ibs pathogenesis, even though few diagnostic and treatment options are available. as a result, current research focuses more on disrupting biofilm in ibd patients and stresses primarily on drugs that help improve the quality of life for human well-being. we evaluate studies on ibd and bacterial biofilm to add fresh insights into the existing state of knowledge of biofilm formation in ibd, incidence of ibd patients, molecular level of investigations, bacteria that are involved in the formation of biofilm, and present and down the line regimens and probiotics. planning advanced ways to control and eradicate bacteria in biofilms should be the primary goal to add fresh insights into generating innovative diagnostic and alternative therapy options for ibd.",Palandurkar GS; Kumar S,2023,Cureus,15,9,e45510,10.7759/cureus.45510,"Palandurkar, G.

methods: we searched medline, embase classic and embase, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials (through june 2021) to identify rcts comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adults with ibs-c or ibs-d. we generated forest plots of pooled adverse event rates in both active drug and placebo arms and pooled risk differences (rds) with 95% confidence intervals (cis).
key results: there were 21 rcts of licensed drugs versus placebo in ibs-c (5953 patients placebo) and 17 in ibs-d (3854 patients placebo). overall, 34.9% and 46.9% of placebo patients in ibs-c and ibs-d trials, respectively, developed at least one adverse event, with a statistically significantly higher risk of any adverse event and withdrawal due to an adverse event with active drug. in ibs-c and ibs-d trials, rates of each individual adverse event were generally higher with active drug. however, in ibs-c trials, only diarrhea or headache was significantly more common with active drug (rd 0.066 (95% ci 0.043-0.088) and rd 0.011 (95% ci 0.002-0.021), respectively), and in ibs-d trials only constipation, nausea, or abdominal pain (rd 0.096 (95% ci 0.054-0.138), 0.014 (95% ci 0.002-0.027), and 0.018 (95% ci 0.002-0.034), respectively).
conclusions & inferences: patients with ibs randomized to placebo have a high risk of reporting adverse events, which might relate to both nocebo and non-nocebo factors. although patients' expectations and psychosocial factors may be involved, further understanding of the mechanisms are important to control or optimize these effects in rcts, as well as in clinical practice.",Barberio B; Savarino EV; Black CJ; Ford AC,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,6,e14279,10.1111/nmo.14279,"Barberio, B., Savarino, E.

32801010,the risk of extraintestinal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies.,"background & aims: patients with crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) are at increased risk of developing intestinal cancer. however, less is known about the risk of extraintestinal cancers (eics). the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohorts assessing the risk of eics in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients.
methods: only population-based studies reporting on the prevalence or incidence of eics were included. in total, 884 studies were screened and those included were assessed for quality. eligible studies were pooled for length of follow-up evaluation, events in the ibd population, and events or expected events in a control population for the meta-analyses.
results: in total, 40 studies were included in the systematic review and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. the overall risk of eics was found to be increased in both cd (incidence rate ratio [irr]: 1.43 [ci, 1.26, 1.63]) and uc (irr: 1.15 [1.02, 1.31]) patients. both cd and uc patients presented with an increased risk of skin (irr: cd, 2.22 [1.41-3.48]; uc, 1.38 [1.12-1.71]) and hepatobiliary (irr: cd, 2.31 [1.25-4.28]; uc, 2.05 [1.52-2.76]) malignancies. furthermore, cd patients showed an increased risk of hematologic (irr, 2.40 [1.81-3.18]) and lung (irr, 1.53 [1.23-1.91]) cancers. these increased risks were present despite treatment with immunosuppressives.

38199885,acupuncture and moxibustion for irritable bowel syndrome: an umbrella systematic review.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a functional bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. several clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion for ibs. many systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for ibs have been published in recent years, but their results are not entirely consistent.
objective: to evaluate the methodological, reporting, and evidence quality of systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for ibs.
search strategy: systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for ibs published before february 20, 2023 were searched in eight databases: pubmed, embase, cochrane library, web of science, china national knowledge infrastructure, wanfang data, vip database for chinese technical periodicals, and china biology medicine. the keywords used for literature search were acupuncture, moxibustion, systematic review, meta-analysis, and irritable bowel syndrome.
inclusion criteria: systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture and moxibustion for ibs were included.
data extraction and analysis: relevant information was independently extracted by two investigators. the a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews 2 (amstar 2), preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma 2020), and grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (grade) were used to evaluate the methodological quality, reporting quality and evidence quality, respectively.
results: a total of 342 studies were retrieved and 15 systematic reviews were included. the results of amstar 2 showed low methodological quality in 2 studies and very low methodological quality in the remaining 13 studies, with main issues being failure to register a protocol, incomplete search strategy, not providing a list of excluded studies, incomplete consideration of the risk of bias in the included studies, and a failure to assess the publication bias. the results of prisma 2020 showed seriously deficient reporting quality of 2 studies, somewhat deficient reporting quality of 12 studies, and relatively complete reporting quality of 1 study, with the main problems being lack of a complete search strategy, non-availability of a list of excluded studies with justification for their exclusion, not conducting heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses, not evaluating the credibility of the evidence, and not registering the protocol. the results of grade showed that the quality of the evidence is low or very low.
conclusion: most included systematic reviews interpreted findings to suggest that acupuncture and moxibustion have benefits for ibs. however, there is a need to improve the methodological, reporting and evidence quality of the systematic reviews. larger, multicenter, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials and high-quality systematic reviews are required to obtain more robust evidence.

34752585,coping strategies and irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review.,"background and aims: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities. while psychosocial determinants were intently studied, coping strategies with stress used by ibs patients were never comprehensively reviewed. therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize the coping strategies used by ibs patients and to identify which tools are frequently used to measure coping strategies.
methods: according to prisma guidelines, we searched for articles indexed in pubmed, ebscohost, embase and cochrane library. the search terms included: (coping or coping strategies or coping mechanism) and (irritable bowel syndrome or ibs). the initial search identified 756 articles. after applying all filters (human filters, excluding conference abstracts and conference papers), 96 studies remained. finally, a total of 21 articles were included in this systematic review.
results: twenty-one articles using fifteen coping instruments and six measures of quality of life were found. one was interventional, one longitudinal, and the rest were cross-sectional studies. one study was qualitative, while the rest used quantitative measures. emotion-focused coping was associated with worse psychological outcomes, while the effect of problem-focused coping was not regularly associated with better psychological outcomes. catastrophizing was negatively associated with health-related quality of life. psychological distress (anxiety, depression) was significantly related to the impairment of health-related quality of life.
conclusion: patients with ibs cope in different ways when confronted with health and daily-life stressors. the maladaptive strategy of coping is associated with poor health-related quality of life and psychiatric comorbidities but methodological problems limit conclusions regarding the strength and nature of this association. future research needs to focus on which strategies are most effective at reducing psychological distress in ibs patients.",David L; Fadgyas Stanculete M; Bolba AR; Chiaroni G; Barsan M; Popa SL,2021,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,30,4,485-494,10.15403/jgld-3937,"David, L., Fadgyas Stanculete, M., Bolba, A.

methods: we searched pubmed and embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and covid-19, novel coronavirus and sars-cov-2. we included studies reporting the frequency of covid-19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. we estimated the pooled incidence of covid-19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis-a-vis the general population. we also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease.
results: twenty-four studies were included. the pooled incidence rate of covid-19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval [ci, 1.44-11.17]) and 6.59 [3.25-13.35], respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18-1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. the relative risk of the acquisition of covid-19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62-1.71). the pooled proportion of covid-19-positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. the risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to crohn's disease. the relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19-0.61; 0.49, 0.33-0.72 and 0.22, 0.13-0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64-2.40; 3.41, 2.28-5.11 and 2.70, 1.61-4.55) or 5-aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39-1.82; 2.38, 1.26-4.48 and 2.62, 1.67-4.11) use.

36821458,probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: review of mechanisms and effectiveness.,"purpose of review: the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and has been linked with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). the aim of this article is to critically review the emerging evidence for the mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these conditions.
recent findings: the gi microbiome is strongly influenced by ageing, diet and disease. probiotics may confer health effects to the host by modulating the metabolic activities of the microbiome to propagate anti-inflammatory effects and reinforce the intestinal barrier, and are considered to be safe to use. many short-term studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of probiotics overall in ibs, with meta-analyses demonstrating efficacy across specific strains albeit with relatively small effect sizes. within ibd, some probiotics appear to offer clinical benefit in ulcerative colitis but strain-specific effects are unclear. evidence for the use of probiotics in crohn's disease remains limited.
summary: probiotics offer considerable potential for the management of ibs and possibly in ibd, however, any benefits conferred appear to be strain-specific. high quality trials of specific probiotics in ibs and ibd, as well as laboratory investigations of their mechanism of action, are required in order to fully understand their potential therapeutic value.",So D; Quigley EMM; Whelan K,2023,Current opinion in gastroenterology,39,2,103-109,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000902,"So, D., Quigley, E.

35905421,risk of cervical cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis of population-based studies.,"introduction: there is increased risk of several malignancies in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, evidence regarding risk of cervical cancer in ibd is conflicting. we aimed to investigate the risk of cervical cancer in ibd by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis of unselected, population-based studies.
methods: medline, embase, and cochrane library were searched using medical subject heading terms, and 2 reviewers independently screened results. pooled hazard ratios (hrs) were calculated using random effects model meta-analysis for risk of cervical cancer in ibd. subgroup meta-analysis was undertaken to assess risk of cervical cancer by ibd subtype (crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), treatment exposure, and grade of lesion.
results: we screened 1,393 articles to identify 5 population-based studies, including 74,310 patients with ibd and 2,029,087 reference patients, across 5 different countries. pooled random effects model meta-analysis of these studies did not show statistically significant increased risk for cervical cancer in ibd compared with reference populations (hr: 1.24; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.94-1.63). meta-analysis by grade of lesion showed increased risk of low-grade cervical lesions (hr: 1.15; 95% ci: 1.04-1.28). meta-analysis by disease subtype indicated no statistically significant increased risk in crohn's disease (hr: 1.36; 95% ci: 0.83-2.23) or ulcerative colitis (hr: 0.95; 95% ci: 0.72-1.25) or in patients treated with antitumor necrosis factor (hr: 1.19; 95% ci: 0.64-2.21) or thiopurines (hr: 0.96; 95% ci: 0.60-1.50).

32236745,"rectal stump management in inflammatory bowel disease: a cohort study, systematic review and proportional analysis of perioperative complications.","background: the aim of this study was to analyse local single-institution data and perform a systematic review of the literature to calculate precise risk estimates of rectal stump-related morbidity and mortality following subtotal colectomy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including crohn's colitis, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis.
methods: institutional information systems were interrogated to obtain local patient data. a systematic review of medline and embase was performed to identify relevant articles. fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was performed to calculate pooled incidence estimates, including local data.
results: sixty-one patients were included locally and all had their rectal stump closed intra-abdominally. four patients (8.3%) had a rectal stump perforation and 30-day mortality was 0. fourteen papers were included in our review alongside local data, with a total of 1330 patients included. pooled mortality was 1.7% (95% confidence interval, ci 1.0-2.8), pooled incidence of pelvic abscess/sepsis, stump leak and wound infection was 5.7% (95% ci 4.4-7.3), 4.9% (95% ci 3.7-6.6) and 11.3% (95% ci 7.8-16), respectively. subcutaneous placement of the stump was associated with the highest incidence of stump leak (12.6%, 95% ci 8.3-18.6), and closure of the stump with both staples and suture was associated with the highest incidence of pelvic abscess (11.1%, 95% ci 5.8-20.3). mortality and the incidence of wound infection were similar across stump closure techniques. there was evidence suggesting considerable heterogeneity and publication bias among studies.
conclusions: this study provides estimates of morbidity associated with the rectal stump after subtotal colectomy for ibd. a closed intra-abdominal stump seems to be associated with the highest rate of pelvic abscess/sepsis. further work in form of an international collaborative project would allow individual patient data analysis and identification of risk factors for complications.",Lawday S; Leaning M; Flannery O; Summers S; Antoniou GA; Goodhand J; Bethune R; Antoniou SA,2020,Techniques in coloproctology,24,7,671-684,10.1007/s10151-020-02188-8,"Lawday, S., Leaning, M., Flannery, O., Summers, S., Antoniou, G.

38479936,efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common gastrointestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, distension, and altered bowel habits. probiotics may alleviate ibs symptoms, but clinical trials remain conflicting.
aims: to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for ibs patients.
methods: we searched relevant trials in pubmed, web of science, embase, cochrane library, and google scholar from 2000 to june 2023. standardized mean difference (smd) and 95% confidence interval (ci) were calculated for continuous outcomes. a risk ratio (rr) and a 95% ci were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.
results: a total of 20 studies involving 3011 patients were obtained. the results demonstrated that probiotics are more effective than placebo in reducing global ibs symptoms improvement rate (rr = 1.401, 95% ci 1.182-1.662, p < 0.001) and quality of life scores (smd = 0.286, 95% ci = 0.154-0.418, p < 0.001). subgroup analyses showed that a shorter treatment time (less than eight weeks) could reduce distension scores (smd = 0.197, 95% ci = 0.038-0.356, p = 0.015). high doses (daily dose of probiotics ≥ 10ˆ10) or multiple strains of probiotics exhibit beneficial effects on abdominal pain (smd = 0.412, 95% ci = 0.112-0.711, p = 0.007; smd = 0.590, 95% ci = 0.050-1.129, p = 0.032; respectively). however, there was no significant benefit on global symptom scores (smd = 0.387, 95% ci 0.122 to 0.653, p = 0.004) with statistically high inter-study heterogeneity (i2 = 91.9%, p < 0.001). furthermore, there was no significant inter-group difference in terms of adverse events frequency (rr = 0.997, 95% ci 0.845-1.177, p = 0.973).

37897138,a systematic review and meta-analysis of diet and nutrient intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome.,"background: numerous individual and environmental factors including diet may play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). it is unclear to what degree dietary intake is affected in individuals with ibs. we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize dietary intake of adults with ibs and to compare dietary intake between adults with ibs and non-ibs controls.
methods: ovid medline, embase, cochrane, cinahl, and scopus were searched through february 2023 for clinical trials and observational studies measuring usual diet in adults with ibs. pooled weighted averages were estimated for total energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient data. mean differences (md) in nutrient intake were estimated for adults with ibs versus non-ibs controls using a random effects model. heterogeneity was assessed by the inconsistency index (i2).
key results: sixty-three full-text articles were included in the review of which 29 studies included both ibs and control subjects. nutrients not meeting the recommended intake level for any dietary reference values in the ibs population were fiber and vitamin d. meta-regression by female proportion was positively correlated with total fat intake and negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake. comparisons between participants with ibs and controls showed significantly lower fiber intake in participants with ibs with high heterogeneity (md: -1.8; 95% ci: -3.0, -0.6; i2 = 85%).
conclusions and inferences: this review suggests that fiber and vitamin d intake is suboptimal in ibs; however, overall dietary intake does not appear to be comprised. causes and consequences of reduced fiber in ibs deserve further study. results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that fiber and vitamin d intake is suboptimal in ibs. however, overall intake of other macro- and micronutrients does not appear to be compromised. causes and consequences of reduced fiber and vitamin d intake in ibs deserve further study.",Veraza DI; Calderon G; Jansson-Knodell C; Aljaras R; Foster ED; Xu H; Biruete A; Shin A,2024,Neurogastroenterology and motility,36,1,e14698,10.1111/nmo.14698,"Veraza, D.

32047894,risk of postoperative infectious complications from medical therapies in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"objective: to assess the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery.
methods: we searched multiple electronic databases and reference lists of articles dating up to august 2018 for prospective and retrospective studies comparing postoperative infection risk in patients treated with an ibd medication perioperatively with the risk in patients who were not taking that medication. outcomes were overall infectious complications and intra-abdominal infections within 30 days of surgery.
results: sixty-three studies were included. overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) agents (odds ratio [or] 1.26; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.07-1.50) and corticosteroids (or 1.34; 95% ci, 1.25-1.44) and decreased in those who received 5-aminosalicylic acid (or 0.63; 95% ci, 0.46-0.87). no difference was observed in those treated with immunomodulators (or 1.08; 95% ci, 0.94-1.25) or anti-integrin agents (or 1.06; 95% ci, 0.67-1.69). both corticosteroids and anti-tnf agents were associated with increased intra-abdominal infection risk (or 1.63; 95% ci, 1.33-2.00 and or 1.46; 95% ci, 1.08-1.97, respectively), whereas no impact was observed with 5-aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, or anti-integrin therapy. twenty-two studies had low risk of bias while the remaining studies had very high risk.
conclusions: corticosteroids and anti-tnf agents were associated with increased overall postoperative infection risk as well as intra-abdominal infection in ibd patients, whereas no increased risk was observed for immunomodulators or anti-integrin therapy. although these results may result from residual confounding rather than from a true biological effect, prospective studies that control for potential confounding factors are required to generate higher-quality evidence.",Law CCY; Koh D; Bao Y; Jairath V; Narula N,2020,Inflammatory bowel diseases,26,12,1796-1807,10.1093/ibd/izaa020,"Law, C.

methods: we searched medline, embase and the cochrane library to identify articles comparing pregnancy outcomes between active and inactive ibd at the time of conception or during pregnancy. a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to pool estimates and report odds ratios [ors].
results: a total of 28 studies were identified as eligible for the meta-analysis. in women with active ibd, the pooled ors for low birth weight [lbw], preterm birth, small for gestational age [sga], spontaneous abortion and stillbirths were respectively 3.81 (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.81-8.02), 2.42 [95% ci 1.74-3.35], 1.48 [95% ci 1.19-1.85], 1.87 [95% ci 1.17-3.0] and 2.27 [95% ci 1.03-5.04] compared to women with inactive ibd. in the subgroup analysis based on disease type, women with active ulcerative colitis had an increased risk of lbw, preterm birth and spontaneous abortion. women with active crohn's disease had a higher risk of preterm birth, sga and spontaneous abortion.

33167889,the effects of resistant starches on inflammatory bowel disease in preclinical and clinical settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a debilitating chronic disease with limited treatment options. resistant starches may represent a novel treatment for ibd. however, its efficacy and safety remain unclear. our objective was to perform a systematic review to summarize the preclinical and clinical effects of resistant starch, which may help guide future studies.
methods: medline, embase, and the cochrane central register were searched. included studies investigated the use of resistant starch therapy in in vivo animal models of ibd or human patients with ibd. articles were screened, and data extracted, independently and in duplicate. the primary outcomes were clinical remission (clinical) and bowel mucosal damage (preclinical).
results: 21 preclinical (n = 989 animals) and seven clinical (n = 164 patients) studies met eligibility. preclinically, resistant starch was associated with a significant reduction in bowel mucosal damage compared to placebo (standardized mean difference - 1.83, 95% ci - 2.45 to - 1.20). clinically, five studies reported data on clinical remission but clinical and methodological heterogeneity precluded pooling. in all five, a positive effect was seen in patients who consumed resistant starch supplemented diets. the majority of studies in both the preclinical and clinical settings were at a high or unclear risk of bias due to poor methodological reporting.
conclusions: our review demonstrates that resistant starch is associated with reduced histology damage in animal studies, and improvements in clinical remission in ibd patients. these results need to be tempered by the risk of bias of included studies. rigorously designed preclinical and clinical studies are warranted. trial registration the review protocols were registered on prospero (preclinical: crd42019130896; clinical: crd42019129513).",Montroy J; Berjawi R; Lalu MM; Podolsky E; Peixoto C; Sahin L; Stintzi A; Mack D; Fergusson DA,2020,BMC gastroenterology,20,1,372,10.1186/s12876-020-01516-4,"Montroy, J., Berjawi, R., Lalu, M.

39777150,meta-analysis of gut microbiota alterations in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"introduction: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common chronic disorder of gastrointestinal function with a high prevalence worldwide. due to its complex pathogenesis and heterogeneity, there is urrently no consensus in ibs research.
methods: we collected and uniformly reanalyzed 1167 fecal 16s rrna gene sequencing samples (623 from ibs patients and 544 from healthy subjects) from 9 studies. using both a random effects (re) model and a fixed effects (fe) model, we calculated the odds ratios for metrics including bacterial alpha diversity, beta diversity, common genera and pathways between the ibs and control groups.
results: significantly lower alpha-diversity indexes were observed in ibs patients by random effects model. twenty-six bacterial genera and twelve predicted pathways were identified with significant odds ratios and classification potentials for ibs patients. based on these feature, we used transfer learning to enhance the predictive capabilities of our model, which improved model performance by approximately 10%. moreover, through correlation network analysis, we found that ruminococcaceae and christensenellaceae were negatively correlated with vitamin b6 metabolism, which was decreased in the patients with ibs. ruminococcaceae was also negatively correlated with tyrosine metabolism, which was decreased in the patients with ibs.

37222050,association between helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) negatively affect the quality of life. some previous studies found that h. pylori infection should be positively associated with the risk of ibs, but others did not. the present study aims to clarify this association, and to further analyse whether h. pylori treatment can improve ibs symptoms.
materials and methods: the pubmed, embase, cochrane library, chinese national knowledge infrastructure, china science and technology journal and wanfang databases were searched. meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model. the pooled odds ratios (ors)/risk ratios (rrs) and their 95% cis were calculated. heterogeneity was evaluated using the cochran's q test and i2 statistics. meta-regression analysis was used to explore the sources of heterogeneity.
results: thirty-one studies with 21 867 individuals were included. meta-analysis of 27 studies found that patients with ibs had a significantly higher risk of h. pylori infection than those without (or = 1.68, 95% ci 1.29 to 2.18; p < 0.001). the heterogeneity was statistically significant (i2 = 85%; p < 0.001). meta-regression analyses indicated that study design and diagnostic criteria of ibs might be the potential sources of heterogeneity. meta-analysis of eight studies demonstrated that h. pylori eradication treatment had a higher improvement rate of ibs symptoms (rr = 1.24, 95% ci 1.10 to 1.39; p < 0.001). the heterogeneity was not significant (i2 = 32%; p = 0.170). meta-analysis of four studies also demonstrated that successful h. pylori eradication had a higher improvement rate of ibs symptoms (rr = 1.25, 95% ci 1.01 to 1.53; p = 0.040). the heterogeneity was not significant (i2 = 1%; p = 0.390).

38128150,effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: internet-based telerehabilitation could be a valuable option for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, with the advantage of providing rehabilitation from anywhere. however, there is no solid and updated evidence demonstrating its effectiveness on relevant clinical and cost outcomes.
objective: this systematic review aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of internet-based telerehabilitation during the recovery of musculoskeletal disorders.
methods: medline, web of science, scopus and cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception to june 2023. trials investigating the effects of internet-based telerehabilitation in any musculoskeletal disorder were selected. nonoriginal articles and grey literature were excluded. two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction. random effect meta-analyses (standardized mean difference) and further sensitivity analyses were performed.
results: we selected 37 clinical trials (33 randomized and 4 non-randomized) and 5 health economics studies, which included a total of 4,288 participants. telerehabilitation was more favourable than control treatments in improving all studied clinical outcomes, although the effectiveness varied depending on the type of musculoskeletal disorder. the standard mean differences (smd) ranged from 0.24 to 0.91. for physical function, the primary outcome, superior effectiveness was found only in people with hip fractures (smd, 0.87; 95 % ci, 0.34 to 1.41). the effects for joint replacement, osteoarthritis, and spine pain were similar to those of control treatments. however, the favourable outcomes for telerehabilitation became insignificant when compared specifically to face-to-face rehabilitation. some results displayed publication bias and a lack of robustness, necessitating cautious interpretation. in terms of health economics studies, telerehabilitation was 89.55$ (95 % ci 4.6 to 174.5) cheaper per individual than conventional treatments.
conclusions: telerehabilitation should be considered in the recovery process of musculoskeletal disorders when optimal face-to-face rehabilitation is not feasible. moreover, telerehabilitation reduces costs and time.

32738908,assessment of causal link between psychological factors and symptom exacerbation in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review utilising bradford hill criteria and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,"background: psychological stress is a prevalent factor in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) with detrimental effects on patients' quality of life and possibly disease course. although the aetiology of symptom exacerbation in ibd has been explored, determining any causation between psychological stress and symptom worsening remains challenging and requires a methodologically rigorous approach.
aim: the aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to determine a causal relationship between psychological stress and symptom exacerbation in ibd, subsequently utilising bradford hill's criteria (approach never used in this topic area before) to evaluate the likelihood of causal associations.
methods: medline, embase, cinahl and psycinfo were searched for relevant studies up to july 20, 2019. data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by two independent reviewers. results of all retained papers were presented as a narrative synthesis. a random-effect meta-analysis was conducted on studies meeting the criteria for meta-analysis. bradford hill criteria were applied to assess the causality of the relationship between all psychological factors and symptom exacerbation.
results: the searches yielded 2472 potential articles. nineteen clinical prospective cohort studies were eligible for the narrative review with five suitable for the meta-analysis. meta-analysis showed depression, anxiety and perceived stress did not have a statistically significant association with an increased risk of symptom exacerbation. four of the bradford hill criteria were met which indicates that there is weak to moderate evidence of a causal association between all the psychological factors and disease activity. inconsistent results and a dearth of studies using the same tools for measuring psychological factors suggest the need for more research to be done to facilitate more conclusive findings.
conclusions: this original review utilising bradford hill criteria in addition to meta-analysis to evaluate the causality of relationship between psychological factors and symptom exacerbation in ibd provides evidence that psychological factors have a weak to moderate causal involvement in ibd symptom exacerbation. however, when combining this finding with the outcomes of the meta-analysis, we can say that the results were inconclusive. interventions to reduce the associated psychological impact should be part of the treatment plan for patients with ibd.

38762503,medical radiation exposure in inflammatory bowel disease: an updated meta-analysis.,"background: there have been previous studies and earlier systematic review on the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and radiation exposure. with the diversification of current test methods, this study intended to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the ibd radiation exposure in recent years.
methods: three databases (pubmed, embase, and medicine) for relevant literature up to may 1, 2023 were searched. the statistical data meeting requirements were collated and extracted.
results: 20 papers were enrolled. the overall high radiation exposure rate was 15% (95% ci = [12%, 19%]) for cd and 5% (95% ci = [3%, 7%]) for uc. the pooled result found that high radiation exposure rate was 3.44 times higher in cd than in uc (or = 3.44, 95% ci = [2.35, 5.02]). moreover, the average radiation exposure level in cd was 12.77 msv higher than that in uc (wmd = 12.77, 95% ci = [9.93, 15.62] msv). furthermore, radiation exposure level of cd after 2012 was higher than those before 2012 (26.42 ± 39.61vs. 23.76 ± 38.46 msv, p = 0.016), while uc did not show similar result (11.99 ± 27.66 vs. 10.01 ± 30.76 msv, p = 0.1). through subgroup analysis, it was found that disease duration (wmd = 2.75, 95% ci = [0.10, 5.40] msv), complications (or = 5.09, 95% ci = [1.50, 17.29]), and surgical history (or = 5.46, 95% ci = [1.51, 19.69]) significantly increased the proportion of high radiation exposure.

methods: this systematic review searched cinahl, cochrane library, conference citation index, embase, pubmed, psycarticles, psychinfo, science citation index-expanded, social science citation index. titles and abstracts, then full-text articles were screened against inclusion criteria: trials with a concurrent comparator of hypnotherapy in adults with ibs diagnosed using manning or rome criteria, which provided symptom data. included studies were extracted and assessed for bias using cochrane collaboration 2011 guidance. random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with sub-group analysis to assess the impact of delivery characteristics on outcomes.
results: twelve trials were included, 7 in the meta-analyses. hypnotherapy reduced the risk of ggs, but this was not statistically significant, (standardised mean difference (smd) 0.24, [-0.06, 0.54], i2 66 %). higher frequency of sessions (≥1/week) reduced ggs (smd 0.45 [0.23,0.67] i2 0 %), as did higher volumes of intervention (≥8 sessions with ≥6 h of contact) (smd 0.51 [0.27,0.76] i2 0 %) and group interventions (smd 0.45 [0.03, 0.88] i2 62 %). only volume of intervention produced a significant effect between the subgroups.

32317962,efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disease. evidence has suggested that probiotics may benefit ibs symptoms. however, clinical trials remain conflicting.
aims: to implement a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials regarding the efficacy and safety of probiotics for ibs patients.
methods: we searched for relevant trials in medline(1966 to jan 2019), embase(1974 to jan 2019), the cochrane central register of controlled trials(up to jan 2019), the clinicaltrials.gov trials register(up to jan 2019), and chinese biomedical literature database(1978 to jan 2019). risk ratio (rr) and a 95% confidence interval (ci) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. standardized mean difference (smd) and 95% ci were calculated for continuous outcomes.
results: a total of 59 studies, including 6,761 patients, were obtained. the rr of the improvement or response with probiotics versus placebo was 1.52 (95% ci 1.32-1.76), with significant heterogeneity (i2 = 71%, p < 0.001). the smd of probiotics in improving global ibs symptoms vs. placebo was -1.8(95% ci -0.30 to -0.06), with significant heterogeneity (i2 = 65%, p < 0.001). it was impossible to draw a determinate conclusion. however, there were differences in subgroup analyses of probiotics type, dose, treatment duration, and geographic position. probiotics seem to be safe by the analysis of adverse events(rr = 1.07; 95% ci 0.92-1.24; i2 = 0, p = 0.83).

38915086,"impact of sex and socioeconomic status on the likelihood of surgery, hospitalization, and use of medications in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","background: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) are associated with high healthcare utilization. this systematic review aimed to summarize what is known about the impact of sex, income, and education on the likelihood of bowel surgery, hospitalization, and use of corticosteroids and biologics among patients with ibd.
methods: we used embase, medline, cinahl, and web of science to perform a systematic literature search. pooled hazard ratios (hrs) and odds ratios (ors) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated using random effects meta-analysis for the impact of sex on the likelihood of surgery and hospitalization. in addition, we performed subgroup analyses of the effect of ibd type (crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and age. finally, meta-regression was undertaken for the year of publication.
results: in total, 67 studies were included, of which 23 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. in the main meta-analysis, male sex was associated with an increased likelihood of bowel surgery (hr 1.42 (95% ci 1.13;1.78), which was consistent with the subgroup analysis for uc only (hr 1.78, 95% ci 1.16; 2.72). sex did not impact the likelihood of hospitalization (or 1.05 (95% ci 0.86;1.30), although the subgroup analysis revealed an increased likelihood of hospitalization in cd patients (or 1.42, 95% ci 1.28;1.58). in 9 of 10 studies, no significant sex-based differences in the use of biologics were reported, although in 6 of 6 studies, female patients had lower adherence to biologics. in 11 of 13 studies, no significant sex-based difference in the use of corticosteroids was reported. the evidence of the impact of income and education on healthcare utilization was sparse and pointed in different directions. the substantial heterogeneity between studies was explained, in part, by differences in ibd type and age.
conclusions: the results of this systematic review indicate that male patients with ibd are significantly more likely to have surgery than female patients with ibd but are not, overall, more likely to be hospitalized, whereas female patients appear to have statistically significantly lower adherence to biologics compared to male patients. thus, clinicians should not underestimate the impact of sex on healthcare utilization. evidence for income- and education-based differences remains sparse.

36013502,helicobacterpylori infection-a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome? an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"unlabelled: nowadays, the relationship between helicobacter pylori infection (hpi) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) remains controversial.
objective: the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between hpi and ibs through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.
methods: we performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 august 2021. the odds ratio (or) and confidence interval (ci) were calculated to evaluate the association between hpi and ibs. subgroup analyses were conducted for further assessment and exploration of heterogeneity sources. in addition, we assessed publication bias through funnel plots, egger's test, and begg's test. finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results.
results: thirteen studies with 13,173 participants were included in the meta-analysis. the pooled or of the association between hpi and ibs was 1.03 (95% ci [0.80,1.31]; p = 0.84). the adjusted or of the association between hpi and ibs after excluding the studies with confounding factors defined by our team was 1.29 (95% ci [1.03,1.62]; p = 0.03). we found a positive association between hpi and ibs-d (diarrhea subtype) (or: 1.54; 95% ci [1.22,1.95]; p = 0.0003). the or of the relationship between cytotoxin-associated gene a (cag a) positive hpi and ibs was 4.3 (95% ci [0.51,36.17]; p = 0.18).
conclusions: the likelihood of hpi in ibs patients is relatively higher than that of non-ibs participants but not statistically significant, implying that hpi is not significantly associated with ibs, albeit we may underestimate this association. moreover, we found a positive association between hpi and ibs-d. we also observed an increased likelihood of cag-a positive hpi in ibs patients than that of non-ibs participants but not statistically significant.",Wang Z; Liu Y; Peng Y; Peng L,2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",58,8,,10.3390/medicina58081035,"Wang, Z., Liu, Y., Peng, Y., & Peng, L.

32530987,pharmacologic treatments for irritable bowel syndrome: an umbrella systematic review.,"background and aims: multiple pharmacologic treatments are available for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and a large body of evidence has been presented. however, the strength and credibility of the evidence have not been comprehensively evaluated. we aimed to review the systematic reviews and meta- analyses of pharmacologic treatments for ibs and evaluate the credibility of the findings.
methods: we searched medline, embase, and cochrane library from inception to september 2019 for systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for ibs. we summarized relative ratios (rr), evaluated the credibility of the evidence and classified the evidence into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, and weak.
results: we included 11 systematic reviews with 40 meta-analyses (330 randomized controlled trials and 86,459 participants) assessing 10 treatment categories and 2 drugs. most of the pharmacologic treatments were significantly superior over placebo as reported by the included meta-analyses. the evidence for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)3 antagonists (rr=1.56, 95%ci: 1.43-1.71), antispasmodics (rr=1.19, 95%ci: 1.02-1.39), and alosetron (rr=1.46, 95%ci: 1.26-1.71) were highly suggestive for relieving global ibs symptoms. 5-ht4 agonists (rr= 1.26, 95%ci: 1.19-1.34) and guanylate cyclase-c (gcc) agonists (rr=1.73, 95%ci: 1.54-1.95) were found to give convincing evidence for the improvement of the responder rate. 5-ht3 antagonists (rr=1.32, 95%ci: 1.26-1.38) offered convincing evidence for relieving abdominal pain.

methods: medline, embase, scopus, and web of science databases were searched for studies published before may 2022, not restricted by publication language or date. the methodological quality and risk of bias of primary-level studies were critically assessed. meta-analyses were performed, as well as meta-regression, stratified, sensitivity and small-study effects analyses, a galbraith (radial) plot, and trial sequential analysis. quality of evidence was evaluated using grade system.
results: 104 studies, including 16,587 patients, met the inclusion criteria. the results show that patients who suffer from olp have a high prevalence of hypertension (pp = 24.17%, 95% ci = 21.45-27.00), with a low quality of evidence. a significant association between hypertension and oral lichen planus was also reported (or = 1.28, 95% ci = 1.01-1.63, p = 0.04), showing a moderate quality of evidence.
conclusions: patients with olp could be at an increased risk of suffering from hypertension which is probably due to multiple factors. healthcare practitioners involved in olp management should be aware of this comorbidity in order to apply suitable measures and make referrals if hypertension is suspected, although further research is needed.",De Porras-Carrique T; Ramos-García P; González-Moles MÁ,2024,Oral diseases,30,4,1793-1805,10.1111/odi.14727,"De Porras-Carrique, T., Ramos-García, P., & González-Moles, M.

35879058,efficacy of a restrictive diet in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"background/aims: dietary factors can aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). many ibs patients try restrictive diets to relieve their symptoms, but the types of diets with an exacerbating factor are unknown. therefore, this paper reports the results of a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (rcts) reviewing the efficacy of food restriction diets in ibs.
methods: the medline, embase, cochrane central register of controlled trials, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched until july 21, 2021, to retrieve rcts assessing the efficacy of restriction diets in adults with ibs. two independent reviewers performed the eligibility assessment and data abstraction. rcts that evaluated a restriction diet versus a control diet and assessed the improvement in global ibs symptoms were included. these trials reported a dichotomous assessment of the overall response to therapy.
results: a total of 1,949 citations were identified. after full-text screening, 14 rcts were considered eligible for the systematic review and network meta-analysis. a starch- and sucrose-reduced diet and a diet with low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (fodmaps) showed significantly better results than a usual diet. symptom flare-ups in patients on a gluten- free diet were also significantly lower than in those on high-gluten diets.
conclusions: these findings showed that the starch- and sucrose-reduced, low fodmap, and gluten-free diets had superior effects in reducing ibs symptoms. further studies, including head-to-head trials will be needed to establish the effectiveness of dietary restrictions on ibs symptoms.",Yu SJ; Lee HS; Gung HJ; Kim JS; Kim KB; Kwon YH; Kim JH; Koo HS; Shin HD; Jee SR; Lee HB; Kim J; Park HW,2022,The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi,80,1,6-16,10.4166/kjg.2022.014,"Yu, S.

31898645,efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background/aim: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common chronic functional bowel disorder and the evidence shows most drug therapies in the treatment of ibs are weak. recently, some studies showed probiotics may have a positive effect in ibs and they are widely used to improve the symptom of ibs, which indicate probiotics may play an important role in the treatment of ibs. however, the exact effectiveness and safety of probiotics are largely unknown. this systematic review focuses on identifying the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of ibs.
materials and methods: data sources were searched up to february 2019. databases included medline, central, cinahl, and embase. randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics including complex or individual probiotics with placebo or no therapy were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers. the data were pooled using a random-effects model. the methodological quality of all rcts was assessed using the cochrane risk of bias and jadad scale. outcomes included symptom-relevant and patient-relevant characteristics, such as symptom relief, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, quality of life, and adverse event.
results: this review includes 28 studies with a total of 3606 participants. particular combinations of probiotics, or specific species and strains, showed probiotics have beneficial effect on overall ibs symptoms (22 studies, n = 3144, rr of improvement in overall ibs symptoms = 1.5, ci 1.23 to 1.83) or overall ibs symptom and abdominal pain scores (18 studies, n = 2766, smd = -0.31, ci -0.45 to -0.17). in addition, adverse events were not significantly higher with probiotics (8 studies, n = 923, rr = 1.05; 95% ci 0.85-1.31). however, there was no significant benefit on individual ibs symptom scores and quality of life.

methods: we searched ovid medline, embase and cochrane (until september 2020) for randomized controlled trials (rcts) recruiting patients with refractory ibs. we evaluated the definition of refractory ibs through the following aspects: duration of symptoms, unresponsive to dietary intervention, lifestyle modification, pharmacology, psychology, severity assessment and adequate explanation. the effect of the different definitions for refractory ibs on the therapeutic effect of gut-directed hypnotherapy (gdh) was checked by a meta-analysis.
results: twenty-one rcts were finally included. six (28.6%) out of 21 rcts recruited patients with symptoms lasting for over 12 months; 8 (38.1%) rcts reported a prior use of dietary intervention; 1 (4.8%) rct reported the use of lifestyle modification; 11 (52.4%) rcts recruited patients who were unresponsive to pharmacology; 2 (9.5%) rcts recruited patients with no response to psychological therapy ; 5 (23.8%) rcts had symptoms severity assessment; and 8 (38.1%) rcts recruited patients who were informed adequately. despite being tested in trials with heterogeneous definition of refractory ibs, gdh had similar effectiveness when compared with supportive treatment [standardized mean difference (smd)=-0.69, 95%ci: -0.93 to -0.44)] or waiting-list control (smd=-0.54, 95%ci: -0.98 to -0.10).

31624009,nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.,"the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and ibd has become a worldwide disease. epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. the change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of ibd. besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and ibd developed. as a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of ibd. carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. the undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. high fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. low fodmap is recommended in ibs and is also suggested in patients of ibd with ibs-like symptoms. specific carbohydrate diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. exclusive enteral nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric cd in many literatures. paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. these findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.",Hsieh MS; Hsu WH; Wang JW; Wang YK; Hu HM; Chang WK; Chen CY; Wu DC; Kuo FC; Su WW,2020,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,119,12,1742-1749,10.1016/j.jfma.2019.09.005,"Hsieh, M.

38553410,efficacy of probiotic supplementation and impact on fecal microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"unlabelled: context: research regarding the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) with probiotics has not yielded consistent results.
objective: the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in patients with ibd.
data sources: randomized controlled trials (rcts) evaluating the efficacy of probiotics in patients with ibd were searched in pubmed, the google scholar database, web of science, and crossref for the period july 2003 to june 2023.
data extraction: the rcts were extracted, independently by 2 authors, according to the picos criteria.
data analysis: seven studies, including a total of 795 patients, met the study criteria. five end points were selected to evaluate the efficacy. of these, 3 indicators showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy: c-reactive protein (odds ratio [or]: -2.45, 95% confidence interval [ci]: -3.16, -1.73, p < .01), the number of fecal bifidobacterium (or: 3.37, 95% ci: 3.28, 3.47, p < .01), and lactobacillus(or: 2.00, 95% ci: 1.91, 2.09, p < .01). the other 2 indicators (disease activity for crohn's disease and for ulcerative colitis) showed no statistically significant difference, while the or reflected a positive correlation.

method: a systematic review of the literature was performed using pubmed, embase and google scholar. a meta-analysis was then conducted using a random-effects model.
results: five studies were included in the systematic review. of the total patients, 26.5% had perianal crohn's disease. the median follow-up was 6 years. in total, 127 cases of colorectal cancer were found [0.43% of the included crohn's disease patients]. perianal involvement was present in 50% of colorectal cancer patients [0.89% of the population]. three of the studies specified the cancer to be rectal or anal, which were present in 68 and 24 cases [0.3% and 0.1% of patients], respectively. in a subgroup analysis of rectal and anal cancer, perianal involvement was most frequent in anal cancer, accounting for 46% of the cases. in the rectal cancer group, 37% had perianal involvement. the higher incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with perianal crohn's disease was confirmed in a meta-analysis.
conclusion: half of the patients with colorectal cancer and anal cancer were found to have perianal crohn's disease. in patients with perianal involvement, there was a higher percentage of anal cancer compared with rectal cancer. these results support the theory that patients with perianal crohn's disease are at increased risk for developing colorectal and anal cancer. studies collecting more detailed data regarding patients and their cancers are needed to further specify the disease course.",Johansen MP; Wewer MD; Nordholm-Carstensen A; Burisch J,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,3,361-368,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac143,"Johansen, M.

results: thirty-three trials were identified that met all eligibility criteria. seventeen of these evaluated peppermint essential oil, fifteen other western herbal medicines, and one trial evaluated peppermint oil in one arm and aniseed essential oil in the other arm. eighteen different herbal preparations were evaluated in these trials. data suggests that a number of western herbal medicines may provide relief of ibs symptoms. meta-analyses suggest that peppermint essential oil is both efficacious and well-tolerated in the short-term management of ibs. aloe vera and asafoetida also demonstrated efficacy in reducing global ibs symptoms in meta-analyses. the herbal formulas stw 5, stw 5-ii and carmint, along with ferula assa-foetida, pimpenella anisum oil, the combination of curcumin and foeniculum vulgare oil, and the blend of schinopsis lorentzii, aesculus hippocastanum, and peppermint essential oil also demonstrated efficacy in rigorously-designed clinical trials.
conclusion: a number of western herbal medicines show promise in the treatment of ibs. with the exception of peppermint essential oil, aloe vera, and asafoetida, however, none of the positive trials have been replicated. this lack of replication limits the capacity to make definitive statements of efficacy for these herbal medicines.",Hawrelak JA; Wohlmuth H; Pattinson M; Myers SP; Goldenberg JZ; Harnett J; Cooley K; Van De Venter C; Reid R; Whitten DL,2020,Complementary therapies in medicine,48,,102233,10.1016/j.ctim.2019.102233,"Hawrelak, J.

35509010,the efficacy of vitamin d supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder involving gut-brain interactions with limited effective treatment options. vitamin d deficiency is commonly observed in patients with ibs, but whether vitamin d supplementation ameliorates ibs is controversial in randomized controlled trials. the present systematic review and meta-analysis explored the efficacy of vitamin d supplementation in patients with ibs.
methods: we performed a systematic search of potentially relevant publications from pubmed, embase, the cochrane central register of controlled studies and the web of science up until january 2022. we assessed the weighted mean difference (wmd) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) of the ibs severity scoring system (ibs-sss), ibs quality of life (ibs-qol) and ibs total score (ibs-ts) before and after vitamin d supplementation intervention.
results: we included four randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving 335 participants. the differences in ibs-sss score between participants in the intervention group and the placebo group increased after intervention (wmd: -55.55, 95% ci: -70.22 to -40.87, i2 = 53.7%, after intervention; wmd: -3.17, 95% ci: -18.15 to 11.81, i2 = 0.0%, before intervention). participants receiving vitamin d supplementation showed greater improvement in ibs-sss after intervention than participants receiving placebo treatment (wmd: -84.21, 95% ci: -111.38 to -57.05, i2 = 73.2%; wmd: -28.29, 95% ci: -49.95 to -6.62, i2 = 46.6%, respectively). vitamin d supplementation was also superior to placebo in ibs-qol improvement (wmd: 14.98, 95% ci: 12.06 to 17.90, i2 = 0.0%; wmd: 6.55, 95% ci: -2.23 to 15.33, i2 = 82.7%, respectively). sensitivity analyses revealed an unstable pooled effect on ibs-ts in participants receiving vitamin d supplementation. therefore, we did not evaluate the efficacy of vitamin d intervention in ibs-ts.

objective: this study sought to investigate whether a lf-gfd would help patients with ibs.
methods: strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of lf-gfd in the treatment of ibs patients. using measurements including the visual analog scale (vas) for bloating and pain, the ibs symptom severity scale (ibs-sss), and ibs quality of life (ibs-qol), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of lf-gfd in reducing ibs symptoms. furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of lf-gfd utilizing the self- rating depression scale (sds) and self- rating anxiety scale (sas).
results: a total of 437 patients (221 on lf-gfd diet and 216 on gfd) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. the combined results indicated that lf-gfd reduced the vas bloating ratings (rr = - 0.58, 95%ci - 0.92-0.23, p = 0.0010, i2 = 83%) and the vas pain scores (rr = - 0.42, 95%ci - 0.66-0.19, p = 0.005, i2 = 58%). in addition, lf-gfd indicated a substantial enhancement in ibs-sss scores (md = - 1.42, 95%ci - 2.74-0.10, p = 0.03, i2 = 24%) and ibs-qol ratings (md = 3.75, 95%ci 0.98-6.53, p = 0.008, i2 = 33%). moreover, the lf-gfd group showed a substantial drop in sds (md = - 2.56, 95%ci - 3.38-1.74, p < 0.00001, i2 = 65%) and sas (md = - 4.30, 95%ci - 6.53-2.24, p < 0.0001, i2 = 0%) scores compared to the gfd group.

38877332,reactive immunomodulator addition to infliximab monotherapy restores clinical response in inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis.,"background and aims: patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) receiving infliximab (ifx) commonly experience immunogenic loss of response (lor) by formation of anti-drug antibodies (adas). an immunomodulator (imm) used in combination with initial ifx induction is known to reduce ada development and improve clinical outcomes. we aimed to assess the impact of reactively adding an imm to patients on ifx monotherapy.
methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study and systematic review with meta-analysis of patients with ibd demonstrating immunologic lor, with or without clinical lor, that had an imm (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) reactively added (reactive combination therapy; rct) to combat elevated adas and raise ifx level. data were extracted for pooled effect size estimation using random-effects models, and ada and ifx trough levels were compared pre- and post-imm initiation.
results: we identified 6 patients who received rct due to rising ada titers and low ifx levels. median ada titer decreased from 506 ng/ml (interquartile range (iqr) [416-750]) to 76.5 ng/ml (iqr [25.8-232]), an 85% decrease (p = 0.031). median ifx trough increased from 0.4 μg/ml (iqr [0.4-0.48]) to 8.25 μg/ml (iqr [3.7-9.6]), a 20.6-fold increase (p = 0.038). meta-analysis pooled effect size of 7 studies with 89 patients showed an 87% ada titer reduction [95% confidence interval (ci) = 72-94%], 6.7-fold increased ifx trough (95% ci = 2.4-18.7), and 76% clinical remission rescue rate (95% ci = 59-93%).

34486656,systematic review of the effects of oat intake on gastrointestinal health.,"background: oats are a food source with multiple health benefits that could support beneficial bacterial groups and provide important bioactive compounds for the gut.
objectives: this review explores the association between oat intake, gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms, and microbial community changes in individuals with celiac disease (ced), irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and without gi disease.
methods: four databases and google scholar were systematically searched from inception until april 29, 2021. clinical trials, observational studies, and in vitro studies with human gut-derived samples were included.
results: there were 84 articles [23 randomized controlled trials (rcts), 21 nonrandomized trials, 8 observational studies, and 32 in vitro studies] included. oat intake increased total bacterial count, lactobacilli spp., and bifidobacterium spp. in healthy individuals and those with ced. there was an increased concentration of short-chain fatty acids and improved gut permeability with oat intake but with no significant quality-of-life difference. in some individuals with ced, consumption of certain oat types was associated with worsening of gi symptoms. we found no studies reporting on ibs and only 3 for ibd. the quality of rcts showed some concerns mostly in domains of randomization (73.9%), whereas the quality of evidence of non-rcts, observational studies, and in vitro studies was satisfactory.
conclusions: oat intake was associated with the increase of beneficial bacterial groups in individuals without gi disease and those with ced. most studies showed no changes in gi symptoms with oat consumption. in vitro studies in ced provide insight to oat-sensitive individuals and their gi mucosa, but the clinical studies remain limited, precluding our ability to draw firm conclusions. the prevalence of oat sensitivity in individuals with ced should be further explored as this could improve clinical management and facilitate inclusion of oat in the diet for this population.",Valido E; Stoyanov J; Bertolo A; Hertig-Godeschalk A; Zeh RM; Flueck JL; Minder B; Stojic S; Metzger B; Bussler W; Muka T; Kern H; Glisic M,2021,The Journal of nutrition,151,10,3075-3090,10.1093/jn/nxab245,"Valido, E., Stoyanov, J., Bertolo, A., Hertig-Godeschalk, A., Zeh, R.

methods: we searched four databases for randomised controlled trials (rcts) that compared fmt with a control intervention in patients with ibs. the revised cochrane risk-of-bias (rob) tool was chosen for appraisal. meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (tsa) was conducted. grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation (grade) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence (coe).
results: we included 12 rcts with a total of 615 participants. meta-analyses showed no significant difference between the fmt and control groups in terms of clinical responses (relative risk [rr] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.88-2.33) and changes in ibs severity scoring system (ibs-sss) scores (standardised mean difference [smd] = - 0.31, 95% ci - 0.72 to 0.09) and ibs quality of life (ibs-qol) scores (smd = 0.30, 95% ci - 0.09 to 0.69). subgroup analysis revealed that in studies with low rob and using endoscopy, nasojejunal tube and rectal enema delivery, fmt led to a significant improvement in clinical responses and changes in ibs-sss and ibs-qol scores. tsa suggested that the current evidence is inconclusive and that the coe is very low.
conclusion: this study suggests that patients with ibs may benefit from fmt especially when it is administered via endoscopy, nasojejunal tube or rectal enema. however, the certainty of evidence is very low. further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of fmt for ibs treatment.

36443973,children and adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome: treatment and management.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a disorder that causes stomach pain in children and adolescents. it may also impact one's quality of life. ibs is linked to gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea and constipation. despite the identification of several potential pathophysiological pathways, the aetiology of ibs remained unknown.
objective: the aim of this paper is to discuss the diagnosis, pathogenesis, case studies and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in children and adolescents.
methods: this systematic review covered relevant papers from the previous ten years that were accessible in science direct, elsevier, ncbi, and web of science related to the pathophysiology and function of pharmacological drugs such as antidepressants, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and antibiotics in children with irritable bowel syndrome.
results: only a few prospective therapy techniques have been investigated in children, and even fewer of those have been demonstrated to be effective. this article presents case studies including 50-59 children, which demonstrate a favourable acceptable impact that is more effective than a placebo in terms of reducing symptoms and improving the overall quality of life in children who have irritable bowel syndrome. furthermore, the majority of the pathophysiological explanations and treatment options discussed are based on adult studies. these major issues arose when treating paediatric ibs, and they must be addressed in order to properly treat children with ibs. trials that focus on many combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies seem to be more helpful.
discussion: in recent years, a number of systematic reviews have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of medication treatments in children for ibs; however, the dependability of these systematic reviews needs to be further investigated owing to the various experimental designs and levels of evidence used. this article highlights paediatric therapy options, including pharmaceutical medications such as antidepressants, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and antibiotics. the goal is to alleviate ibs symptoms while also enhancing the quality of life for children with this illness.",Wal A; Wal P; Verma N; Pandey SS; Krishnan K; Bhowmick M,2024,Current pediatric reviews,20,2,166-177,10.2174/1573396319666221128094843,"Wal, A., Wal, P., Verma, N., Pandey, S.

40765115,effects of a low fodmap diet in inflammatory bowel disease and patient experiences: a mixed methods systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"introduction: a low fodmap diet reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), but its impact on inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is less established. this systematic review aimed to: (1) assess the effect of a low fodmap diet in ibd and (2) understand patient experiences when implementing the low fodmap diet.
methods: four databases (medline, embase, cinahl and central) were systematically searched. rcts evaluating a low fodmap diet in ibd on disease activity, inflammatory markers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life (qol), and qualitative studies reporting patient experiences of low fodmap interventions (in either ibs or ibd), were included. outcome data were meta-analysed as standardised mean differences or odds ratios. qualitative data underwent content analysis using the health belief model.
results: five rcts (n = 224) and two qualitative studies (n = 30 ibs patients, no studies in ibd) were included. compared with controls, there was no effect of a low fodmap diet on disease activity (crohn's disease: smd -0.33; -0.77, 0.11; ulcerative colitis: smd -0.31; -0.78, 0.15) or faecal calprotectin (smd -0.20; -0.49, 0.09), but lower severity of global ibs symptoms (smd -0.56; -0.90, 0.23) and higher qol scores (smd 0.43; 0.05, 0.81) at end of intervention. patients with ibs described implementation as burdensome (severity, barriers), inadequate professional support (susceptibility) and found it difficult to interpret information (susceptibility, barriers). meal plans and recipes (cue to action and self-efficacy) gained through dietitian-led information sessions were valued (benefits).
conclusions: a low fodmap diet does not impact ibd disease activity and inflammation markers, but leads to improved gastrointestinal symptoms compared with controls. the diet should be considered for improving functional gastrointestinal symptoms, but not an ibd treatment. there are minimal studies about patient experiences implementing the low fodmap diet, all in ibs. future research should assess patient experiences of low fodmap diet implementation, specific to ibd.

33559026,effects of gastrointestinal delivery of non-caloric tastants on energy intake: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"purpose: taste receptors are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. the activation of post-oral taste receptors using tastants could provide a non-invasive treatment option in combating the obesity epidemic. the aim of this review was to examine the effect of post-oral delivery of non-caloric tastants on eating behavior reflected by primary outcome energy intake and secondary outcomes gi symptoms and perceptions and potential underlying mechanisms. this review was conducted according to the prisma guidelines for systematic reviews.
methods: a systematic literature search of the cochrane, pubmed, embase, and medline databases was performed. this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the prospero database on 26 february 2020 (id: crd42020171182). two researchers independently screened 11,912 articles and extracted information from 19 articles. if at least two studies investigated the effect of the same taste compound on primary outcome energy intake, a meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled effect sizes.
results: nineteen papers including healthy volunteers were included. in the 19 papers analyzed, effects of various tastants were investigated in healthy volunteers. most extensively investigated were bitter tastants. the meta-analysis of effects of bitter tastants showed a significant reduction in energy intake of 54.62 kcal (95% ci - 78.54 to - 30.69, p = 0.0014).

36871131,irritable bowel syndrome is not associated with an increased risk of polyps and colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"objectives: colorectal cancer (crc) is the third most common malignancy in the us. several factors are associated with increased/decreased crc risk and often linked to adenomatous colorectal polyps (crp). recent studies suggest a lower risk of neoplastic lesions among irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients. we aimed to systematically assess the occurrence of crc and crp in ibs patients.
methods: searches of the medline, cochrane, and embase databases were performed, blindly and independently, by two investigators. studies of crc or crp incidence in ibs patients (diagnosed by rome or other symptom-based criteria) were eligible for inclusion. crc and crp effect estimates were pooled in meta-analyses using random models.
results: of 4941 non-duplicate studies, 14 were included, comprising 654,764 ibs patients and 2,277,195 controls in 8 cohort studies, and 26,641 ibs patients and 87,803 controls in 6 cross-sectional studies. pooled analysis revealed a significantly decreased prevalence of crp in ibs subjects vs. controls, with a pooled odds ratio (or) of 0.29 (95% ci (0.15, 0.54)). there was significant heterogeneity between studies (i2 = 96%, p < 0.01). this finding persisted when studies which did not report pre-cancerous polyps separately were excluded (or 0.23, 95% ci (0.15, 0.35), i2 = 85%, p < 0.01). crc prevalence was lower in ibs subjects, but this did not reach statistical significance (or 0.40, 95% ci (0.09, 1.77]).

methods: a systematic review was performed. three authors selected the articles from web of science, pubmed, scopus, and cochrane library electronic databases. risk of bias was assessed by the newcastle ottawa scale.
recent findings: most of the selected articles suggest that low testosterone levels before starting hormonal blockade imply a worse prognosis for patients with mhspc. however, the quality of the evidence is poor, the studies are heterogeneous, and it is not possible to meta-analyze most of the published results.

materials and methods: a detailed bibliographic search on four databases (pubmed, scopus, cochrane and embase) was conducted with a language restriction. the collected data were assessed according to the predefined eligibility criteria and randomized clinical trials reporting the effects of probiotics on plaque index (pi), bleeding on probing (bop) and pocket probing depth (ppd) compared to control or placebo groups were selected and analysed. the risk of bias assessment was conducted using syrcle's rob- 2 tool. the gradepro tool was used to determine the overall quality of evidence.
results: twenty-four studies (10 about gingivitis and 14 about periodontitis) were included in the meta-analysis. in the gingivitis studies, lower but non-significant pi and bop were found in the probiotic group. in periodontitis, lower pi (95%-ci [- 0.54; - 0.15], p = 0.001) were reported in the probiotic group, and this difference was greater in studies with longer follow-up. lower bop (95%-ci [- 0.58; - 0.05], p = 0.021) was also reported, but this difference was only significant in studies with a shorter follow-up (95%-ci [- 0.86; - 0.11], p = 0.012). meta-analysis for ppd showed lower, but non-significant, values (95%-ci [- 0.53; + 0.03], p = 0.077). however, this difference became significant when assessing studies with shorter follow-up (95% ci [- 0.77; - 0.07], p = 0.019).
conclusions: the meta-analysis provides evidence suggested that probiotics can serve as a beneficial adjunct to periodontal treatment in patients with periodontitis, particularly in improving clinical outcomes such as plaque index and bleeding on probing. the results from gingivitis studies highlight the need for further investigation to better understand the impact of probiotics in the early stages of periodontal disease. these findings emphasize the importance of future research with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods to confirm and expand on the clinical utility of probiotics in periodontal therapy.",Benavides-Reyes C; Cabello I; Magán-Fernández A; Rodríguez-Barranco M; Usta SN; Mesa F,2025,BMC oral health,25,1,490,10.1186/s12903-025-05888-5,"Benavides-Reyes, C., Cabello, I., Magán-Fernández, A., Rodríguez-Barranco, M., Usta, S.

objective: here, a systematic review of case-control studies detecting fecal scfas in ibs patients compared with healthy controls (hcs) and self-controlled studies or randomized controlled trials (rcts) investigating fecal scfa alterations after interventions were identified from several databases.
data sources: a systematic search of databases (pubmed, web of science, and embase) identified 21 studies published before 24 february 2023. data extractions: three independent reviewers completed the relevant data extraction.
data analysis: it was found that the fecal propionate concentration in ibs patients was significantly higher than that in hcs, while the acetate proportion was significantly lower. low-fodmap diets significantly reduced the fecal propionate concentration in the ibs patients while fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic administration did not significantly change the fecal propionate concentration or acetate proportion.
conclusions: the results suggested that the fecal propionate concentration and acetate proportion could be used as biomarkers for ibs diagnosis. a low-fodmap diet intervention could potentially serve as a treatment for ibs while fmt and probiotic administration need more robust trials.",Ju X; Jiang Z; Ma J; Yang D,2024,Nutrients,16,11,,10.3390/nu16111727,"Ju, X., Jiang, Z., Ma, J., & Yang, D.

39560589,efficacy of acupuncture treatment for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome with comorbid anxiety and depression: a meta-analysis and systematic review.,"background: presently, a diverse range of western medical interventions are accessible for the management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (ibs-d) concomitant with comorbid anxiety and depression. however, the concomitant adverse effects have also surfaced, exerting strain on healthcare resources and the socio-economic structure. in recent times, the benefits of acupuncture in the management of ibs-d with coexisting anxiety and depression have become progressively evident. nevertheless, a paucity of evidence-based medicine exists to substantiate the utilization of acupuncture for the treatment of ibs-d with anxiety and depression. the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture as an intervention for ibs-d with comorbid anxiety and depression.
methods: we searched 7 databases, including the chinese journal full-text database, wanfang academic journals full-text database, vip chinese scientific journals full-text database, china biomedical literature database, pubmed, embase, and cochrane library, for randomized controlled trials (rcts) related to acupuncture treatment for ibs with anxiety and depression, published from database inception to august 1, 2023. revman 5.4 and stata 17.0 software were used for meta-analysis of relevant outcome measures.
results: this study included a total of 16 rcts, involving 1305 ibs-d patients (691 in the experimental group and 614 in the control group). the meta-analysis results showed that compared to oral medication, acupuncture therapy improved hamd scores (md = 0.88, 95% ci = [0.68, 1.07], p < .00001), hama scores (md = 2.32, 95% ci = [1.70, 2.93], p < .00001), self-rating anxiety scale scores (md = 11.67, 95% ci = [10.85, 12.49], p < .00001), sds scores (md = 9.84, 95% ci = [8.52, 11.16], p < .00001), ibs-sss scores (md = 37.48, 95% ci = [12.17, 62.78], p = .004), overall response rate (md = 1.27, 95% ci = [1.20, 1.35], p < .00001), and relapse rate (md = 0.27, 95% ci = [0.16, 0.47], p < .00001) in patients with ibs-d comorbid with anxiety and depression.

39862384,effects of probiotics and diet management in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"context: the efficacy of probiotics and diet management in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is controversial, and their relative effectiveness remains unclear.
objective: this study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics, diet management, and their combination on ibs.
data sources: pubmed, embase, cochrane, and web of science were searched from inception to july 10, 2023, for relevant studies, including symptom relief, ibs-symptom severity score (-sss), and ibs-quality of life measure (-qol).
data extraction: two investigators independently performed the data extraction and quality assessment.
data analysis: a network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach and a random-effects model to estimate the relative risk (rr) and 95% ci.
results: forty-four articles were eligible for this study. in relieving ibs symptoms, compared with a sham diet, a low-fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (low-fodmap) diet (rr: 3.22; 95% ci: 1.70-6.26) and low-fodmap diet combined with probiotics (rr: 17.79; 95% ci: 3.27-112.54) significantly relieved ibs symptoms. the control group showed significantly lower effectiveness than the probiotics group (rr: 0.47; 95% ci: 0.32-0.69). according to the surface under the cumulative rank curve (sucra), a low-fodmap diet combined with probiotics (80.4%) had the best effect in relieving ibs symptoms, followed by a low-fodmap diet (70.8%), probiotics (65.1%), and a gluten-free diet (54.3%). in reducing the total ibs-sss, the low-fodmap diet (90.5%) was the most effective, followed by the low-fodmap diet combined with probiotics (76.6%), probiotics alone (62.3%), and gluten-free diet (28.3%). in reducing total ibs-qol, probiotics (72.1%) ranked first, followed by gluten-free (57.0%) and low-fodmap (56.9%) diets. probiotics (34.9%) were associated with the lowest risk of adverse effects.
conclusion: a low-fodmap diet combined with probiotics is most effective in relieving ibs symptoms. a low-fodmap diet is the most recommended diet for alleviating ibs severity, and probiotics were associated with improving the qol of patients with ibs, with the fewest adverse events.

38699957,a systematic review of the association between environmental risk factors and the development of irritable bowel syndrome.,"background and aim: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with roots in genetic, immune, psychological, and dietary factors. recently, the potential correlation between environmental exposures, such as air pollution, and ibs has gained attention. this review aimed to systematically examine existing studies on environmental factors associated with ibs, elucidating this interplay and guiding future research.
methods: a literature search was conducted in medline, embase, scopus, and cochrane databases from database inception to october 10, 2023, using the keywords ""irritable bowel"" or ibs or ""irritable colon"" or ""mucous colitis"" or ""spastic colitis"" or ""spastic colon"" and ""environment* exposure*"". studies were included if they were original, published in english, described defined environmental exposure(s), and had documented diagnosis of ibs. for the purposes of this review, articles reporting physical (e.g. radiation and climate change), biological (e.g. bacteria and viruses), and chemical (e.g. harmful gases) exposures were included while psychological and dietary factors, which have been reviewed in detail elsewhere, are outside of the scope.
results: a total of seven studies focusing on air quality, microbial exposure, and other environmental factors were reviewed. studies highlighted a potential association between air pollutants and increased ibs incidence. microbial exposure, post-natural disaster or due to poor sanitation, was linked to ibs development and gut dysbiosis. other exposures, such as early pet ownership, were also associated with ibs risk.

methods: case-control studies detecting scfas and 5-ht in ibs patients were identified from pubmed, web of science, cochrane library, and scopus databases to identify relevant articles up to september 2018. the standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) of scfas and 5-ht were calculated by review manager 5.3 to evaluate the alterations of 5-ht and scfas in ibs.
results: five studies on scfas and 5 on 5-ht in ibs patients were included. as compared to healthy controls (hcs), the smds of 5-ht in ibs patients was 2.35 (95% ci 0.46-4.24) and the smds of total scfas, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in ibs patients were - 0.01 (95% ci - 0.57-0.55), - 0.04 (95% ci - 0.55-0.47), 0.07 (95% ci - 0.45-0.60), and - 0.00 (95% ci - 0.49-0.49), respectively.
conclusions: there was an increase in 5-ht in blood of ibs patients, indicating the increased 5-ht in blood may be involved in ibs pathogenesis. however, there were no significant differences in scfas in feces between ibs patients and hcs. but the study did not differentiate between subgroups of ibs. these findings might provide insight for future studies of the bgm axis in the pathogenesis of ibs. mei luo and xiaojun zhuang contributed equally to the writing of this article.",Luo M; Zhuang X; Tian Z; Xiong L,2021,BMC gastroenterology,21,1,14,10.1186/s12876-020-01577-5,"Luo, M., Zhuang, X., Tian, Z., & Xiong, L.

38590140,review article: a practical approach to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease in remission.,"background: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are prevalent in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), even when endoscopic remission is reached. these symptoms can have profound negative effects on the quality of life of affected patients and can be difficult to treat. they may be caused by ibd-related complications or comorbid disorders, but they can also be explained by irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)-like symptoms.
aims: to provide a practical step-by-step guide to diagnose and treat persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with ibd in remission via a personalised approach.
methods: we scrutinised relevant literature on causes, diagnostics and treatment of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, abdominal distension, diarrhoea, constipation and faecal incontinence) in patients with ibd in remission.
results: a graphical practical guide for several steps in diagnosing, identifying potential triggers and adequate treatment of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in ibd in remission is provided based on supporting literature. the first part of this review focuses on the diagnostic and treatment approaches for potential ibd-related complications and comorbidities. the second part describes the approach to ibs-like symptoms in ibd in remission.
conclusions: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in ibd in remission can be traced back to potential pathophysiological mechanisms in individual patients and can be treated adequately. for both ibd-related complications and comorbidities and ibs-like symptoms in ibd in remission, pharmacological, dietary, lifestyle or psychological treatments can be effective. a systematic and personalised approach is required to reduce the burden for patients, healthcare systems, and society.",Aliu A; Bosch DHCA; Keszthelyi D; Rezazadeh Ardabili A; Colombel JF; Sawyer R; Törnblom H; Hart A; Jonkers DMAE; Pierik MJ; Mujagic Z,2024,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,59,12,1470-1488,10.1111/apt.17988,"Aliu, A., Bosch, D.

39449666,"micronutrients, vitamin d, and inflammatory biomarkers in covid-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of causal inference studies.","context: experimental and observational studies suggest that circulating micronutrients, including vitamin d (vd), may increase covid-19 risk and its associated outcomes. mendelian randomization (mr) studies provide valuable insight into the causal relationship between an exposure and disease outcomes.
objectives: the aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of causal inference studies that apply mr approaches to assess the role of these micronutrients, particularly vd, in covid-19 risk, infection severity, and related inflammatory markers.
data sources: searches (up to july 2023) were conducted in 4 databases.
data extraction and analysis: the quality of the studies was evaluated based on the mr-strobe guidelines. random-effects meta-analyses were conducted where possible.
results: there were 28 studies (2 overlapped) including 12 on micronutrients (8 on vd) and covid-19, 4 on micronutrients (all on vd) and inflammation, and 12 on inflammatory markers and covid-19. some of these studies reported significant causal associations between vd or other micronutrients (vitamin c, vitamin b6, iron, zinc, copper, selenium, and magnesium) and covid-19 outcomes. associations in terms of causality were also nonsignificant with regard to inflammation-related markers, except for vd levels below 25 nmol/l and c-reactive protein (crp). some studies reported causal associations between cytokines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), and other inflammatory markers and covid-19. pooled mr estimates showed that vd was not significantly associated with covid-19 outcomes, whereas ace2 increased covid-19 risk (mr odds ratio = 1.10; 95% ci: 1.01-1.19) but did not affect hospitalization or severity of the disease. the methodological quality of the studies was high in 13 studies, despite the majority (n = 24) utilizing 2-sample mr and evaluated pleiotropy.
conclusion: mr studies exhibited diversity in their approaches but do not support a causal link between vd/micronutrients and covid-19 outcomes. whether inflammation mediates the vd-covid-19 relationship remains uncertain, and highlights the need to address this aspect in future mr studies exploring micronutrient associations with covid-19 outcomes.

38431786,efficacy of mast cell directed therapies in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review.,"background and study aim: lately, mast cells (mcs) are increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). the aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of mast cell directed therapies in reducing the main symptoms of ibs: abdominal pain and changes in stool frequency or consistency.
patients and methods: pubmed, web of science and scopus were searched until december 19, 2022. trials evaluating the efficacy of mast cell directed therapies, compared to placebo or any form of control group, were included. trial selection was performed in two stages: screening titles and abstracts and reviewing full papers identified as relevant, taking into account the inclusion criteria.
results: the search strategy identified a total of 1.384 citations. eleven trials on 943 ibs patients and 197 controls were included: ten randomized controlled trials, two of which cross-over trials, and one cohort study. of the 11 studies included in the systematic review, only three studies were found to be at low risk of bias. this limited evidence suggests a significant overall improvement in the key symptoms after treatment with disodium cromoglycate, ebastine, ketotifen or palmitoylethanolamide-polydatin compared to control groups.
conclusions: mast cell modulating therapies could be of significant value in therapy for ibs patients. further high-quality research is needed to establish the therapeutic efficacy of mast cell targeted therapies in order to draw robust conclusions and improve the clinical management of irritable bowel syndrome.",Coppens D; Kips M; Stiévenard T; Mertens C; De Schepper H,2024,Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,87,1,15-27,10.51821/87.1.12487,"Coppens, D., Kips, M., Stiévenard, T., Mertens, C., & De Schepper, H.

39946356,the effect of acupuncture on quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: acupuncture has been used to improve the quality of life (qol) of patients in clinical settings. however, the effect of acupuncture on qol in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) remains unclear. we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (rcts) to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on the qol of patients with ibs.
method: pubmed, cochrane central register of controlled trials, embase, and web of science were screened from inception to september 2023. rcts published in english comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, usual care, pharmacological interventions, or other therapies were analyzed for qol in patients with ibs. the primary outcome was qol and secondary outcomes were the ibs-symptom severity scale (ibs-sss) and abdominal pain. the cochrane collaboration recommendations were used to assess the risk of bias.
findings: fourteen articles with 2,038 participants were included. the pooled result showed acupuncture can significantly improve the qol of patients with ibs compared to the conventional treatment (md = 6.62, 95% ci, 2.30 to 10.94, p<0.001, i2 = 72.45%). additionally, acupuncture was superior to other interventions in relieving the symptoms' severity of ibs (md = -46.58, 95% ci, -91.49 to -1.68, p<0.001, i2 = 90.76%). nevertheless, acupuncture was not associated with abdominal pain reduction (md = -0.35, 95% ci, -0.91 to 0.20, p = 0.21, i2 = 0.00%). lower adverse events were observed in the acupuncture group. thus, the quality of this study was relatively high.
conclusion: the meta-analysis showed that acupuncture improves qol and symptom severity in patients with ibs and that the optimal parameters for acupuncture to improve qol in patients with ibs are 30 minutes of acupuncture per session, less than or equal to five sessions per week, and a 4-week course of treatment. however, more high-quality clinical trials are needed to provide stronger evidence.",Zhou J; Lamichhane N; Xu Z; Wang J; Quynh VD; Huang J; Gao F; Zhao M; Chen Z; Zhao T,2025,PloS one,20,2,e0314678,10.1371/journal.pone.0314678,"Zhou, J., Lamichhane, N., Xu, Z., Wang, J., Quynh, V.

38191358,the effectiveness of continuity of care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"aim: to investigate the effectiveness of continuity of care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
background: the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease(ibd) is increasing by years, especially in china. moreover, ibd is prolonged and difficult to heal, which seriously impairs the quality of life of patients. some studies have identified that continuity of care could contribute to the improvement of the quality of life, but the results remains inconclusive in patients with ibd.
methods: prisma guidelines was the outline of this study. review manager software (version 5.3) was used to carry out the data analysis. outcome assessments included quality of life (qol), remission rates, number of outpatient clinic visits, and medication adherence.
results: ultimately, 12 studies involving 2415 patients were brought into this meta-analysis. the results indicated there was no significant difference for continuity of care to improve the qol in intervention group (smd = 0.02, 95% ci: -0.08, 0.12). besides, the remission rates of disease had no difference with those patients in the two groups (or = 1.07, 95% ci: 0.72, 1.60). however, continued care could contribute to the number of outpatient clinic visits (md = -0.84, 95% ci: -1.19, -0.49) and patients' adherence to medication significantly (or = 2.40, 95% ci: 1.16, 4.95).
conclusions: ibd patients could benefited from continuity of care with reducing their number of clinic visits and improving medication adherence. nonetheless, there was no evidence of continuity of care contribute to qol and remission of disease for these patients.",Gu Z; Gu J; Liu P,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,24,10.1186/s12876-023-03109-3,"Gu, Z., Gu, J., & Liu, P.

39091663,acceptance and commitment therapy for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review.,"background and objective: cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) is a common treatment modality for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). cbt may not be a good fit for all patients and some may instead benefit from an acceptance and commitment therapy (act) approach. this narrative review presents evidence for the use of act in adult patients with ibs or ibd. the authors also suggest instances in which patients with ibs or ibd may benefit from act and discuss future directions of research.
methods: between august 2023 and january 2024, databases such as google scholar, institutional libraries, and pubmed were used to review the literature on act in patients with ibs and ibd. a variety of search terms were included. non-english, pediatric, and studies that did not employ a full act protocol were excluded.
key content and findings: act for ibs studies typically utilized a self-help book or a one-day workshop intervention, with results indicating reductions in ibs and mood symptoms and improvements in quality of life. within ibd, three randomized controlled trials (rcts) tested the impact of act, two of which found reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms.
conclusions: despite the limited number of studies testing a full act protocol in patient populations with ibs or ibd, results indicate potential efficacy in managing not only symptoms, but also facets of quality of life. future studies should utilize robust experimental designs and comprehensively test the effectiveness of act in ibs and ibd patient populations with both process and outcome measures.",Marchese SH; Naftaly JP; Pandolfino J,2024,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,9,,43,10.21037/tgh-24-10,"Marchese, S.

34755926,oral and parenteral anti-neuropathic agents for the management of pain and discomfort in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a highly prevalent and economically burdensome condition; and pain is often the most unpleasant, disruptive, and difficult-to-treat symptom. visceral hypersensitivity is a common feature driving pain in ibs, suggesting that neuropathic mechanisms may be implicated. we conducted a systematic review of available evidence to examine the role of anti-neuropathic medicines in the management of pain in ibs.
methods: we systematically searched scientific repositories for trials investigating conventional oral, and/or parenteral, pharmaceutical antineuropathic treatments in patients with ibs. we summarized key participant characteristics, outcomes related to pain (primary outcome), and selected secondary outcomes.
key results: we included 13 studies (n = 629 participants): six investigated amitriptyline, three duloxetine, three pregabalin, and one gabapentin. there was considerable methodological and statistical heterogeneity, so we performed a narrative synthesis and limited meta-analysis. amitriptyline was most extensively studied, though only in diarrhea-predominant patients. in individual trials, amitriptyline, pregabalin and gabapentin generally appeared beneficial for pain outcomes. while duloxetine studies tended to report improvements in pain, all were un-controlled trials with high risk of bias. meta-analysis of three studies (n = 278) yielded a pooled relative-risk of 0.50 (95%ci 0.38-0.66) for not improving with anti-neuropathic agent vs control. we did not identify any eligible studies investigating the role of parenteral anti-neuropathics.
conclusions and inferences: anti-neuropathic analgesics may improve pain in ibs, and deserve further, high-quality investigation, potentially considering parenteral administration and agents with minimal gastrointestinal motility effects. investigation of amitriptyline's efficacy in non-diarrhea-predominant subtypes is currently lacking, and we recommend particular caution for its use in ibs-c.",Lambarth A; Zarate-Lopez N; Fayaz A,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,1,e14289,10.1111/nmo.14289,"Lambarth, A., Zarate-Lopez, N., & Fayaz, A.

methods: a systematic literature search was conducted using pubmed, embase, and scopus, including terms related to ibs, lactose intolerance, and self-reported symptoms, without applying filters to ensure comprehensive coverage. inclusion criteria focused on observational studies with adult participants diagnosed with lactose intolerance, addressing symptoms and lactose malabsorption, while excluding non-english articles, reviews, editorials, and studies involving pediatric subjects.
results: the systematic review analyzed six studies with 845 participants, revealing significant variability and moderate accuracy in self-reported lactose intolerance for diagnosing actual lactose intolerance in ibs patients. hydrogen breath tests (hbts) showed that self-reported symptoms often led to false positives, underscoring the need for objective diagnostic tools and standardized criteria. the findings highlight the complexity of diagnosing lactose intolerance in ibs patients and suggest that lactose-free diets and routine hbt should not be recommended without clear indications.
conclusions: the rigorous selection process ensured the inclusion of high-quality, relevant studies, thereby enhancing the reliability and validity of the review's findings. these studies revealed that a lactose-free diet should not be routinely recommended for ibs patients, nor should the routine use of hbt to identify lactose malabsorption in this group. future research should focus on better understanding the factors influencing lactose perception and tolerance, which is crucial for more effective management of lactose intolerance in ibs patients.",Pop A; Popa SL; Pop DD; Ismaiel A; Nechita VI; Dumitrascu DL,2024,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,,,,10.15403/jgld-5836,"Pop, A., Popa, S.

discussion: based on the available randomized controlled trials (rcts), the current evidence does not support the efficacy of fmt in improving global ibs symptoms in the long term. the differential results observed in subgroup analyses raise questions about the accurate identification of suitable populations for fmt. further investigation is needed to better understand the reasons behind these inconsistent findings and to determine the true potential of fmt as a treatment for ibs.",Wang Y; Hu Y; Shi P,2024,BMC gastroenterology,24,1,217,10.1186/s12876-024-03311-x,"Wang, Y., Hu, Y., & Shi, P.

40083695,what is the impact of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in solid tumours: a qualitative systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis.,"endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (endmt) has gained increasing recognition as a crucial mechanism in the progression of solid cancers, influencing tumour heterogeneity, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. however, despite its growing importance, endmt remains insufficiently studied within the cancer research landscape. in this study, we conduct a systematic review, adhered to the 2020 prisma guidelines, of the existing literature on endmt in solid tumours, examining its functional roles, key biomarkers, underlying mechanisms, experimental models, and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. our objective was to identify critical areas where further research is needed. in addition, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the variability in the expression of endmt-related markers and their potential links to patient prognosis. to this aim, literature searches were conducted in major databases including pubmed, scopus, and web of science, covering studies published up to june 2024. the risk of bias of selected articles was evaluated using the ohat tool, for the in vitro experiments and the syrcle tool for studies using animal models. out of an initial pool of 1,197 articles, 54 studies were selected for data extraction by two independent reviewers. selected studies were identified according to specific inclusion/exclusion criteria applied through distinct stages like ""title and abstract screening"", ""full text article review"" and ""article bibliography screening"". our analysis confirms that endmt is a key contributor to tumour progression and metastasis, but several aspects remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the induction of endmt in specific cancer types, its role in lymphatic endothelial cells, and its interactions with other stromal elements. we observed substantial heterogeneity in the biomarkers associated with endmt, as well as variations in the endothelial cell types studied, the functional outcomes, and the molecular mechanisms involved. our meta-analysis revealed significant variability in the expression of endmt biomarkers, with notable correlations between changes in the expression of specific genes and patient outcomes, particularly in lung cancer. in conclusion, it is essential for future research to focus on identifying the specific cancer and stromal cell types implicated in endmt and to standardize endothelial cell models and protocols used for inducing endmt. investigating endmt alongside well-established processes, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt), and exploring its relationship with cancer-associated fibroblasts (cafs) may provide valuable insights into its role in tumour biology and its impact on therapy resistance.",Hernández-Camarero P; Toledo B; Diaz-Ruano AB; González-Titos A; García-Ortega MB; Perán M,2025,International journal of biological sciences,21,5,2155-2178,10.7150/ijbs.107045,"Hernández-Camarero, P., Toledo, B., Diaz-Ruano, A.

methods: a literature search for digestive and extra-digestive disorders related to lm was carried out using pubmed, medline and cochrane.
results: a transient lactase deficiency is present in celiac disease (cd) on a normal diet. the persistence of symptoms in cd on a gluten-free diet may be instead, in part, attributed to a primary lm. similar circumstances are present in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), in which lm can be responsible for a part of persistent symptoms in ibd on clinical remission. lm and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) are instead independent conditions. on the other hand, a lactose-restricted diet may be useful for some ibs patients. a reduced lactose intake can lead to low bone mass and limited risk of fragility fractures. finally, the absorption of levothyroxine could be conditioned by lm.
conclusions: lm can be responsible for persistent symptoms in cd and ibd. the association with ibs seems to be casual. bone mass and levothyroxine absorption can be affected by lm.",Usai-Satta P; Lai M; Oppia F,2022,Nutrients,14,3,,10.3390/nu14030584,"Usai-Satta, P., Lai, M., & Oppia, F.

background: ibs is highly effective to reduce the use of allogeneic blood transfusion. however, the safety of ibs during liver transplantation for patients with hcc is questioned due to fear of disseminating malignant cells.
methods: comprehensive searches through june 2021 were performed in 8 databases. the methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the robins-i tool. meta-analysis with the generic inverse variance method was performed to calculate pooled hazard ratios (hrs) for disease-free survival, hcc recurrence and overall survival.
results: nine studies were included (n=1997, ibs n=1200, no-ibs n=797). use of ibs during liver transplantation was not associated with impaired disease-free survival [hr=0.90, 95% confidence interval (ci)=0.66-1.24, p=0.53, ibs n=394, no-ibs n=329], not associated with increased hcc recurrence (hr=0.83, 95% ci=0.57-1.23, p=0.36, ibs n=537, no-ibs n=382) and not associated with impaired overall survival (hr=1.04, 95% ci=0.79-1.37, p=0.76, ibs n=495, no-ibs n=356).

37031468,efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials using rome iv criteria.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which affects a great number of patients globally. clinical trials and meta-analyses have evaluated different therapies for ibs. some of them have shown that probiotics play a significant role in the management of ibs-patients. nevertheless, results are controversial, and the efficacy of the administration of probiotics remains to be confirmed, especially in regard to which type of probiotic-strains are beneficial.
aim: the aim of the present meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of the administration of probiotics to ibs-patients with a diagnosis based on rome iv criteria, which is performed for the first time.
methods: electronic databases (pubmed, scopus and cochrane) were searched until 26.01.2023 for randomized controlled trials (rcts) studying the administration of probiotics in adult ibs-patients, who were categorized according to the rome iv criteria. the risk of bias was assessed using the cochrane risk of bias tool (rob) 2.0. weighted and standardized mean difference with the 95% confidence intervals were used for the synthesis of the results. primary outcomes were the decrease of ibs-symptom severity score (ibs-sss) and decrease of abdominal pain. the secondary outcomes were the improvement in quality of life (qol) and the decrease of bloating. lastly, the adverse effects of probiotics were evaluated. the protocol of the study has been registered at protocols.io (doi dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn218yg5d/v1).
results: six double-blind (n = 970) placebo-control rcts fulfilled the inclusion criteria and overall, nine different strains of probiotics were examined. no significant reduction in ibs-sss (wmd -43.2, 95% ci -87.5 to 1.0, i2 = 82.9%) was demonstrated, whereas a significant decrease regarding abdominal pain (smd -0.94, 95% ci -1.53 to -0.35, i2 = 92,2) was shown. furthermore, no correlation between improvement of qol and the use of probiotics (smd -0.64, 95% ci -1.27 to 0.00, i2 = 93,9%) was shown. however, probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in bloating (smd -0.28, 95% ci -0.47 to -0.09, i2 = 36,0%). a qualitative synthesis was conducted about adverse events and showed that the use of probiotics' is safe without severe adverse events.
conclusions: the administration of probiotics to ibs-patients demonstrated a positive effect on pain and bloating, but due to significant heterogeneity and confounding factors, that were not examined in the included studies, a definitive statement cannot be made. moreover, probiotics did not lead to an improvement in other parameters. there is a need for larger rcts in ibs-patients diagnosed according to rome iv (not iii) criteria and especially it is essential to be conducted rcts which examine the administration of specific strains and have similar methodological characteristics.",Konstantis G; Efstathiou S; Pourzitaki C; Kitsikidou E; Germanidis G; Chourdakis M,2023,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",42,5,800-809,10.1016/j.clnu.2023.03.019,"Konstantis, G., Efstathiou, S., Pourzitaki, C., Kitsikidou, E., Germanidis, G., & Chourdakis, M.

39669195,herbal placebo response in clinical trials on irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"aim of the study: to systematically evaluate the herbal placebo response in randomized controlled trials (rcts) of herbal medicine on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs).
materials and methods: we searched for rcts with herbal placebo groups for ibs in pubmed, embase, the cochrane library, the china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki), the wan fang database and sinomed database from 31 january 1994 to november 2023, and the quality of the literature was evaluated by the cochrane risk of bias assessment criteria. the primary outcome indicators were response rate, abdominal pain and stool improvement rate, which were analyzed by single-group rate meta-analysis. secondary outcomes were analyzed in subgroups based on diagnostic criteria, duration of treatment, subtype, research locations, placebo form, and presence of herbal ingredients to look for factors affecting respond rate.
results: the study included 24 papers, involving a total of 2,596 patients. of these, 1151 ibs patients were treated with the herbal placebo. the placebo response rate in ibs patients in the herbal placebo group was 37% (p < 0.01,i2 = 75%). a total of 287 patients in five studies were given the herbal placebo, and the improvement rate of abdominal pain was 29% (p = 0.83, i2 = 0%). four studies enrolled a total of 212 patients with ibs who received herbal placebo, and the stool improvement rate was 46% (p = 0.02 < 0.05, i2 = 71%). the research locations and treatment duration were sources of heterogeneity (p < 0.05).
conclusion: there is a significant herbal placebo response in patients with ibs. different research locations and treatment durations are major sources of heterogeneity that may affect ibs patient response rates. the addition of a low dose of herbal ingredients when simulating an herbal placebo does not exaggerate the therapeutic effect of the placebo. there is a lack of uniformity and standardization in the preparation and evaluation of herbal placebos.",Huang K; Lv M; Zheng T; Wang F; Tang X; Lv L,2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,15,,1475366,10.3389/fphar.2024.1475366,"Huang, K., Lv, M., Zheng, T., Wang, F., Tang, X., & Lv, L.

objectives: the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the impact of a low fodmap diet on the composition and function of the microbiome in patients with ibs.
methods: a systematic search was conducted for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of a low fodmap diet on the colonic microbiome in patients with ibs in medline, embase, central, and web of science from inception to april 2022. outcomes included diversity of the microbiome, specific bacterial abundances, fecal scfa concentration, and fecal ph. for fecal scfa concentrations and ph, meta-analyses were performed via a random-effects model.
results: nine trials involving 403 patients were included. there were no clear effects of the low fodmap diet on diversity of the microbiome. a low fodmap diet consistently led to lower abundance of bifidobacteria, but there were no clear effects on diversity of the microbiome or abundances of other specific taxa. there were no differences in total fecal scfa concentration between the low fodmap diet and control diets (standardized mean difference: -0.25; 95% ci: -0.63, 0.13; p = 0.20), nor were there differences for fecal concentrations of specific scfas or fecal ph.
conclusions: in patients with ibs, the effects of a low fodmap diet on the colonic microbiome appear to be specific to bifidobacteria with no consistent impacts on other microbiome metrics, including diversity, fecal scfa concentrations, and fecal ph. further, adequately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings.this review was registered at https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ as crd42020192243.",So D; Loughman A; Staudacher HM,2022,The American journal of clinical nutrition,116,4,943-952,10.1093/ajcn/nqac176,"So, D., Loughman, A., & Staudacher, H.

methods: we searched the cochrane library, pubmed, embase and web of science databases up to 1 may 2019. randomized controlled trials (rcts) involving adults with ibs-c that compared probiotics to placebo or no therapy were eligible for the analysis. dichotomous symptom data were pooled to calculate the relative risk (rr) with a 95% confidence interval (ci) of remaining symptoms after therapy. continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference (md) with the 95% ci. two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. the analysis was performed using review manager version 5.2.
results: seventeen rcts involving 1469 patients were included in the analysis. overall, probiotics significantly increased stool frequency by 1.29 bowel movements (bm)/wk (95% ci: 0.69 to 1.89 bm/wk; p < 0.0001), and improved stool consistency (smd: 0.55; 95% ci: 0.27 to 0.82; p = 0.0001). compared with placebo, patients using probiotics experienced a shorter gut transit time by 12.36 h (95% ci: -20.74 to -3.98 h; p = 0.004). no serious adverse events were reported.
conclusions: generally, probiotics may be safe and may improve whole gut transit time, stool frequency, and stool consistency. however, adequately powered rcts are required to better determine the species or strains, doses, and duration of use of probiotics that are most efficacious. further research and evidence is required before probiotics is adopted as one of treatments of ibs-c.",Wen Y; Li J; Long Q; Yue CC; He B; Tang XG,2020,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",79,,111-119,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.063,"Wen, Y., Li, J., Long, Q., Yue, C.

33614028,the role of faecal microbiota transplantation: looking beyond clostridioides difficile infection.,"faecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is the transfer of screened and minimally processed faecal material from a 'healthy' donor to 'diseased' recipient. it has an established role, and is recommended as a therapeutic strategy, in the management of recurrent clostridioides difficile infection (cdi). recognition that gut dysbiosis is associated with, and may contribute to, numerous disease states has led to interest in exploiting fmt to 'correct' this microbial imbalance. conditions for which it is proposed to be beneficial include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, systemic inflammatory states like sepsis, and even coronavirus disease 2019. to understand what role, if any, fmt may play in the management of these conditions, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of the therapy. regardless, there are several barriers to its more widespread adoption, which include incompletely understood mechanism of action (especially outside of cdi), inability to standardise treatment, disagreement on its active ingredients and how it should be regulated, and lack of long-term outcome and safety data. whilst the transfer of faecal material from one individual to another to treat ailments or improve health has a history dating back thousands of years, there are fewer than 10 randomised controlled trials supporting its use. moving forward, it will be imperative to gather as much data from fmt donors and recipients over as long a timeframe as possible, and for trials to be conducted with rigorous methodology, including appropriate control groups, in order to best understand the utility of fmt for indications beyond cdi. this review discusses the history of fmt, its appreciable mechanisms of action with reference to cdi, indications for fmt with an emerging evidence base above and beyond cdi, and future perspectives on the field.",D Goldenberg S; Merrick B,2021,Therapeutic advances in infectious disease,8,,2049936120981526,10.1177/2049936120981526,"D Goldenberg, S., & Merrick, B.

34684663,vitamin d supplementation and mental health in inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome patients: a systematic review.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) are associated with decreased quality of life and mental health problems. among various approaches to supportive therapy that aims to improve mental health in affected individuals, vitamin d supplementation is considered to be an effective method which may also be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms during the course of ibds and ibs. the aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin d supplementation on mental health in adults with inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, including ibds and ibs. this study was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines and registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero) database (registration number crd42020155779). a systematic search of the pubmed and web of science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until september 2021 were included. the human studies eligible to be included in the review should have described any intervention involving vitamin d as a supplement in a group of adult patients suffering from ibds and/or ibs and should have assessed any component of mental health, but studies presenting the effects of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. after eliminating the duplicates, a total of 8514 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers. further evaluation was carried out on the basis of title, abstract, and full text. finally, 10 studies (four for ibds and six for ibs) were selected for the current systematic review, and their quality was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale (nos). the studies analyzed the influence of various doses of vitamin d on bowel diseases, compared the results of vitamin d supplementation with placebo, or administered specific doses of vitamin d to obtain the required level in the blood. supplementation was performed for at least 6 weeks. the analyzed mental health outcomes mainly included disease-specific quality of life/quality of life, anxiety, and depression. the majority of studies (including high-quality ones) confirmed the positive effect of vitamin d supplementation on the mental health of ibd and ibs patients, which was proven by all research works evaluating anxiety and depression and by the majority of research works evaluating quality of life. although the studies followed different dosage regimens and supplementation protocols, the positive influence of vitamin d on mental health was found to be consistent. the number of studies on patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and the availability of trials randomized against the placebo group was low in the current review, which is considered to be a limitation of the present study and could also reflect the final outcome of the analysis. the conducted systematic review established the positive effect of vitamin d supplementation on the mental health of ibd and ibs patients, but this result requires further investigation, particularly in relation to other mental health outcomes.",Głąbska D; Kołota A; Lachowicz K; Skolmowska D; Stachoń M; Guzek D,2021,Nutrients,13,10,,10.3390/nu13103662,"Głąbska, D., Kołota, A., Lachowicz, K., Skolmowska, D., Stachoń, M., & Guzek, D.

39057399,fucoidan as a promising drug for pain treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"fucoidan is a polymer of l-fucose and l-fucose-4-sulphate naturally found in marine sources that inhibits p-selectin, preventing neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury. fucoidan is employed in many studies as a tool to investigate the contribution of neutrophils to pain, showing analgesic effects. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the analgesic effects of pretreatment with fucoidan reported in the available preclinical studies. in addition, we summarized the articles which have studied the therapeutic effects of fucoidan in pathological pain at preclinical and clinical levels. the results of this systematic review reveal that pretreatment with fucoidan is a powerful tool which reduces neutrophil infiltration by 70-90% at early time points. this meta-analysis showed that preventative treatment with fucoidan produced a significant pain reduction. in addition, several preclinical studies have observed that fucoidan treatment reduces the pain that is associated with various pathologies. finally, fucoidan has also been tested in several clinical trials, with some degree of analgesic efficacy, but they were mostly small pilot studies. considering all the above information, it can be concluded that fucoidan is not only a preclinical tool for studying the role of neutrophils in pain but also a promising therapeutic strategy for pain treatment.",Huerta MÁ; Tejada MÁ; Nieto FR,2024,Marine drugs,22,7,,10.3390/md22070290,"Huerta, M.

35308554,risk of colorectal cancer in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of population-based observational studies.,"background and aims: evidence on the association between irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and colorectal cancer (crc) risk is inconsistent. therefore, we aimed to examine whether ibs leads to an increased risk for crc using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach.
methods: pubmed, embase, and web of science were systematically searched to identify all relevant literature published through july 30, 2021. the pooled risk ratios (rrs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis) for crc after diagnosis of ibs were computed using random-and fixed-effects models and stratified by age, follow-up time, gender, and study design. the quality of included studies was assessed by the newcastle-ottawa scale.
results: we included six studies consisting of 1,085,024 participants. overall, the risk of detecting crc after the initial ibs diagnosis was significantly higher than non-ibs controls (rr = 1.52, 95% ci: 1.04-2.22, p = 0.032). the peak of elevated risk occurred within the first year of ibs diagnosis (rr = 6.84, 95% ci: 3.70-12.65, p < 0.001), and after 1 year, the risk of crc was similar to that of the general population (rr = 1.02, 95% ci: 0.88-1.18, p = 0.813). notably, we found that the rr of crc was more significant in ibs patients younger than 50 years compared to those older than 50 years (rr = 2.03, 95% ci: 1.17-3.53, p = 0.012 vs. 1.28, 95%ci: 0.94-1.75, p = 0.118, respectively). gender and study design did not affect the results.
conclusion: the risk of crc within one year of the initial ibs diagnosis was increased approximately six-fold, whereas the long-term risk was not increased. however, current evidence does not support that ibs leads to an increased incidence of crc, and the early excess risk is more likely attributable to misclassification resulting from overlapping symptoms rather than causation. clinicians must remain vigilant for the crc risk in patients younger than 50 years with ibs-like symptoms to avoid delaying necessary screening.",Wu X; Wang J; Ye Z; Wang J; Liao X; Liv M; Svn Z,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,819122,10.3389/fmed.2022.819122,"Wu, X., Wang, J., Ye, Z., Wang, J., Liao, X., Liv, M., & Svn, Z.

36097404,anti-inflammatory effects of vagal nerve stimulation with a special attention to intestinal barrier dysfunction.,"the vagus nerve (vn), the longest nerve of the organism innervating the gastrointestinal tract, is a mixed nerve with anti-inflammatory properties through its afferents, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, and its efferents through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tnfα) by splenic and gut macrophages. in addition, the vn is also able to modulate the permeability of the intestinal barrier although the vn does not innervate directly the intestinal epithelium. targeting the vn through vn stimulation (vns) has been developed in experimental model of intestinal inflammation and in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and might be of interest to decrease intestinal permeability in gastrointestinal disorders with intestinal barrier defect such as ibd, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and celiac disease. in this issue of neurogastroenterology and motility, mogilevski et al. report that a brief non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vns in healthy volunteers consistently reduces the permeability of the small intestine induced by intravenous administration of the stress peptide corticotropin releasing hormone, known to increase intestinal permeability and to inhibit the vn. in this review, we outline the mechanistic underpinning the effect of stress, of the vn and vns on intestinal permeability. in particular, the vn can act on intestinal permeability through enteric nerves, and/or cells such as enteric glial cells. we also review the existing evidence of the effects vns on intestinal permeability in models such as burn intestinal injury and traumatic brain injury, which pave the way for future clinical trials in ibd, ibs, and celiac disease.",Bonaz B,2022,Neurogastroenterology and motility,34,10,e14456,10.1111/nmo.14456,"Bonaz, B.

aims: to describe and evaluate the characteristics of integrated models of care for ibs and identify how digital health is being used in these models of care.
methods: four databases were searched to march 2024 for studies that included adults with ibs who participated in multidisciplinary integrated models of care that delivered non-pharmacological therapies. the template for intervention description and replication (tidier) checklist was used to appraise study quality and extract model of care characteristics, which were mapped against the project integrate framework to establish topics.
results: sixteen studies (6 randomized controlled trials, 2 quasi-experimental, 8 cohort studies) reported 14 integrated models of care including 2165 patients of which 918 were ibs patients. integrated models of care led to improved ibs symptoms (n = 11/13 models of care) and qol (n = 6/9 models of care). studies showed moderate compliance with the tidier checklist. five topics were established: clinicians involved, therapies provided, location and mode of delivery, coordinating clinical partnerships, and sharing visions and values of integrated care. most commonly, a gastroenterologist coordinated care with a psychologist, dietitian, and/or nurse in tertiary care. psychological, dietary, and physical therapies were provided by n = 11, n = 8, and n = 3 integrated models of care, respectively. six models of care provided joint consultations or group sessions. four models of care used digital health such as telephone coaching or online modules.

background: there is limited composite data on the outcomes of esd for rtdls versus non-rtdls.
study: we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported the clinical outcomes of esd for rtdls and non-rtdls. main outcomes were pooled estimated rates of en bloc/complete/curative resection, local recurrence, and incidence of bleeding, perforation, stricture, anal pain, and fever.
results: six studies were enrolled, including 265 cases of rtdls and 788 cases of non-rtdls. the en bloc resection rate was comparable for rtdls and non-rtdls [odds ratio (or), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.55-1.95; p=0.90]. the complete resection rate was significantly lower for rtdls (or, 0.59; 95% ci, 0.41-0.83; p=0.003), as well as the curative resection rate (or, 0.57; 95% ci, 0.38-0.87; p=0.010). the rates of stricture, postoperative anal pain and local recurrence were significantly higher for rtdls than non-rtdls (or, 3.07; 95% ci, 1.01-9.31; p=0.05) (or, 42.10; 95% ci, 4.73-374.97; p=0.0008) (or, 3.00; 95% ci, 1.13-7.96; p=0.03), but the higher rates of postoperative bleeding and fever for rtdls were not significantly (or, 1.33; 95% ci, 0.53-3.30; p=0.54) (or, 2.23; 95% ci, 0.55-9.07; p=0.26), as well as its lower perforation rate (or, 0.85; 95% ci, 0.27-2.63; p=0.78).

objective: this systematic review aims to examine the relationship between attention and ibs, focusing on the affected domains of attention and the interactions within the brain-gut axis.
methods: a comprehensive search was conducted across medline/pubmed, psychinfo, and scopus from january 1990 to december 2024. studies included were those that assessed attention in adult ibs patients using valid measurement tools. a total of 24 studies were analyzed, incorporating neuroimaging and behavioral methods.
results: ibs individuals exhibit specific attentional impairments, including deficits in sustained attention, selective attentional biases toward gastrointestinal (gi)-related and symptom-specific stimuli, and heightened vigilance to threat and pain cues. neurofunctional studies reveal altered brain activity in areas such as the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, indicating increased interoceptive awareness and cognitive load. pre-attentive processing and sensory gating show exaggerated responses, while sustained attention and attentional control demand additional cognitive resources. these patterns reflect an interplay between heightened sensitivity to internal stimuli and cognitive processing challenges in ibs.
conclusion: this review highlights specific attentional deficits and biases in ibs, suggesting they may contribute to symptom exacerbation and emotional distress. further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions.",Akbari R; Salimi Y; Dehghani-Aarani F; Rezayat E,2025,Journal of psychosomatic research,191,,112067,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2025.112067,"Akbari, R., Salimi, Y., Dehghani-Aarani, F., & Rezayat, E.

36364953,impact of total parenteral nutrition on gut microbiota in pediatric population suffering intestinal disorders.,"parenteral nutrition (pn) is a life-saving therapy providing nutritional support in patients with digestive tract complications, particularly in preterm neonates due to their gut immaturity during the first postnatal weeks. despite this, pn can also result in several gastrointestinal complications that are the cause or consequence of gut mucosal atrophy and gut microbiota dysbiosis, which may further aggravate gastrointestinal disorders. consequently, the use of pn presents many unique challenges, notably in terms of the potential role of the gut microbiota on the functional and clinical outcomes associated with the long-term use of pn. in this review, we synthesize the current evidence on the effects of pn on gut microbiome in infants and children suffering from diverse gastrointestinal diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), short bowel syndrome (sbs) and subsequent intestinal failure, liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). moreover, we discuss the potential use of pre-, pro- and/or synbiotics as promising therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of severe gastrointestinal disorders and mortality. the findings discussed here highlight the need for more well-designed studies, and harmonize the methods and its interpretation, which are critical to better understand the role of the gut microbiota in pn-related diseases and the development of efficient and personalized approaches based on pro- and/or prebiotics.",Cerdó T; García-Santos JA; Rodríguez-Pöhnlein A; García-Ricobaraza M; Nieto-Ruíz A; G Bermúdez M; Campoy C,2022,Nutrients,14,21,,10.3390/nu14214691,"Cerdó, T., García-Santos, J.

39110917,nutritional interventions in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials.,"context: there is still debate regarding the effect of nutritional interventions in improving irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) symptoms.
objectives: the aim was to examine the evidence certainty and validity of all existing meta-analyses of intervention trials on nutritional interventions in patients with ibs.
data sources: scopus, pubmed, and web of science were reviewed until june 2023.
data extraction: meta-analyses assessing the impacts of nutritional interventions in adults with ibs were entered. effect sizes of nutritional interventions were recalculated by applying a random-effects model. grade (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) was implemented to determine evidence certainty.
results: a total of 175 trials in 58 meta-analyses were entered describing the effects of 11 nutritional interventions on ibs-related outcomes. nutritional interventions had beneficial effects on some ibs-related outcomes. for instance, soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and aloe vera improved ibs symptoms, and vitamin d3 and curcumin improved ibs symptom severity. tongxieyaofang improved abdominal pain severity and stool frequency. nevertheless, these outcomes have mainly shown small effects and low to very low evidence certainty. with regard to abdominal pain after probiotic supplementation (relative risk [rr]: 4.04; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.36, 6.92; grade = moderate) and ibs symptoms after a low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (fodmap) diet (rr: 1.48; 95% ci: 1.14, 1.93; grade = moderate), there was evidence that probiotics and a low-fodmap diet can confer clinical and favorable effects.
conclusion: the current review does not support nutritional interventions for improving ibs symptoms. with regard to probiotics and a low-fodmap diet, considering limitations like short-term study duration, there was an influential clinical impact.

40735813,impacts of the long-term low-fodmap diet in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and objectives: the low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols diet (lfd) is the primary intervention for managing irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). however, due to its restrictive nature, concerns have been raised about its safety and efficacy with long-term use. this study aims to investigate the outcomes of long-term lfd (llfd) in patients with ibs.
methods: a systematic search was performed in pubmed, embase and scopus up to november 2024. llfd was defined as lfd for at least 6 months. a random-effects model was applied to estimate the standardised mean difference (smd) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) for each outcome. the protocol of the study was registered in prospero (id crd42024609338).
results: of the total 2724 screened records, five studies finally met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study (324 patients). llfd was able to reduce overall gastrointestinal symptoms (smd -1.97, 95% ci -3.63 to -0.30), anxiety (smd -0.40, 95% ci -0.65 to -0.15) and depression (smd -0.28, 95% ci -0.53, to -0.03). additionally, llfd improved quality of life (mean difference 0.53, 95% ci 0.24-0.83). however, it was not able to improve the quality of sleep (smd -0.13, 95% ci -0.39 to 0.12).

34425274,placebo response rates in trials of licensed drugs for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation or diarrhea: meta-analysis.,"background & aims: there are several licensed drugs for irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) that have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials (rcts), but placebo response rates are high. we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of licensed drugs to estimate magnitude of placebo response rate according to food and drug administration (fda)-recommended endpoints and to assess how this varies with stringency of the endpoint used to define response.
methods: we searched medline, embase classic and embase, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials (through january 2021) to identify rcts comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adult ibs patients. studies assessed efficacy according to at least one of composite response, abdominal pain response, or stool response. data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, with dropouts assumed to be treatment failures and pooled using a random-effects model.
results: there were 17 rcts of licensed drugs versus placebo in ibs with constipation (4603 patients placebo) and 17 trials in ibs with diarrhea (3908 patients placebo). in ibs with constipation, according to fda criteria, pooled composite, abdominal pain, and stool response rates with placebo over ≥6 of 12 weeks were 18.9%, 34.6%, and 30.1%, respectively. evaluating response rates over ≥9 of 12 weeks led to placebo response rates of 4.3% for the composite endpoint, 24.5% for abdominal pain, and 7.7% for stool. in ibs with diarrhea, pooled placebo response rates according to fda criteria were 16.2% for the composite endpoint, 40.2% for abdominal pain, and 16.2% for stool. increasing the threshold used to define abdominal pain response from ≥30% improvement to ≥40% or ≥50% led to lower placebo response rates of 34.5% and 23.4%.

methods: in a cross-sectional multicentric study, consecutive patients with ax-spa treated with biologics in five rheumatology departments were asked for ibs rome iv criteria. demographic data, lifestyle behaviours and disease characteristics were recorded. second, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines.
results: of the 500 patients with ax-spa included, 124 reported ibs symptoms (25%). female gender, unemployment, higher bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai) and worse bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index scores, multiple lines of biologics, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression and lower physical activity were associated with ibs symptoms. in multivariate model, the risk of ibs was associated with anxiety and physical inactivity. from the literature review, the prevalence of ibs in patients with spa was 15.4% (8.8% to 23.3%). meta-analysis of the five studies comparing the presence of ibs in patients with spa (323/7292) and healthy controls (484/35587) showed a significant increase of ibs in patients with spa (or=1.59 (1.05 to 2.40)).
conclusion: the prevalence of ibs symptoms was high in the ax-spa population and should therefore be considered in the presence of gastrointestinal disorders. the presence of ibs symptoms was associated with anxiety and low physical activity in multivariate analysis. patients with ibs symptoms tended to have more difficult to manage disease characterised by higher activity, worse functional score and multiple lines of treatment in univariate analysis.",Bernard J; Barnetche T; Amory C; Despres J; Vandersmissen M; Landrin J; Gaujoux-Viala C; Lukas C; Ruyssen-Witrand A; Truchetet ME; Vergne-Salle P; Mathieu S; Tournadre A,2024,RMD open,10,1,,10.1136/rmdopen-2023-003836,"Bernard, J., Barnetche, T., Amory, C., Despres, J., Vandersmissen, M., Landrin, J., Gaujoux-Viala, C., Lukas, C., Ruyssen-Witrand, A., Truchetet, M.

methods: a network meta-analysis was conducted by systematically searching the pubmed, embase, and cochrane libraries. according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included randomized controlled trials (rcts) of biological agents, tofacitinib, and fmt in uc. a random-effect model was chosen by the network meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. heterogeneity test and publication bias test were performed to determine the efficacy of treatments.
results: data were extracted from 16 rcts and we found that all treatments were more effective than the placebos. a total of 21 comparisons were made to determine efficiency. we found that infliximab, vedolizumab, and fmt performed better curative effect in terms of absolute effects and relative ranks. furthermore, there was no statistical difference in the efficacy of biological agents, tofacitinib, and fmt. moreover, no treatments were found to increase the occurrence of adverse events when compared with placebos, except infliximab. however, vedolizumab seemed to reduce the occurrence of adverse events compared with infliximab.
conclusion: of the biological agents, vedolizumab and infliximab were the most effective, suggesting that biological agents are still a better choice. nevertheless, tofacitinib and fmt may be promising alternatives with high efficacies. however, more safety and maintenance studies need to be conducted in future for the acquisition of more accurate results.abbreviations: fmt: fecal microbiota transplantation; uc: ulcerative colitis; rcts: randomized controlled trials; ibd: inflammatory bowel disease; cd: crohn's disease; ibs: irritable bowel syndrome; cdi: clostridium difficile infections; itt: intention-to-treat; rr: relative risk; ci: confidence interval; cri: credible intervals; ifx: infliximab; ada: adalimumab; tfb: tofacitinib; glm: golimumab; vdz: vedolizumab; pbo: placebo; wk: week; f: female; m: male; aes: adverse events; saes: serious adverse events; anti-tnf: anti-tumor necrosis factors.",Zhou HY; Guo B; Lufumpa E; Li XM; Chen LH; Meng X; Li BZ,2021,Immunological investigations,50,4,323-337,10.1080/08820139.2020.1714650,"Zhou, H.

methods: the following electronic databases were systematically searched up to august 2020: medline (via pubmed), embase, cochrane central database of controlled trials (via central), google scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov.
results: data arising from pooled analysis, 7 in vitro/pharmacological studies, 7 clinical trials including 1 randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled, showed that the probiotic strain b. longum w11 has been extensively studied for its efficacy in subjects with ibs with constipation, leading to a significant reduction in symptoms. in particular, its role in alleviating constipation was also confirmed in subjects for whom a low-calorie weight-loss diet led to the slowing down of gut motility. the probiotic characteristics of b. longum w11 were further demonstrated in the treatment of minimal hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic disease. the most remarkable trait of b. longum w11 is its non-transmissible antibiotic resistance, due to a nucleotide polymorphism mutation in the rpob gene, making it resistant to antibiotics of the rifampicin group, including rifaximin. the co-administration of b. longum w11 and rifaximin in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease brought about a further significant improvement in the clinical condition compared to patients treated with rifaximin alone. b. longum w11 is a probiotic which could synergize with rifaximin as an adjuvant to antibiotic treatment.

36860849,modulation by luminal factors on the functions and migration of intestinal innate immunity.,"luminal antigens, nutrients, metabolites from commensal bacteria, bile acids, or neuropeptides influence the function and trafficking of immune cells in the intestine. among the immune cells in the gut, innate lymphoid cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, and innate lymphoid cells, play an important role for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis through a rapid immune response to luminal pathogens. these innate cells are influenced by several luminal factors, possibly leading to dysregulated gut immunity and intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and intestinal allergy. luminal factors are sensed by distinct neuro-immune cell units, which also have a strong impact on immunoregulation of the gut. immune cell trafficking from the blood stream through the lymphatic organ to lymphatics, an essential function for immune responses, is also modulated by luminal factors. this mini-review examines knowledge of luminal and neural factors that regulate and modulate response and migration of leukocytes including innate immune cells, some of which are clinically associated with pathological intestinal inflammation.",Higashiyama M; Miura S; Hokari R,2023,Frontiers in immunology,14,,1113467,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1113467,"Higashiyama, M., Miura, S., & Hokari, R.

37942144,functional changes of default mode network and structural alterations of gray matter in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis of whole-brain studies.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a brain-gut disorder with high global prevalence, resulting from abnormalities in brain connectivity of the default mode network and aberrant changes in gray matter (gm). however, the findings of previous studies about ibs were divergent. therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify common functional and structural alterations in ibs patients.
methods: altogether, we identified 12 studies involving 194 ibs patients and 230 healthy controls (hcs) from six databases using whole-brain resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) and voxel-based morphometry. anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping (aes-sdm) was used to identify abnormal functional and structural changes as well as the overlap brain regions between dysconnectivity and gm alterations.
results: findings indicated that, compared with hcs, ibs patients showed abnormal rs-fc in left inferior parietal gyrus, left lingual gyrus, right angular gyrus, right precuneus, right amygdala, right median cingulate cortex, and left hippocampus. altered gm was detected in the fusiform gyrus, left triangular inferior frontal gyrus (ifg), right superior marginal gyrus, left anterior cingulate gyrus, left rectus, left orbital ifg, right triangular ifg, right putamen, left superior parietal gyrus and right precuneus. besides, multimodal meta-analysis identified left middle frontal gyrus, left orbital ifg, and right putamen as the overlapped regions.
conclusion: our results confirm that ibs patients have abnormal alterations in rs-fc and gm, and reveal brain regions with both functional and structural alterations. these results may contribute to understanding the underlying pathophysiology of ibs.

38835657,exploration of the mechanism of traditional chinese medicine for anxiety and depression in patients with diarrheal irritable bowel syndrome based on network pharmacology and meta-analysis.,"background: the efficacy of chinese herbal medicine (chm) in managing irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (ibs-d) accompanied by anxiety and depression remains uncertain. thus, a systematic review was carried out employing meta-analysis and network pharmacology to ascertain the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of chm therapy.
methods: by conducting a systematic review, including literature search, screening, and data extraction, we identified 25 randomized controlled trials to assess chm's effectiveness in treating irritable bowel syndrome alongside anxiety and depression. network pharmacology was utilized to scrutinize the metabolite utility of chm in addressing this condition. potential primary mechanisms were synthesized using information sourced from the pubmed database.
results: twenty-five studies, including 2055 patients, were analyzed, revealing significant treatment efficacy for ibs-d in the trial group compared to controls [or = 4.01, 95% ci (2.99, 5.36), i2 = 0%] additionally, treatment for depression [smd = -1.08, 95% ci (-1.30, -0.86), p < 0.00001, i2 = 68%; sds: smd = -1.69, 95% ci (-2.48, -0.90), p < 0.0001, i2 = 96%] and anxiety [hama: smd = -1.29, 95% ci (-1.68, -0.91), p < 0.00001, i2 = 89%; sas: smd = -1.75, 95% ci (-2.55, -0.95), p < 0.00001, i2 = 96%] significantly improved in the trial group. furthermore, the trial group exhibited a significantly lower disease relapse rate [or = 0.30, 95% ci (0.20, 0.44), p < 0.00001, i2 = 0%]. chm treatment consistently improved ibs severity (ibs-sss) and symptom scores. network pharmacology analysis identified key chemical metabolites in traditional chinese medicine formulations, including beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, quercetin, naringenin, luteolin, kaempferol, nobiletin, wogonin, formononetin, and isorhamnetin. utilizing the string database and cytoscape v3.9.0 software, a protein-protein interaction (ppi) network revealed the top eight key targets: il-6, tnf, pparg, ptgs2, esr1, nos3, mapk8, and akt1, implicated in anti-inflammatory responses, antioxidant stress modulation, and neurotransmitter homeostasis maintenance.
conclusion: chinese herbal medicine (chm) offers a promising and safe treatment approach for patients dealing with diarrheal irritable bowel syndrome (ibs-d) accompanied by anxiety and depression; thus, indicating its potential for practical implementation. the most active metabolites of chm could simultaneously act on the pathological targets of ibs-d, anxiety, and depression.the diverse scope of chm's therapeutic role includes various aspects and objectives, underscoring its potential for broad utilization.",Bai C; Wang J; Wang Y; Liu H; Li J; Wang S; Bai Z; Guo R,2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,15,,1404738,10.3389/fphar.2024.1404738,"Bai, C., Wang, J., Wang, Y., Liu, H., Li, J., Wang, S., Bai, Z., & Guo, R.

aims: to determine improvement in ibs symptoms after mesalazine treatment, and the utility of measures of immune activity in the rectal mucosa methods: this was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicentre trial in subjects with ibs (rome iii criteria), with an eight-week treatment period of mesalazine 2400 mg or plcebo once-daily. the primary endpoint was the global assessment of satisfactory relief of ibs symptoms in ≥50% of weeks during intervention. ibs symptoms were also measured with the ibs severity scoring system; immune activity was measured by mucosal patch technology. a post hoc meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of mesalazine in ibs was added.
results: of 181 included patients, 91 received mesalazine and 90 received placebo. the primary endpoint was met by 32 (36%) patients after mesalazine and 27 (30%) after placebo (p = 0.40). there were no differences in response rates related to ibs subtype or post-infection symptom onset. more reduction of abdominal bloating was noted in the mesalazine group (p = 0.02). the meta-analysis showed no effect of mesalazine on ibs symptoms. no mucosal patch technology measure could predict response to mesalazine, and found no differences in the effects of intervention on levels of immune markers.

methods: a systematic search was performed on pubmed, embase, medline, cochrane library, cnki, wanfang, and cbm from database inception to march 2022. randomized controlled trials of irritable bowel syndrome in children were included in the study. the primary outcome was the placebo response rate of improvement.
results: thirteen studies were included, with 445 patients in the placebo group. the rate of improvement and abdominal pain disappearance were 28.2% (95% ci, 16.6-39.9%) and 5% (95% ci, 0-18.4%). the placebo response based on the abdominal pain score was 0.675 (95% ci, 0.203-1.147). the mode of administration (p < 0.01), dosing schedule (p < 0.01), and clinical outcome assessor (p = 0.04) have a significant impact on the magnitude of placebo effect.
conclusions: the placebo response rate for pediatric irritable bowel syndrome was 28.2%. in clinical trials, reducing dosing frequency, selecting appropriate dosage forms, and using patient-reported outcomes can help mitigate the placebo effect.
impact: this is the first meta-analysis to assess the placebo response rates for improvement and disappearance in children with ibs. the finding suggested that the mode of administration, dosing schedule, and clinical outcome assessor could potentially influence the magnitude of the placebo effect in children with ibs. this study would provide a basis for estimating sample size in clinical trial design with a placebo control.",Cai LL; Li X; Cai QH; Guo SX; Zhang Y; Sun WC; Zhao ZH; Hu SY,2024,Pediatric research,95,6,1432-1440,10.1038/s41390-023-02996-2,"Cai, L.

39166955,unraveling the genetic susceptibility of irritable bowel syndrome: integrative genome-wide analyses in 845 492 individuals: a diagnostic study.,"background: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) significantly impacts individuals due to its prevalence and negative effect on quality of life. current genome-wide association studies (gwas) have only identified a small number of crucial single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), not fully elucidating ibs's pathogenesis.
objective: to identify genomic loci at which common genetic variation influences ibs susceptibility.
methods: combining independent cohorts that in total comprise 65 840 cases of ibs and 788 652 controls, the authors performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (gwas) of ibs. the authors also carried out gene mapping and pathway enrichment to gain insights into the underlying genes and pathways through which the associated loci contribute to disease susceptibility. furthermore, the authors performed transcriptome analysis to deepen their understanding. ibs risk models were developed by combining clinical/lifestyle risk factors with polygenic risk scores (prs) derived from the gwas meta-analysis. the authors detect the phenotype association for ibs utilizing prs-based phenome-wide association (phewas) analyses, linkage disequilibrium score regression, and mendelian randomization.
results: the gwas meta-analysis identified 10 ibs risk loci, seven of which were novel (rs12755507, rs34209273, rs34365748, rs67427799, rs2587363, rs13321176, rs1546559). multiple methods identified nine promising ibs candidate gene ( prrc2a, cop1, cadm2, lrp1b, sugt1, med12l, p2ry14, phf2, shisa6 ) at 10 gwas loci. transcriptome validation also revealed differential expression of these genes. phenome-wide associations between prs-ibs and nine traits (neuroticism, diaphragmatic hernia, asthma, diverticulosis, cholelithiasis, depression, insomnia, copd, and bmi) were identified. the six diseases (asthma, diaphragmatic hernia, diverticulosis, insomnia major depressive disorder and neuroticism) were found to show genetic association with ibs and only major depressive disorder and neuroticism were found to show causality with ibs.

research questions: what mechanisms underlie the development of functional gastrointestinal complaints in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) and ibd? what therapeutic approaches arise from this?
materials and methods: narrative review.
results: the pathogenesis of ibs involves interactions between psychosocial factors, genetics, and microbiota as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems. the interplay between stress and visceral hypersensitivity is of central importance. therapeutically, lifestyle changes with stress reduction and exercise alongside dietary, pharmacological, and psychotherapeutic options are useful.

aims: to investigate the efficacy of een in adults with active ulcerative colitis and compare variations in treatment protocols, safety, tolerability and adherence.
methods: we conducted a systematic search of medline, embase, cochrane central, emcare, cinahl, web of science and trial registries for articles published from inception until july 21, 2024. we included all experimental and observational studies that described the use of een in adults with active ulcerative colitis. this review was registered on prospero (crd42022319584).
results: of 3273 articles screened, we included 10 studies (334 adults). overall, there was no difference between een and comparator for ulcerative colitis remission induction (median follow-up 14 days, risk ratio (rr) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.71-1.85; 2 studies). in acute severe ulcerative colitis, there was no difference between een and comparator for corticosteroid failure (rr 0.76, 95% ci 0.48-1.20; 2 studies) or risk of colectomy (rr 0.88, 95% ci 0.51-1.51, n = 2 studies) during index admission. the pooled discontinuation rate was 3% (95% ci 0-10; 9 studies). there was heterogeneity in trial design, methodology and assessment of outcomes.
conclusion: een was well tolerated with low therapy discontinuation in adults with active ulcerative colitis. however, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of een as an adjunctive therapy to standard of care. further, well-designed studies with reproducible methodology and endpoints are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness.

results: our analysis included 17 studies encompassing 21 trials with 17,428 participants. approximately 77.3% of participants were female, with a mean age of 45.4 years. race was reported in 95% of the trials, but only 35% disclosed ethnicity. white participants constituted the majority at 79.3%. hispanics accounted for only 5.9%. counties without trial sites had smaller average population sizes compared with trial and trial-adjacent counties. socioeconomic indicators such as poverty rates, median household income, educational attainment, and broadband internet access were lower in counties without trial sites, with higher average area deprivation index scores indicating greater deprivation.
discussion: the findings highlight significant disparities in ibs trial participation across race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds. this raises potential concerns about generalizability of trial outcomes and underscores the need for strategies to enhance inclusivity in clinical research.",Kerbage A; Loesch J; Hamza E; Khan S; Nero N; Simons M; Lembo A,2025,The American journal of gastroenterology,120,4,873-882,10.14309/ajg.0000000000003099,"Kerbage, A., Loesch, J., Hamza, E., Khan, S., Nero, N., Simons, M., & Lembo, A.

38981855,genetic evidence for the causal impact of insomnia on gastrointestinal diseases and the mediating effects of adiposity traits.,"background and aim: insomnia has been implicated in gastrointestinal diseases (gis), but the causal effect between insomnia and gis and underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
methods: by using the released summary-level data, we conducted a two-step mendelian randomization (mr) analysis to examine the relationship between insomnia and four gis and estimate the mediating role of candidate mediators. the first step was to investigate the causal association between insomnia and gis using univariable mr analysis. the second step was to estimate the mediation proportion of selected mediators in these associations using multivariable mr analysis. subsequently, results from different datasets were combined using the fixed-effect meta-analysis.
results: univariable mr analysis provided strong evidence for the causal effects of insomnia on four gis after bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, including peptic ulcer disease (pud) (odds ratio [or] = 1.15, 95% interval confidence [ci] = 1.10-1.20, p = 1.83 × 10-9), gastroesophageal reflux (gord) (or = 1.19, 95% ci = 1.16-1.22, p = 5.95 × 10-42), irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) (or = 1.18, 95% ci = 1.15-1.22, p = 8.69 × 10-25), and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) (or = 1.09, 95% ci = 1.03-1.05, p = 3.46 × 10-3). in the mediation analysis, body mass index (bmi) and waist-to-hip ratio (whr) were selected as mediators in the association between insomnia and pud (bmi: mediation proportion [95% ci]: 13.61% [7.64%-20.70%]; whr: 8.74% [5.50%-12.44%]) and gord (bmi: 11.82% [5.94%-18.74%]; whr: 7.68% [4.73%-11.12%]).

40529486,efficacy and safety of chinese botanical drug si shen wan in irritable bowel syndrome: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"background and objectives: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (fgids), characterized by complex pathogenesis, prolonged disease duration, frequent recurrence, and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. si-shen-wan (ssw), a renowned traditional chinese medicine formula, is widely recognized for its efficacy in managing gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea, and is commonly used to treat diarrhea-predominant ibs (ibs-d). this study utilized a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ssw in the treatment of ibs-d.
methods: a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (rcts) was conducted across seven databases from their inception to 31 october 2024. the analysis included outcomes such as efficacy rate, overall symptom score, abdominal pain score, diarrhea score, abdominal distension score, loss of appetite score, recurrence rate, and adverse events. meta-analyses were performed using either a random-effects or fixed-effects model. trial sequential analysis (tsa) was applied to estimate the sample size and validate the robustness of the meta-analysis.
results: a total of 34 rcts involving 2,976 participants met the inclusion criteria. the findings demonstrated that ssw alone (rr = 1.28; 95% ci: 1.21, 1.34; p < 0.00001) or combined with biomedicine (rr = 1.26; 95% ci: 1.18, 1.35; p < 0.00001) significantly improved treatment efficacy compared to biomedicine alone. ssw also reduced the overall symptom score (smd = -1.06; 95% ci: -1.50, -0.61; z = 4.66; p < 0.00001) and alleviated key symptoms, including abdominal pain (md = -0.66; 95% ci: -0.76, -0.56; z = 12.99; p < 0.00001), diarrhea (md = -0.69; 95% ci: -0.81, -0.56; z = 10.82; p < 0.00001), abdominal distension (md = -0.65; 95% ci: -1.06, -0.24; z = 3.13; p = 0.002), and loss of appetite (md = -0.55; 95% ci: -0.66, -0.44; z = 9.80; p < 0.00001). the recurrence rate was also significantly reduced (rr = 0.40; 95% ci: 0.29, 0.55; p < 0.00001). additionally, ssw combined with moxibustion-a traditional chinese medicine therapy integrating internal and external treatments-also further improved treatment outcomes (rr = 1.22; 95% ci: 1.08, 1.37; p = 0.0001). this combination effectively reduced abdominal pain (md = -0.42; 95% ci: -0.81, -0.04; z = 2.17; p = 0.03), diarrhea (md = -0.41; 95% ci: -0.64, -0.17; z = 3.41; p = 0.0006), abdominal distension (md = -0.40; 95% ci: -0.69, -0.11; z = 2.67; p = 0.008), and loss of appetite (md = -0.30; 95% ci: -0.49, -0.10; z = 2.93; p = 0.003). safety analysis revealed a high level of safety for ssw and ssw combined with moxibustion, with no serious adverse events reported in any of the included trials. tsa confirmed an adequate sample size for the primary outcome, supporting the efficacy of ssw in ibs-d treatment.
conclusion: ssw, either used alone or combined with moxibustion, is effective in alleviating ibs-d symptoms and reducing recurrence rates, making it a potentially beneficial intervention. however, certain limitations remain in the overall quality of the current studies, including relatively small sample sizes, insufficiently long follow-up periods, and the absence of a double-blind design. future research should emphasize the design and implementation of high-quality, long-term, randomized, double-blind clinical trials to further enhance the reliability and external applicability of the research findings.

36508920,combination therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: current evidence and perspectives.,"background and objective: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory diseases with a relapsing-remitting course, including ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). combination therapy has been proposed as a strategy to enhance treatment efficacy in ibd. the aim of this study is to summarize current evidence and perspectives on combination therapies in ibd.
methods: electronic databases such as pubmed, ovid embase, medline, and cochrane central were searched to identify relevant studies.
results: current evidence supports that the combination of infliximab and thiopurines is more effective than monotherapy in inducing and maintaining remission in ibd. data on the combination of other biological agents such as adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and immunosuppressors is lacking or showed conflicting results. vedolizumab seems a potentially effective maintenance regimen after calcineurin inhibitors-based rescue therapy in acute severe ulcerative colitis (asuc). dual targeted therapy, which is the combination of two biological agents and/or small molecules, might be a reasonable choice in patients with concomitant ibd and extraintestinal manifestations, or in patients with medical-refractory ibd who lack valid alternatives. some safety concerns such as adverse events (serious and opportunistic infections) and malignancies (lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer) were raised in combination therapies.
conclusions: combination therapies seem to be effective in some ibd patients such as refractory ibd patients or patients with extraintestinal manifestations, but it might be associated with an increased risk of adverse events and malignancies.",Dai C; Huang YH; Jiang M,2023,International immunopharmacology,114,,109545,10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109545,"Dai, C., Huang, Y.

methods: this initiative under the auspices of the international organization for the study of inflammatory bowel diseases (ioibd) began with a systematic literature search to evaluate the current evidence on the definition of disease progression in ibd. on october 22, 2019, a consensus meeting took place during the united european gastroenterology week (uegw) congress in barcelona, during which predefined proposed statements were discussed in a plenary session and voted on anonymously. agreement was defined as at least 75% of participants voting for any one statement.
results: the group agreed that the ultimate therapeutic goal in both cd and uc is to prevent disease impact on patient's life (health-related quality of life, disability, fecal incontinence), midterm complications (encompass bowel damage in cd, ibd-related surgery and hospitalizations, disease extension in uc, extraintestinal manifestations, permanent stoma, short bowel syndrome), and long-term complications (gastrointestinal and extraintestinal dysplasia or cancer, mortality).
conclusions: recommendations on which goals to achieve in disease-modification trials for preventing disease progression in patients with ibd are proposed by the spirit consensus. however, these recommendations will require validation in actual clinical studies before implementation in disease-modification trials.",Le Berre C; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2021,Gastroenterology,160,5,1452-1460.e21,10.1053/j.gastro.2020.10.065,"Le Berre, C., & Peyrin-Biroulet, L.

methods: independent genetic variants for depression and ibd were selected as instruments from published genome-wide association studies [gwas] among individuals of predominantly european ancestry. summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations were retrieved from three separate databases for both depression [psychiatric genomics consortium, finngen and uk biobank] and ibd [the largest gwas meta-analysis, finngen and uk biobank], respectively. mr analyses included the inverse-variance-weighted method, weighted-median estimator, mr-egger regression, and sensitivity analyses of steiger filtering and mr presso. from either direction, analyses were performed per outcome database and were subsequently meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model.
results: genetically predicted depression [per log-odds ratio increase] was associated with a higher risk of ibd; odds ratios [95% confidence interval] for ibd, cd and uc were 1.20 [1.05, 1.36], 1.29 [1.07, 1.56] and 1.22 [1.01, 1.47] in a combined sample size of 693 183 [36 507 ibd cases], 212 172 [13 714 cd cases] and 219 686 [15 691 uc cases] individuals, respectively. in contrast, no association was observed between genetically influenced ibd and depression in 534 635 individuals [71 466 depression cases].
conclusions: our findings corroborated a causal association of depression on ibd, which may impact the clinical decision on the management of depression in patients with ibd. though our results did not support a causal effect of ibd on depression, further investigations are needed to clarify the effect of ibd activity on depression [with different symptomology].",Luo J; Xu Z; Noordam R; van Heemst D; Li-Gao R,2022,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,16,4,633-642,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab191,"Luo, J., Xu, Z., Noordam, R., van Heemst, D., & Li-Gao, R.

methods: a systematic search was conducted in april 2022. studies were included if biologic initiation was compared between patients starting early (<3 years of diagnosis or top-down treatment) vs later (>3 years of diagnosis or step-up treatment). studies with <1 year of follow-up were excluded. the outcomes were colectomy and cd-related surgery for patients with uc and cd, respectively. random-effects analyses were conducted to compare rates of ibd surgery between early and late biologic treatment.
results: eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. three studies included patients with uc and 15 studies included patients with cd. in patients with cd, early biologic therapy was associated with lower odds of surgery (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.84) compared with late treatment. conversely, in patients with uc, the odds of colectomy were increased (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-6.30).

methods: medline, web of science, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched up to september 2023. primary outcomes were clinical remission and recurrence; secondary outcomes included endoscopic response and remission, and adverse events. we calculated odds ratios (or) using a random-effects model in r. the quality of systematic reviews was assessed using the amstar-2; the trials' risk of bias was evaluated using the cochrane collaboration tool. evidence certainty was rated using the grade framework.
results: out of 2613 results, 67 studies (22 systematic reviews and 45 rcts) met the eligibility criteria. in the updated meta-analysis, the or for clinical remission in uc and cd was 2.00 (95% ci 1.28-3.11) and 1.61 (95% ci 0.21-12.50), respectively. the subgroup analysis suggested that combining 5-asa and probiotics may be beneficial for inducing remission in mild-to-moderate uc (or 2.35, 95% ci 1.29-4.28). probiotics decreased the odds of recurrence in relapsing pouchitis (or 0.03, 95% ci 0.00-0.25) and trended toward reducing clinical recurrence in inactive uc (or 0.65, 95% ci 0.42-1.01). no protective effect against recurrence was identified for cd. multi-strain formulations appear superior in achieving remission and preventing recurrence in uc. the use of probiotics was not associated with better endoscopic outcomes. adverse events were similar to control. however, the overall certainty of evidence was low.

materials and methods: a systematic review of pubmed, scopus, and isi web of science databases was performed to retrieve all the studies addressing ibd-related predictors for work disability.
results: several factors have been suggested to predict work disability in the 15 revised investigations, although with not homogeneous results. having cd was reported as a significantly better predictor for permanent work disability compared to uc, maybe in relation to the generally more serious disease course. activity and severity of ibd, also indicated by the need for surgical treatment and comorbidities, was related to a significantly greater risk for work disability, although the exact role of other variables, i.e., specific symptoms, disease pattern and inflammatory parameters are still unclear. among demographic factors, a significant predictive role has been suggested for female gender.
conclusions: further research seems necessary to confirm the role of ibd related factors on work disability, and on other parameters of work impairment, i.e., absenteeism, presenteeism, activity and productivity loss. additionally, work disability should be evaluated in relation to specific occupational risk factors. overall, this may require a multidisciplinary approach aimed to achieve an adequate ibd clinical evaluation and management, an improvement of patients' psychosocial and professional well-being, while appropriately assessing and managing risks in the workplace.",Leso V; Gervetti P; Macrini MC; Russo F; Iavicoli I,2021,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,25,1,165-181,10.26355/eurrev_202101_24382,"Leso, V., Gervetti, P., Macrini, M.

methods: we searched medline, embase, cochrane central, and trials registries, including rcts in adults with or without ibd comparing higher with lower omega-3, omega-6 and/or total pufa intake for ≥ 24 weeks that assessed ibd-specific outcomes or inflammatory biomarkers.
results: we included 83 rcts (41,751 participants), of which 13 recruited participants with ibd. increasing lcn3 may reduce risk of ibd relapse (rr 0.85, 95% ci 0.72-1.01) and ibd worsening (rr 0.85, 95% ci 0.71-1.03), and reduce erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr, smd - 0.23, 95% ci - 0.44 to - 0.01), but may increase ibd diagnosis risk (rr 1.10, 95% ci 0.63-1.92), and faecal calprotectin, a specific inflammatory marker for ibd (md 16.1 μg/g, 95% ci - 37.6 to 69.8, all low-quality evidence). outcomes for alpha-linolenic acid, omega-6 and total pufa were sparse, but suggested little or no effect where data were available.
conclusion: this is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of rcts investigating long-term effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total pufa on ibd and inflammatory markers. our findings suggest that supplementation with pufas has little or no effect on prevention or treatment of ibd and provides little support for modification of long-term inflammatory status.",Ajabnoor SM; Thorpe G; Abdelhamid A; Hooper L,2021,European journal of nutrition,60,5,2293-2316,10.1007/s00394-020-02413-y,"Ajabnoor, S.

methods: we systematically searched the databases from inception to may 2018 that evaluated ibd activity. the methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies checklist. the extracted data were pooled using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve model. random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.
results: ten studies comprising 773 ibd patients were included in the meta-analysis. the pooled sensitivity and specificity values for assessing ulcerative colitis (uc) activity were 0.81 [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.64-0.92] and 0.82 (95% ci, 0.61-0.93), respectively. and the pooled sensitivity and specificity values for assessing crohn's disease (cd) activity were 0.82 (95% ci, 0.73-0.88) and 0.71 (95% ci, 0.63-0.78), respectively. the diagnostic performance of the fl assay in the uc patients appeared to be superior to that in the cd patients.

37520885,a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between advanced glycation end products ceceptor (rage) gene polymorphisms and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.,"background: in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), the advanced glycation end product receptor (rage) has been involved. ibd is classified into chron's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). the promoter gene of the rage gene was discovered to have had unique polymorphisms that increased its transcriptional activity. this study, therefore, used a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between the rage gene polymorphism and the risk of ibd.
methods: databases such as pubmed, scopus, and cochrane library were searched to identify the relationship between rage gene polymorphisms and ibd susceptibility. we identified three single nucleotide polymorphism (snps) (rage-429t/c, 374t/a, and g82s). the data were analyzed by revman 5.4.
results: four studies (932 cases/1366 controls) were included. the findings showed no relationship between rage -429t/c and -g82s polymorphisms and the risk of ibd in all genetic models significantly. tt genotype of rage -374t/a polymorphisms was related to increased cd risk (or=1.37; 95%ci=1.04-1.81; p=0.02), while ta genotype was determined to be a protective factor (or=0.75; 95%ci=0.57-0.99; p=0.04). in uc, a allele of rage -374t/a was related to increase risk (or=1.26; 95%ci=1.04-1.53; p=0.02), while t allele was determined to decrease risk (or=0.79; 95%ci= 0.65-0.96; p=0.02).
conclusions: our findings demonstrated that tt genotype and a allele of rage -374t/a polymorphisms were related to cd and uc risks, respectively, while the ta genotype and t allele possibly had a protective effect. rage -429t/c and rage -g82s polymorphisms were not related to increased ibd risk.",Febrinasari RP; Indah SP; Bastomy ER; Irving S; Azmiardi A; Pribadi RR; Simadibrata M; Sari Y,2023,Caspian journal of internal medicine,14,3,412-424,10.22088/cjim.14.3.41,"Febrinasari, R.

36807832,efficacy and safety of dual targeted therapy for partially or non-responsive inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review of the literature.,"background: dual targeted therapy (dtt) has emerged as an attractive therapeutic option for select patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) who are unable to achieve remission with biologic or small molecule monotherapy. we conducted a systematic review of specific dtt combinations in patients with ibd.
methods: we conducted a systematic search of medline, embase, scopus, cinahl complete, web of science core collection, and cochrane library to identify articles related to the use of dtt for the treatment of crohn disease (cd) or ulcerative colitis (uc) published before february 2021.
results: twenty-nine studies were identified comprising 288 patients started on dtt for partially or non-responsive ibd. we identified 14 studies with 113 patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and anti-integrin therapies (i.e., vedolizumab and natalizumab), 12 studies with 55 patients receiving vedolizumab and ustekinumab, nine studies with 68 patients receiving vedolizumab and tofacitinib, five studies with 24 patients receiving anti-tnf therapy and tofacitinib, six studies with 18 patients receiving anti-tnf therapy and ustekinumab, and three studies with 13 patients receiving ustekinumab and tofacitinib.

37528211,effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"background: the use of ustekinumab in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is off-label and the data are limited. we conducted a systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in pediatric ibd.
methods: we systematically searched pubmed, embase and cochrane databases for studies of ustekinumab in children and adolescents with ibd investigating clinical remission, clinical response, corticosteroid-free (cs-free) remission, endoscopic remission/response, or safety up to march 17, 2023. a random-effects model was used for calculating summary estimates.
results: eleven studies, comprising 370 patients were included. for crohn's disease (cd), the pooled clinical remission rates were 34% (73/204) at 8-16 weeks and 46% (60/129) at 1 year. the pooled cs-free clinical remission rates were 23% (10/44) at 8-16 weeks and 45% (42/96) at 1 year. for ulcerative colitis (uc)/ibd unspecified (ibd-u), the pooled cs-free clinical remission rates were 24% (6/25) at 26 weeks and 46% (16/35) at 1 year. endoscopic remission was found in 0-37.5% of cd and 63.6% of uc. serious adverse events were reported in 3.5% of patients. about one half of patients required reduction in dose intervals and 62.75% patients could continue ustekinumab therapy at 1 year or final visit.
conclusions: according to low-quality evidence mainly from cohort studies and case series, approximately one half of patients with cd and uc/ibd-u achieved remission at 1 year. ustekinumab has a reasonable safety profile and dose optimization is frequently required. data on the long-term benefit and high-quality evidence are still needed.",Fang S; Zhang S; Zhang C; Wang L,2023,Paediatric drugs,25,5,499-513,10.1007/s40272-023-00586-7,"Fang, S., Zhang, S., Zhang, C., & Wang, L.

38203373,selected cytokines and metalloproteinases in inflammatory bowel disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a collective term for two diseases: ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). there are many factors, e.g., genetic, environmental and immunological, that increase the likelihood of these diseases. indicators of ibds include extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). the aim of this review is to present data on the role of selected cytokines and metalloproteinases in ibd. in recent years, more and more transcriptomic studies are emerging. these studies are improving the characterization of the cytokine microenvironment inside inflamed tissue. it is observed that the levels of several cytokines are consistently increased in inflamed tissue in ibd, both in uc and cd. this review shows that mmps play a major role in the pathology of inflammatory processes, cancer, and ibd. ibd-associated inflammation is associated with increased expression of mmps and reduced ability of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps) to inhibit their action. in ibd patients in tissues that are inflamed, mmps are produced in excess and timp activity is not sufficient to block mmps. this review is based on our personal selection of the literature that was retrieved by a selective search in pubmed using the terms ""inflammatory bowel disease"" and ""pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases"" that includes systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials. the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of ibd is reviewed in terms of the role of the cytokines and metalloproteinases involved.",Sosna B; Aebisher D; Myśliwiec A; Dynarowicz K; Bartusik-Aebisher D; Oleś P; Cieślar G; Kawczyk-Krupka A,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,25,1,,10.3390/ijms25010202,"Sosna, B., Aebisher, D., Myśliwiec, A., Dynarowicz, K., Bartusik-Aebisher, D., Oleś, P., Cieślar, G., & Kawczyk-Krupka, A.

39203883,dairy consumption and inflammatory bowel disease among arab adults: a case-control study and meta-analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which includes ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), is a complex disease with increasing global incidence and prevalence. although dairy consumption has been linked to various chronic diseases, its relationship with ibd remains uncertain. additionally, there is a lack of data on this topic from arab countries. this study aimed to investigate the association between dairy consumption and ibd through a case-control study among arab populations, followed by a meta-analysis of available studies.
method: first, we used data from 158 uc patients, 244 cd patients, and 395 controls attending a polyclinic in riyadh, saudi arabia. all participants were aged ≥ 18 years. logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (95% cis) of uc and cd for individuals who reported the highest versus the lowest frequencies of dairy consumption. next, we conducted a meta-analysis, combining our results with those from other eligible studies after searching several databases. we used the i2 statistics to examine statistical heterogeneity across studies and the regression test for funnel plot asymmetry to assess publication bias.
results: the case-control study showed a negative association between frequent dairy consumption and uc (or (95% ci) = 0.64 (0.41, 1.00)) but not cd (or (95% ci) = 0.97 (0.65, 1.45)). in the meta-analysis, the highest frequencies of dairy consumption were negatively associated with both uc and cd: ors (95% cis) = 0.82 (0.68, 0.98) and 0.72 (0.59, 0.87), respectively. a moderate heterogeneity across studies was noticed in the uc meta-analysis (i2 = 59.58%) and the cd meta-analysis (i2 = 41.16%). no publication bias was detected.
conclusions: frequent dairy consumption could protect against the development of uc and cd, suggesting potential dietary recommendations in the context of ibd prevention.",Almofarreh AM; Sheerah HA; Arafa A; Al Mubarak AS; Ali AM; Al-Otaibi NM; Alzahrani MA; Aljubayl AR; Aleid MA; Alhamed SS,2024,Nutrients,16,16,,10.3390/nu16162747,"Almofarreh, A.

35166398,review article: emerging drug therapies in inflammatory bowel disease.,"background: the landscape of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) treatment is rapidly expanding with the development of new therapeutic options.
aim: to review the mechanisms of action and the available clinical trial data on emerging drug therapies for ibd.
methods: pubmed, medline and cochrane databases were queried up to july 2021 using keywords ""inflammatory bowel disease,"" ""ibd,"" ""crohn's disease,"" ""ulcerative colitis"" and ""trial,"" ""phase"" and ""study."" in addition, we manually reviewed the grey literature including clinical trial registries and abstracts from major gastroenterology conferences in 2020 and 2021 to include pertinent information.
results: in ulcerative colitis (uc), phase 2b and/or phase 3 studies met primary endpoints for s1p receptor agonists (estrasimod, ozanimod), anti-il-23 agent (mirikizumab), anti-lymphocyte trafficking agents (ontamalimab, subcutaneous vedolizumab), jak inhibitors (upadacitinib, filgotinib) and tlr9 agonist (cobitolimod). in crohn's disease (cd), anti-il-23 agents (risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab), jak inhibitors (upadacitinib, filgotinib) and anti-lymphocyte trafficking agents (ontamalimab, etrolizumab) met primary endpoints in randomised controlled clinical trials.
conclusion: several new ibd drug therapies have positive efficacy and safety data in early clinical trials, and there are several drugs in the therapeutic pipeline. as more treatments for cd and uc are approved for clinical use, research to assess predictors of response to therapy and head-to-head trials is needed to inform providers on how to best position therapeutic options for patients with ibd.",Grossberg LB; Papamichael K; Cheifetz AS,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,7,789-804,10.1111/apt.16785,"Grossberg, L.

31970610,systematic review: non-medical switching of infliximab to ct-p13 in inflammatory bowel disease.,"background and aims: biosimilar approval, such as inflectratm (ct-p13) for treating ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), has reduced direct drug costs. though clinicians are comfortable with biosimilar use in treatment-naïve patients, there are concerns in some jurisdictions that there are insufficient data from well-controlled trials to support non-medical switching. a systematic review, along with a critical assessment of the study design, was conducted to assess the potential impact of switching stable cd/uc patients from infliximab to ct-p13.
methods: a literature search using pubmed and abstracts/posters from 3 major gastroenterology conferences from 2014 to 2018 was completed. two individual reviewers extracted data from each relevant report and compiled it into evidence tables to facilitate descriptive analyses. key randomized trial and observational study designs were critically assessed to contextualize data relevance.
results: a total of 49 reports (3 randomized controlled trials, 40 observational trials, and 1 case series) were included. most studies revealed no efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns with non-medical switch. limitations of supporting data include a small number of randomized controlled trials; predominance of observational studies with varying outcome assessments and lack of appropriate controls; and scarcity of research on biosimilar switch long-term effects.
conclusions: the majority of studies suggested non-medical switch is safe. however, clinicians and regulatory bodies should be aware of differences and limitations in study designs when making inferences about the risks and benefits of switching stable ibd patients to biosimilars.",Bernard EJ; Fedorak RN; Jairath V,2020,Digestive diseases and sciences,65,8,2354-2372,10.1007/s10620-019-06036-0,"Bernard, E.

37830172,differences in the prevalence of uveitis between crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"purpose: uveitis is one of the ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) that is often overlooked and has been considered a sign of severe ibd. as typical subtypes of ibd, differences exist in the prevalence of uveitis between crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). our study systematically assessed differences in the prevalence of uveitis between cd and uc.
methods: the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines were used. we performed a systematic review of published literature from pubmed and embase on 30 march 2022. two investigators independently selected studies, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. either a fixed- or a random-effects model was used to calculate the risk ratio (rr), odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) depending on the heterogeneity of studies. sensitivity analysis was used to examine the heterogeneity by removing article by article, while subgroup analysis was conducted in accordance with various regions.
results: our study included data from 14 studies encompassing 115 854 participants. the prevalence of uveitis in ibd was estimated to be 2.38% (95% ci 1.60%-3.17%). the prevalence of uveitis in cd (3.27%, 95% ci 2.15%-4.39%) was significantly higher than in uc (1.60%, 95% ci 0.93%-2.27%; rr 1.76, 95% ci 1.39-2.22, p < 0.05). in subgroup analysis, a higher incidence of cd combined with uveitis was also observed in ibd patients residing in europe (rr 1.75, 95% ci 1.37-2.24).

38449867,diet-derived circulating antioxidants and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis.,"background: previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the impact of circulating antioxidants on the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). in this study, our intent was to investigate the causal relationship between circulating antioxidants and ibd using mendelian randomization (mr).
methods: instrumental variables for absolute circulating antioxidants (ascorbate, retinol, lycopene, and β-carotene) and circulating antioxidant metabolites (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, ascorbate, and retinol) were screened from published studies. we obtained outcome data from two genome-wide association study (gwas) databases, including the international inflammatory bowel disease genetics consortium (iibdgc, 14,927 controls and 5,956 cases for crohn's disease (cd), 20,464 controls and 6,968 cases for ulcerative colitis (uc), and 21,770 controls and 12,882 cases for ibd) and the finngen study (375,445 controls and 1,665 cases for cd, 371,530 controls and 5,034 cases for uc, and 369,652 controls and 7,625 cases for ibd). mr analysis was performed in each of the two databases and those results were pooled using meta-analysis to assess the overall effect of exposure on each phenotype. in order to confirm the strength of the findings, we additionally conducted a replication analysis using the uk biobank.
results: in the meta-analysis of the iibdgc and finngen, we found that each unit increase in absolute circulating level of retinol was associated with a 72% reduction in the risk of uc (or: 0.28, 95% ci: 0.10 to 0.78, p=0.015). the uc gwas data from the uk biobank also confirmed this causal relationship (or: 0.99, 95% ci: 0.97 to 1.00, p=0.016). in addition, there was suggestive evidence that absolute retinol level was negatively associated with ibd (or: 0.41, 95% ci: 0.18 to 0.92, p=0.031). no other causal relationship was found.
conclusion: our results provide strong evidence that the absolute circulating level of retinol is associated with a reduction in the risk of uc. further mr studies with more instrumental variables on circulating antioxidants, especially absolute circulating antioxidants, are needed to confirm our results.",Zou M; Liang Q; Zhang W; Liang J; Zhu Y; Xu Y,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1334395,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1334395,"Zou, M., Liang, Q., Zhang, W., Liang, J., Zhu, Y., & Xu, Y.

35379216,efficacy and safety of vedolizumab for pediatrics with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"background: vedolizumab use in pediatrics is still off-label and the data are limited. we conducted a systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
methods: pubmed, embase and cochrane databases were systematically searched for studies of vedolizumab in children and adolescents with ibd reporting clinical remission, response, corticosteroid-free (cs-free) remission, mucosal healing, or safety up to december 3rd 2021.
results: ten studies, comprising 455 patients were included. for cd, the pooled clinical remission rates were 25% (19/75) at 6 weeks, 28% (25/85) at 14 weeks, 32% (17/53) at 22 weeks, and 46% (43/92) at 1 year. for uc/ibd-u, the pooled clinical remission rates were 36% (25/70) at 6 weeks, 48% (52/101) at 14 weeks, 53% (24/45) at 22 weeks, and 45% (50/112) at 1 year. mucosal healing was found in 17%-39% of cd and 15%-34% of uc/ibd-u respectively. six percent of patients reported serious adverse events.
conclusions: according to low-quality evidence based on case series, approximately one-third and one-half of patients for cd and uc/ibd-u respectively achieved remission within 22 weeks, and about half of patients achieved remission at 1 year with reasonable safety profile. long-term benefit profile data and high quality evidence are still needed.",Fang S; Song Y; Zhang C; Wang L,2022,BMC pediatrics,22,1,175,10.1186/s12887-022-03229-x,"Fang, S., Song, Y., Zhang, C., & Wang, L.

33554939,infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"background/aim: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are a group of conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of all or part of the digestive tract and primarily includes ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). this review has as target to summarize the complicated correlation between ibd and infections, which can affect patients' quality of life and increase substantially morbidity and mortality rates.
results: scientific evidence in recent years shows a growing recognition of the phenomenon although the association between these two aspects is not definitively clear. despite the fact that our understanding of this linkage is still incomplete, it is easily deducible that infections can start whether it be the onset or the relapse of ibd. in addition to this, the course of the disease predisposes the patient to numerous infections caused by the drugs used to treat ibd and this also raises the risk of infection complications.
conclusions: clinical trials have demonstrated that the combined use of immunomodulating agents may increase the risk of new infections. the infections might be intensified by an insufficient vaccination of adults with ibd. physicians have to be aware of these risks and try to attenuate and treat them properly.

objectives: to evaluate the benefits and harms of vitamin d supplementation as a treatment for ibd.
search methods: we used standard, extensive cochrane search methods. the latest search date was jun 2023.
selection criteria: we included randomised controlled trials (rcts) in people of all ages with active or inactive ibd comparing any dose of vitamin d with another dose of vitamin d, another intervention, placebo, or no intervention. we defined doses as: vitamin d (all doses), any-treatment-dose vitamin d (greater than 400 iu/day), high-treatment-dose vitamin d (greater than 1000 iu/day), low-treatment-dose vitamin d (400 iu/day to 1000 iu/day), and supplemental-dose vitamin d (less than 400 iu/day).
data collection and analysis: we used standard cochrane methods. our primary outcomes were 1. clinical response for people with active disease, 2. clinical relapse for people in remission, 3. quality of life, and 4. withdrawals due to adverse events. our secondary outcomes were 5. disease activity at end of study, 6. normalisation of vitamin d levels at end of study, and 7. total serious adverse events. we used grade to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.
main results: we included 22 rcts with 1874 participants. study duration ranged from four to 52 weeks. ten studies enroled people with crohn's disease (cd), five enroled people with ulcerative colitis (uc), and seven enroled people with cd and people with uc. seventeen studies included adults, three included children, and two included both. four studies enroled people with active disease, six enroled people in remission, and 12 enroled both. we assessed each study for risk of bias across seven individual domains. five studies were at low risk of bias across all seven domains. ten studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain but with no areas of high risk of bias. seven studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and assessors. vitamin d (all doses) versus placebo or no treatment thirteen studies compared vitamin d against placebo or no treatment. we could not draw any conclusions on clinical response for uc as the certainty of the evidence was very low (risk ratio (rr) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.51 to 10.57; 1 study, 60 participants). there were no data on cd. there may be fewer clinical relapses for ibd when using vitamin d compared to placebo or no treatment (rr 0.57, 95% ci 0.34 to 0.96; 3 studies, 310 participants). the certainty of the evidence was low. we could not draw any conclusions on quality of life for ibd (standardised mean difference (smd) -0.13, 95% ci -3.10 to 2.83 (the smd value indicates a negligent decrease in quality of life, and the corresponding cis indicate that the effect can range from a large decrease to a large increase in quality of life); 2 studies, 243 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events for ibd (rr 1.97, 95% ci 0.18 to 21.27; 12 studies, 1251 participants; note 11 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. thus, the rr and cis were calculated from 1 study rather than 12). the certainty of the evidence was very low. high-treatment-dose vitamin d versus low-treatment-dose vitamin d five studies compared high treatment vitamin d doses against low treatment vitamin d doses. there were no data on clinical response. there may be no difference in clinical relapse for cd (rr 0.48, 95% ci 0.23 to 1.01; 1 study, 34 participants). the certainty of the evidence was low. we could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for ibd as the certainty of the evidence was very low (rr 0.89, 95% ci 0.06 to 13.08; 3 studies, 104 participants; note 2 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. thus, the rr and cis were calculated from 1 study rather than 3). the data on quality of life and disease activity could not be meta-analysed, were of very low certainty, and no conclusions could be drawn. any-treatment-dose vitamin d versus supplemental-dose vitamin d four studies compared treatment doses of vitamin d against supplemental doses. there were no data on clinical response and relapse. there were no data on quality of life that could be meta-analysed. we could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for ibd as the certainty of the evidence was very low (rr 3.09, 95% ci 0.13 to 73.17; 4 studies, 233 participants; note 3 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. thus, the rr and cis were calculated from 1 study rather than 4).
authors' conclusions: there may be fewer clinical relapses when comparing vitamin d with placebo, but we cannot draw any conclusions on differences in clinical response, quality of life, or withdrawals, due to very low-certainty evidence. when comparing high and low doses of vitamin d, there were no data for clinical response, but there may be no difference in relapse for cd. we cannot draw conclusions on the other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence. finally, comparing vitamin d (all doses) to supplemental-dose vitamin d, there were no data on clinical relapse or response, and we could not draw conclusions on other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence or missing data. it is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research on the basis of the findings of this review. future studies must be clear on the baseline populations, the purpose of vitamin d treatment, and, therefore, study an appropriate dosing strategy. stakeholders in the field may wish to reach consensus on such issues prior to new studies.",Wallace C; Gordon M; Sinopoulou V; Limketkai BN,2023,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,10,10,CD011806,10.1002/14651858.CD011806.pub2,"Wallace, C., Gordon, M., Sinopoulou, V., & Limketkai, B.

37724090,cytomegalovirus pneumonia in inflammatory bowel disease: literature review and clinical recommendations.,"aim: the objective was to elucidate the correlation between cmvp and immunosuppressive therapy in ibd patients, we hope this review could expand on the significance of cmv as an opportunistic pathogen and the potential impact on morbidity and mortality in ibd patients.
methods: records and clinical trajectories linked to cmvp in ibd patients were extracted from the pubmed database, irrespective of language barriers. the reference lists incorporated in these studies were manually inspected. conclusions were generated using straightforward descriptive analysis.
results: in total, 18 ibd patients, including crohn's disease (cd, 67%) and ulcerative colitis (uc, 33%), affected by cmvp were identified from 17 published articles. a minority of these patients (17%) exhibited active disease, whereas the majority (83%) presented with quiescent disease. fever (100%) and dyspnea (44%) emerged as the most prevalent clinical symptoms. all the patients had undergone immunosuppressive therapy. a significant proportion, up to 89%, had received thiopurine treatment prior to the cmvp diagnosis. interestingly, none of the patients were subjected to biological therapy. half of the patients manifested with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hlh). almost all patients (94%) were administered antiviral treatment and a substantial 83% experienced full recovery. immunosuppressive agents were either tapered or discontinued altogether. a subset of patients, 17%, suffered fatal outcomes.
conclusion: our findings underscore the need for heightened suspicion of cmvp in ibd patients who exhibit symptoms such as fever and dyspnea. during the covid-19 pandemic, cmvp should be considered a potential differential diagnosis. it was observed that cmvp primarily transpires during cd remission. azathioprine emerged as the predominant immunosuppressant linked to cmv reactivation. the prompt application of effective antiviral therapy can substantially enhance patient outcomes. cmv vaccine might serve as a viable prevention strategy.",Ren K; Yong C; Wang Y; Wei H; Zhao K; He B; Cui M; Chen Y; Wang J,2023,Infection and drug resistance,16,,6195-6208,10.2147/IDR.S420244,"Ren, K., Yong, C., Wang, Y., Wei, H., Zhao, K., He, B., Cui, M., Chen, Y., & Wang, J.

32994694,systematic review of the prevalence and development of osteoporosis or low bone mineral density and its risk factors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"background: the inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) are chronic, immune-mediated disorders of the digestive tract. ibd is considered to be a risk factor for developing osteoporosis; however current literature on this matter is inconsistent.
aim: to assess prevalence and development of osteoporosis and low bone mineral density (bmd), and its risk factors, in ibd patients.
methods: systematic review of population-based studies. studies were identified by electronic (january 2018) and manual searches (may 2018). databases searched included embase and pubmed and abstracts from 2014-2018 presented at the united european gastroenterology week, the european crohn's and colitis organisation congress, and digestive disease week were screened. studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated either the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia and/or risk factors for osteoporosis or low bmd in ibd patients. studies on children under the age of 18 were excluded. only population-based studies were included. all risk factors for osteoporosis and low bmd investigated in any included article were considered. study quality and the possibility of bias were analysed using the newcastle-ottawa scale.
results: twelve studies including 3661 ibd patients and 12789 healthy controls were included. prevalence of osteoporosis varied between 4%-9% in studies including both cd and uc patients; 2%-9% in studies including uc patients, and 7%-15% in studies including cd patients. among healthy controls, prevalence of osteoporosis was 3% and 10% in two studies. cd diagnosis, lower body mass index (bmi), and lower body weight were risk factors associated with osteoporosis or low bmd. findings regarding gender showed inconsistent results. cd patients had an increased risk for osteoporosis or low bmd over time, while uc patients did not. increased age was associated with decreased bmd, and there was a positive association between weight and bmi and bmd over time. great heterogeneity was found in the included studies in terms of study methodologies, definitions and the assessment of osteoporosis, and only a small number of population-based studies was available.
conclusion: this systematic review found a possible increase of prevalence of osteoporosis in cd cohorts when compared to uc and cohorts including both disease types. lower weight and lower bmi were predictors of osteoporosis or low bmd in ibd patients. the results varied considerably between studies.",Kärnsund S; Lo B; Bendtsen F; Holm J; Burisch J,2020,World journal of gastroenterology,26,35,5362-5374,10.3748/wjg.v26.i35.5362,"Kärnsund, S., Lo, B., Bendtsen, F., Holm, J., & Burisch, J.

39448963,risk of clostridioides difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients undergoing vedolizumab treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a chronic, relapsing condition wherein biologics have improved disease prognosis but introduced elevated infection susceptibility. vedolizumab (vdz) demonstrates unique safety advantages; however, a comprehensive systematic comparison regarding the risk of clostridioides difficile infection (cdi) between vedolizumab and alternative medications remains absent.
method: medline, embase, cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov registry were comprehensively searched. pooled estimates of cdi proportion, incidence, pooled risk ratio between ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), vedolizumab and other medications were calculated. data synthesis was completed in r using the package ""meta"".
results: of the 338 studies initially identified, 30 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. for cdi risk, the pooled proportion was 0.013 (95% ci 0.010-0.017), as well as the pooled proportion of serious cdi was 0.004 (95% ci 0.002-0.008). the comparative pooled risk ratios revealed: uc versus cd at 2.25 (95% ci 1.73-2.92), vedolizumab versus anti-tnf agents at 0.15 (95% ci 0.04-0.63) for uc and 1.29 (95% ci 0.41-4.04) for cd.
conclusion: the overall cdi risk in ibd patients exposed to vedolizumab was estimated to be 0.013. an increased risk of cdi was noted in uc patients receiving vedolizumab compared to those with cd. vedolizumab potentially offers an advantage over anti-tnf agents for uc regarding cdi risk, but not for cd.

aim: to ascertain the correlation of h pylori infection with ibd among children.
methods: the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association between h pylori infection and ibd in children. we searched databases including cochrane, embase, google scholar, pubmed, medline, and web of science to select relevant studies. ultimately, based on predetermined inclusion criteria, we included 6 studies that met the requirements. review manager and stata software were used to extract and analyze the data from the relevant studies. in the methods, we employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches for comprehensive analysis. qualitative analysis involved describing study designs, sample characteristics, and results, while quantitative analysis involved statistical tests such as calculating pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the association between h pylori infection and ibd in children. lastly, by combining the results of the individual studies, our objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between h pylori infection and ibd in children.
results: in totality, we involved 2236 participants that were recruited in 6 studies. we detected no significant difference in h pylori prevalence (9.8% vs 12.7%, p = .12) by comparing the children ibd group to controls. among the ibd children, we estimated odds ratio (or) of h pylori infection to 0.62 [(95% confidence interval (ci) of 0.34-1.12)]. in children suffering from ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn disease (cd), the h pylori infection rates were higher than in those with ibd-unclassified (ibdu).when analyzed stratified by disease of study design, in cd group [or = 1.42, 95% ci: 0.72-2.80)] (i2 = 0%, p = .64). but no significant difference in cd group.

methods: a narrative review methodology was performed. a literature search was conducted using pubmed, medline, and google scholar. studies on the relationship between ibd or bariatric surgery and the risk of kidney stone formation were included.
results: dietary composition has a critical role in urinary stone formation. nutritional factors such as fluid intake, dietary protein, carbohydrates, oxalate, and calcium contribute to the risk of stone formation. bowel-related malabsorptive conditions (ibd, after bariatric surgery, etc.) are associated with an increased risk of kidney stone formation due to metabolic and physiological changes such as hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and decreased fluid intake or absorption. while the risk is lower in restrictive bariatric surgeries, the risk of kidney stone formation increases, especially after malabsorptive procedures. dietary recommendations for these patients could profit alleviate urinary changes and reduce the risk of kidney stones.

38021365,therapeutic advancement in inflammatory bowel disease by incorporating plant-based diet.,"identification and recognition of the ubiquitous environmental factor are prerequisite for treatment and prevention of the disease. the biggest problem with current practice in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor for the disease. the incidence of ibd is associated with dietary transition from a traditional diet to the current (westernized) diet. prospective cohort studies and case-control studies indicate that the current diet is a risk factor for ibd. the current diet tends to cause gut microbial dysbiosis resulting in a pro-inflammatory state. therefore, we regard our current diet as this factor. even nutritionally balanced meals are unable to suppress relapse, particularly in crohn's disease (cd). therefore, we developed a plant-based diet (pbd) (lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet) to counter the current diet. by incorporating the pbd into practice, we achieved far better outcomes in both ulcerative colitis (uc) and cd in both the induction and quiescent phases compared to the current standard therapy. all patients were treated on an inpatient basis and provided with a pbd. cd is far more untenable than uc and is destined to follow a disabling course. therefore, infliximab was indicated in all patients with cd, but only in severe cases with uc. this infliximab and pbd as first-line (ipf) therapy broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics (around 30%): the remission rate was 96% (44/46) in cd and 76% (13/17) in severe uc. a pbd can induce remission without medication in approximately one-third of mild cases of uc. all patients were advised to adhere pbd after discharge. in cd, a relapse-free outcome was achieved in nearly a half of patients (52%) at 10-year follow-up without biologics or immunosuppressants. cumulative relapse rates for 51 initial episode cases of uc (18 mild, 30 moderate, 3 severe) at 1 and 5 years were 14% and 27%, respectively. we believe our assertion that the current diet is the ubiquitous environmental factor underlying ibd is correct and a pbd is right diet for the disease.",Chiba M; Tsuji T; Komatsu M,2023,Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,8,,38,10.21037/tgh-23-6,"Chiba, M., Tsuji, T., & Komatsu, M.

36295058,genetic aspects of micronutrients important for inflammatory bowel disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) are complex diseases whose etiology is associated with genetic and environmental risk factors, among which are diet and gut microbiota. to date, ibd is an incurable disease and the main goal of its treatment is to reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and improve nutritional status and the quality of life. patients with ibd usually suffer from nutritional deficiency with imbalances of specific micronutrient levels that contribute to the further deterioration of the disease. therefore, along with medications usually used for ibd treatment, therapeutic strategies also include the supplementation of micronutrients such as vitamin d, folic acid, iron, and zinc. micronutrient supplementation tailored according to individual needs could help patients to maintain overall health, avoid the triggering of symptoms, and support remission. the identification of individuals' genotypes associated with the absorption, transport and metabolism of micronutrients can modify future clinical practice in ibd and enable individualized treatment. this review discusses the personalized approach with respect to genetics related to micronutrients commonly used in inflammatory bowel disease treatment.",Dragasevic S; Stankovic B; Kotur N; Milutinovic AS; Milovanovic T; Stojkovic Lalosevic M; Stojanovic M; Pavlovic S; Popovic D,2022,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",12,10,,10.3390/life12101623,"Dragasevic, S., Stankovic, B., Kotur, N., Milutinovic, A.

34335253,natural anti-inflammatory compounds as drug candidates for inflammatory bowel disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) represents chronic recurrent intestinal inflammation resulting from various factors. crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) have been identified as the two major types of ibd. currently, most of the drugs for ibd used commonly in the clinic have adverse reactions, and only a few drugs present long-lasting treatment effects. moreover, issues of drug resistance and disease recurrence are frequent and difficult to resolve. together, these issues cause difficulties in treating patients with ibd. therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of ibd is of significance. in this context, research on natural compounds exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity could be a novel approach to developing effective therapeutic strategies for ibd. phytochemicals such as astragalus polysaccharide (aps), quercetin, limonin, ginsenoside rd, luteolin, kaempferol, and icariin are reported to be effective in ibd treatment. in brief, natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activities are considered important candidate drugs for ibd treatment. the present review discusses the potential of certain natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives in the prevention and treatment of ibd.",Duan L; Cheng S; Li L; Liu Y; Wang D; Liu G,2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,12,,684486,10.3389/fphar.2021.684486,"Duan, L., Cheng, S., Li, L., Liu, Y., Wang, D., & Liu, G.

39474330,intestinal ultrasonography diagnostic performance and feasibility in ibd during pregnancy: a systematic review and narrative synthesis.,"introduction: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), are associated to poor maternal and foetal outcomes during pregnancy, requiring a strict monitoring of the disease activity, preferably with non-invasive modalities. there are numerous data confirming intestinal ultrasonography (ius) accuracy and efficacy for the detection of ibd disease activity and complications, but data in pregnant ibd patients are scarce. we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and feasibility of ius to monitor ibd activity throughout pregnancy.
methods: a systematic literature review was performed to identify studies on the use of ultrasound modality in pregnant inflammatory bowel disease women from the date of inception until april 2024 using medline, cochrane library, embase, and isi web of science databases, with keywords including (1) ultrasound/ultrasonography, (2) pregnancy, and (3) ibd (cd and uc). additional relevant studies were identified from cross-referencing and hand-searches of references of the retrieved articles. we included fully published observational studies and abstracts.
results: overall, five studies have been selected from 264 citations. all studies were highly heterogeneous in the definition of disease activity as reference standard, ius protocols, and outcomes. two of them used a cut-off value of faecal calprotectin (fcp) >100 μg/g. in one of them, clinical scores were used when the fcp value was ≥100-249 μg/g and fcp ≥250 μg/g was considered as an active disease independently of clinical scores. only one study used a single reference standard with a harvey-bradshaw index (hbi) >4. across these 3 studies, results suggest a relatively good specificity (range 83-98%) but low sensitivity (range 33-84%) to detect disease's activity. only 1 study analysed ius performance in detecting remission with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 92% compared to the reference standard. the size of the uterus limits the visualization of the terminal ileum and the sigmoid from the second trimester and the third trimester, respectively. the evaluation of the rectum remains limited.

36694316,impact of vitamin d on the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"aim: to determine the impact of vitamin d on the occurrence and progression of intestinal disorders, the authors of this study have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
background: vitamin d regulates inflammation and immunity in association with reducing the disease symptoms of several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc), and colorectal cancer (crc). however, the exact role of vitamin d in the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases is unclear so far.
methodology: the relevant studies were searched in pubmed and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. the quality of full-text studies was assessed using national heart, lung, and blood institute (nih) scale. the study was conducted as per the prisma guidelines. the overall estimate was calculated in terms of risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval. the publication bias was assessed qualitatively using a funnel plot, and heterogeneity among studies was calculated using i2 statistics. all analyses were done using revman 5.0.
results: the overall risk ratio using random effect model was found to be 0.89 (0.70, 1.12), which indicates the non-significant role of vitamin d in the occurrence and development of intestinal diseases as compared to the non-vitamin d group. however, after exclusion of studies with low and high sample sizes, a significant reduction in intestinal diseases was observed in the vitamin d group as compared to the non-vitamin d group. further, no heterogeneity among the studies was observed.
conclusion: based on available evidence, vitamin d might play a significant role in the reduction of intestinal diseases; however, more studies with high sample sizes are required to draw a valid conclusion.",Liu J; Wang Y; Zou Y; Li C,2023,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,26,12,2247-2258,10.2174/1386207326666230123151617,"Liu, J., Wang, Y., Zou, Y., & Li, C.

methods: electronic databases including pubmed, the cochrane library, embase and web of science, and manual retrieval were conducted from inception to june 2020. two reviewers independently searched the above databases and selected the studies using prespecified standardized criteria. the newcastle-ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies, and this meta-analysis was completed by stata version 14.2.
results: a total of 12 cohort studies and 4 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. overall, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) were at significantly increased risk of renal cancer (rca) [standardized incidence ratio (sir): 1.53; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.25-1.80; i2=42.4%], but not at increased risk of prostate cancer (pca), bladder cancer (bca) and male genital cancer. in the subgroup analysis, cd patients had a significantly higher rca risk (sir: 1.95; 95% ci: 1.45-2.44; i2=39.9%). besides, cd patients seemed to be at borderline significantly increased risks of pca (sir: 1.07; 95% ci: 0.93-1.20; i2=15.1%) and bca (sir:1.19; 95% ci: 0.94-1.44; i2=0%), and uc patients seemed to be at borderline significantly increased risks of rca (sir:1.31; 95% ci: 0.94-1.67; i2=48.0%) and pca (sir: 1.13; 95% ci: 0.93-1.33; i2=73.5%). notably, we observed that ibd patients in eastern countries have significantly increased pca risk (sir: 2.66; 95% ci: 1.52-3.81; i2=13.6%), especially for uc patients (sir: 3.01; 95% ci: 1.75-4.27; i2=0.0%).
conclusions: our findings indicate that ibd patients with special reference to cd patients increase the risk of rca. besides, ibd patients in asian countries have significantly increased risk of pca, especially for uc patients. further studies are warranted to elucidate the potential mechanism of rca associated with ibd and the differences of the risk of urinary cancers between eastern and western countries.",Feng D; Yang Y; Wang Z; Wei W; Li L,2021,Translational andrology and urology,10,3,1332-1341,10.21037/tau-20-1358,"Feng, D., Yang, Y., Wang, Z., Wei, W., & Li, L.

36984772,incorporation of plant-based diet surpasses current standards in therapeutic outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease.,"there has been no study of the therapeutic effect of a plant-based diet (pbd) in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) except for our studies in japan. in this review, we describe the rationale for the requirement of pbd in ibd and the outcomes of our modality incorporating pbd together with a literature review. the biggest problem in current therapy for ibd is the lack of a widely appreciated ubiquitous environmental factor in ibd. therefore, a radical strategy against ibd has not been established. japanese data showed an increased incidence of ibd in association with dietary westernization. current global consumption consists of an excess of unhealthy foods and a shortage of healthy foods recognized as pro-inflammatory. patients with ibd are no exception. one of the recommended healthy reference diets is pbd recognized as anti-inflammatory. we assert that ibd occurs in susceptible individuals mainly as a result of our omnivorous (westernized) diet. therefore, we developed and began to provide a pbd, a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for ibd patients in 2003. infliximab and pbd as first-line (ipf) therapy was administered for all patients with newly developed crohn's disease (cd) and for severe ulcerative colitis (uc). our modality broke the barrier of primary nonresponders to biologics, with a remission rate of 96% in cd, and created a new relapse-free course in slightly over half of the patients (52%) with cd. based on the rationale derived from available evidence and the clinical outcomes, pbd is highly recommended for ibd.",Chiba M; Morita N,2023,Metabolites,13,3,,10.3390/metabo13030332,"Chiba, M., & Morita, N.

objectives: a dose-response meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between upf intake and the risk of ibd.
data sources: searches were performed in the pubmed, isi web of science, and scopus databases up to november 2, 2022.
data extraction: data were available from 24 studies including a total of 4 035 694 participants from 20 countries.
data analysis: risk ratios for ibd were analyzed by a random-effects model. outcomes indicated that upf intake was linked to an increased risk of ibd (relative risk [rr], 1.13; 95%ci, 1.06-1.21; p = 0.001; i2 = 73.2%; n = 59; n = 4 035 694). this association was significant, especially for the risk of crohn's disease (cd) (rr, 1.19; 95%ci, 1.00-1.41; i2 = 78.2%; p = 0.046; n = 23; n = 2 167 160), unlike the risk of ulcerative colitis (uc) (rr = 1.11; 95%ci, 0.99-1.26; p = 0.085; i2 = 60.3%; n = 27; n = 2 167 918). also, results revealed that each 10% enhancement in daily upf intake was not related to the risk of ibd (rr, 1.05; 95%ci, 0.98-1.14; p = 0.168; i2 = 31.9%; n = 4) or the risk of uc (rr, 1.01; 95%ci, 0.92-1.11; p = 0.876; i2 = 34.7%; n = 2) in adults. however, results suggested that for every 10% increase in daily upf intake, there was a 19% increase in the risk of cd (rr, 1.19; 95%ci, 1.01-1.32; p = 0.021; i2 = 0.0%; n = 2) among adults. in addition, the results showed a positive linear relation between upf intake with cd risk (pnonlinearity = 0.431; pdose response = 0.049) but not risk of ibd or uc.

methods: using data obtained from the clarify registry, a prospective study of no-charge coronary artery calcium (cac) testing at university hospitals, we reviewed patients with ulcerative colitis (uc) or crohn's disease (cd) who underwent cac scoring from 2014 to 2020. we investigated the concordance between cac risk and 10-year estimated ascvd risk by aha/acc pooled cohort equation using pre-established thresholds for statin prescription (cac≥100, 10-year ascvd risk ≥7.5%). we additionally investigated the association between cac, preventive therapy initiation and major adverse cardiovascular events (mace).
results: a total of 369 patients with ibd were included (174 uc, 195 cd), with median age of 60 years. the median cac score was 14.9 with no significant difference between uc and cd (p = .76). overall, 151 (41%) had cac of 0, 108 (29%) had cac 1-99, 61 (17%) had cac 100 to 399, and 49 (13%) had cac ≥400 with no difference in cac distribution between cd and uc (p = .17). there was no difference in median cac between ibd or age/sex-matched controls (p = .34). approximately half of the patients (52%) with ibd had 10-year estimated ascvd risk of 7.5% or higher. among patients with ascvd risk <7.5% (n = 163), 29 (18%) had cac≥100 and among patients with ascvd risk ≥7.5% (n = 178), 102 (57%) had cac <100. there was no difference between cac<100 vs cac≥100 with respect to crp, use of immunosuppressive or amino-salicylate therapy, ibd severity or complications. cac score (auroc 0.67 [0.56-0.78]), but not pce ascvd risk (auroc 0.60 [0.48-0.73]), was predictive of mace. the best cut-off for cac score was 76 (sensitivity = 60%, specificity = 69%), and was associated with 4-fold increase in mace (hazard ratio 4.0 [2.0-8.1], p < .001).

38764499,origin and function of monocytes in inflammatory bowel disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), is a chronic disease resulting from the interaction of various factors such as social elements, autoimmunity, genetics, and gut microbiota. alarmingly, recent epidemiological data points to a surging incidence of ibd, underscoring an urgent imperative: to delineate the intricate mechanisms driving its onset. such insights are paramount, not only for enhancing our comprehension of ibd pathogenesis but also for refining diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms. monocytes, significant immune cells derived from the bone marrow, serve as precursors to macrophages (mφs) and dendritic cells (dcs) in the inflammatory response of ibd. within the ibd milieu, their role is twofold. on the one hand, monocytes are instrumental in precipitating the disease's progression. on the other hand, their differentiated offsprings, namely momφs and modcs, are conspicuously mobilized at inflammatory foci, manifesting either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory actions. the phenotypic spectrum of these effector cells, intriguingly, is modulated by variables such as host genetics and the subtleties of the prevailing inflammatory microenvironment. notwithstanding their significance, a palpable dearth exists in the literature concerning the roles and mechanisms of monocytes in ibd pathogenesis. this review endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap. it offers an exhaustive exploration of monocytes' origin, their developmental trajectory, and their differentiation dynamics during ibd. furthermore, it delves into the functional ramifications of monocytes and their differentiated progenies throughout ibd's course. through this lens, we aspire to furnish novel perspectives into ibd's etiology and potential therapeutic strategies.",Liao X; Liu J; Guo X; Meng R; Zhang W; Zhou J; Xie X; Zhou H,2024,Journal of inflammation research,17,,2897-2914,10.2147/JIR.S450801,"Liao, X., Liu, J., Guo, X., Meng, R., Zhang, W., Zhou, J., Xie, X., & Zhou, H.

methods: we searched medline, embase, and the cochrane library from inception to december 2023 for phase 2 and 3 rcts of advanced therapies in ibd.
results: one hundred forty-four studies were included, 72 in uc and 72 in cd, published between 1997 and 2023. in uc, 64% (46/72) rcts reported mh as an endpoint. 12 definitions of mh were found, from endoscopic assessment alone (35/46; 76%) to the more recent combination of histology and endoscopy (10/46; 22%). 96% (44/46) of studies used the mayo endoscopic subscore. in cd, reporting of mh lagged behind uc, with only 12% (9/72) of trials specifically defining mh as an endpoint, 7 as ""absence of ulceration,"" 2 as simplified endoscopic score for cd score ≤2 or 0. histological assessment was performed in 3 rcts of cd. centralized reading of endoscopy was used in 48% (35/72) of rcts of uc and 22% (16/72) of cd. only 1 rct included transmural healing as an endpoint.
conclusions: a standard definition of mh in ibd is lacking. definitions have evolved particularly in uc, which now includes the addition of histological evaluation. transmural healing holds promise as a future target in cd. we support a greater standardization of definitions as we expect endpoints to become increasingly stringent and multimodal with computers automating the assessment.",Parigi TL; Solitano V; Armuzzi A; Barreiro de Acosta M; Begun J; Ben-Horin S; Biedermann L; Colombel JF; Dignass A; Fumery M; Ghosh S; Kobayashi T; Louis E; Magro F; Panaccione R; Rausch A; Reinisch W; Selinger C; Jairath V; Danese S; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2024,United European gastroenterology journal,12,9,1266-1279,10.1002/ueg2.12671,"Parigi, T.

35111772,epidemiology and risk factors of portal venous system thrombosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) may be at risk of developing portal venous system thrombosis (pvst) with worse outcomes. this study aims to explore the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of pvst among patients with ibd.
methods: pubmed, embase, and cochrane library databases were searched. all the eligible studies were divided according to the history of colorectal surgery. only the prevalence of pvst in patients with ibd was pooled if the history of colorectal surgery was unclear. the incidence of pvst in patients with ibd after colorectal surgery was pooled if the history of colorectal surgery was clear. prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of pvst were pooled by only a random-effects model. subgroup analyses were performed in patients undergoing imaging examinations. odds ratios (ors) with 95% cis were calculated.
results: a total of 36 studies with 143,659 patients with ibd were included. among the studies where the history of colorectal surgery was unclear, the prevalence of pvst was 0.99, 1.45, and 0.40% in ulcerative colitis (uc), crohn's disease (cd), and unclassified ibd, respectively. among the studies where all the patients underwent colorectal surgery, the incidence of pvst was 6.95, 2.55, and 3.95% in uc, cd, and unclassified ibd after colorectal surgery, respectively. both the prevalence and incidence of pvst became higher in patients with ibd undergoing imaging examinations. preoperative corticosteroids therapy (or = 3.112, 95% ci: 1.017-9.525; p = 0.047) and urgent surgery (or = 1.799, 95% ci: 1.079-2.998; p = 0.024) are significant risk factors of pvst in patients with ibd after colorectal surgery. the mortality of patients with ibd with pvst after colorectal surgery was 4.31% (34/789).
conclusion: pvst is not rare, but potentially lethal in patients with ibd after colorectal surgery. more severe ibd, indicated by preoperative corticosteroids and urgent surgery, is associated with a higher risk of pvst after colorectal surgery. therefore, screening for pvst by imaging examinations and antithrombotic prophylaxis in high-risk patients should be actively considered.

methods: a systematic review was conducted using medline, scopus, and embase [until march 2022] to identify studies assessing fertility and assisted reproductive technologies outcomes in women with non-operated ibd, compared with non-ibd patients. two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted study data.
results: a total of 14 studies encompassing 18 012 patients with ulcerative colitis [uc] and 14 353 patients with crohn's disease [cd] were included for analysis. the fertility rate in uc patients and in the general population was comparable, but uc patients tended to have fewer children, mainly by choice. on the contrary, the fertility of cd patients appeared to be reduced. although a deliberate component cannot be not excluded, the disease itself could affect fertility. disease activity was associated with reduced fertility in both uc and cd patients. in cd, the colonic involvement of the disease and perianal damage could be associated with subfertility, but data are less consistent. according to the only study reporting the assisted reproductive technologies outcomes, pregnancy rates after in vitro fertilization in subfertile non-operated uc patients and non-ibd patients were similar.
conclusions: there is low-quality evidence from observational studies that patients with cd and relapsing uc may have impaired fertility. after assisted reproductive technologies, pregnancy rates of subfertile non-operated uc patients were similar to those of the general population, although this observation requires further scrutiny in larger studies that should include uc and cd patients.",Vieujean S; De Vos M; Paridaens K; Daftary GS; Danese S; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,4,614-632,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac170,"Vieujean, S., De Vos, M., Paridaens, K., Daftary, G.

methods: we systematically searched the databases for studies from inception to april 2020 that evaluated mh in ibd. the methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies checklist. the extracted data were pooled using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve model. random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.
results: sixteen studies comprising 1,682 ulcerative colitis (uc) patients and 4 studies comprising 221 crohn's disease (cd) patients were included. the best performance of fc for predicting mh in uc was at cut-off range of 60-75 μg/g with area under the curve (auc) of 0.88 and pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. the pooled sensitivity and specificity values of cutoff range 180-250 μg/g for predicting mh in cd were 0.67 and 0.76, respectively. the auc of 0.79 also revealed improved discrimination for identifying mh in cd with fc concentration.

37298350,exploring the impact of cyanidin-3-glucoside on inflammatory bowel diseases: investigating new mechanisms for emerging interventions.,"cyanidin-3-o-glucoside (c3g), the most widely distributed anthocyanin (acn) in edible fruits, has been proposed for several bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, antimicrobial, anti-viral, anti-thrombotic and epigenetic actions. however, habitual intake of acns and c3g may vary widely among populations, regions, and seasons, among individuals with different education and financial status. the main point of c3g absorption occurs in the small and large bowel. therefore, it has been supposed that the treating properties of c3g might affect inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), such as ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). ibds develop through complex inflammatory pathways and sometimes may be resistant to conventional treatment strategies. c3g presents antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and antimicrobial effects useful for ibd management. in particular, different studies have demonstrated that c3g inhibits nf-κb pathway activation. in addition, c3g activates the nrf2 pathway. on the other hand, it modulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes and cytoprotective proteins, such as nad(p)h, superoxide dismutase, heme-oxygenase (ho-1), thioredoxin, quinone reductase-oxide 1 (nqo1), catalase, glutathione s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. interferon i and ii pathways are downregulated by c3g inhibiting interferon-mediating inflammatory cascades. moreover, c3g reduces reactive species and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as c reactive protein, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (il)-5, il-9, il-10, il-12p70, and il-17a in uc and cd patients. finally, c3g modulates gut microbiota by inducing an increase in beneficial gut bacteria and increasing microbial abundances, thus mitigating dysbiosis. thus, c3g presents activities that may have potential therapeutic and protective actions against ibd. still, in the future, clinical trials should be designed to investigate the bioavailability of c3g in ibd patients and the proper therapeutic doses through different sources, aiming to the standardization of the exact clinical outcome and efficacy of c3g.",Frountzas M; Karanikki E; Toutouza O; Sotirakis D; Schizas D; Theofilis P; Tousoulis D; Toutouzas KG,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,11,,10.3390/ijms24119399,"Frountzas, M., Karanikki, E., Toutouza, O., Sotirakis, D., Schizas, D., Theofilis, P., Tousoulis, D., & Toutouzas, K.

34201630,role of intestinal ultrasound in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"intestinal ultrasound (ius) has gained popularity as a first line technique for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) due to its many advantages. it is a non-invasive imaging technique with non-ionizing radiation exposure. it can be easily performed not only by radiologists but also by trained gastroenterologists at outpatient clinics. in addition, the cost of ius equipment is low when compared with other imaging techniques. ius is an accurate technique to detect inflammatory lesions and complications in the bowel in patients with suspected or already known crohn's disease (cd). recent evidence indicates that ius is a convenient and accurate technique to assess extension and activity in the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc), and can be a non-invasive alternative to endoscopy. in patients with ibd, several non-specific pathological ultrasonographic signs can be identified: bowel wall thickening, alteration of the bowel wall echo-pattern, loss of bowel stratification, increased vascularization, decreased bowel peristalsis, fibro-fatty proliferation, enlarged lymph nodes, and/or abdominal free fluid. considering the transmural cd inflammation, cd complications such as presence of strictures, fistulae, or abscesses can be detected. in patients with uc, where inflammation is limited to mucosa, luminal inflammatory ultrasonographic changes are similar to those of cd. as the technique is related to the operator's experience, adequate ius training, performance in daily practice, and a generalized use of standardized parameters will help to increase its reproducibility.",Jauregui-Amezaga A; Rimola J,2021,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",11,7,,10.3390/life11070603,"Jauregui-Amezaga, A., & Rimola, J.

33614645,vedolizumab: potential mechanisms of action for reducing pathological inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), encompassing ulcerative colitis (uc), and crohn's disease (cd), are a group of disorders characterized by chronic, relapsing, and remitting, or progressive inflammation along the gastrointestinal tract. ibd is accompanied by massive infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the intestinal mucosa. leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and t-cells are recruited to the affected site, exacerbating inflammation and causing tissue damage. current treatments used to block inflammation in ibd include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics. the first successful biologic, which revolutionized ibd treatment, targeted the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfα). infliximab, adalimumab, and other anti-tnf antibodies neutralize tnfα, preventing interactions with its receptors and reducing the inflammatory response. however, up to 40% of people with ibd become unresponsive to anti-tnfα therapy. thus, more recent biologics have been designed to block leukocyte trafficking to the inflamed intestine by targeting integrins and adhesins. for example, natalizumab targets the α4 chain of integrin heterodimers, α4β1 and α4β7, on leukocytes. however, binding of α4β1 is associated with increased risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, an often-fatal disease, and thus, it is not used to treat ibd. to target leukocyte infiltration without this life-threatening complication, vedolizumab was developed. vedolizumab specifically targets the α4β7 integrin and was approved to treat ibd based on the presumption that it would block t-cell recruitment to the intestine. though vedolizumab is an effective treatment for ibd, some studies suggest that it may not block t-cell recruitment to the intestine and its mechanism(s) of action remain unclear. vedolizumab may reduce inflammation by blocking recruitment of t-cells, or pro-inflammatory monocytes and dendritic cells to the intestine, and/or vedolizumab may lead to changes in the programming of innate and acquired immune cells dampening down inflammation.",Luzentales-Simpson M; Pang YCF; Zhang A; Sousa JA; Sly LM,2021,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,9,,612830,10.3389/fcell.2021.612830,"Luzentales-Simpson, M., Pang, Y.

34513862,rules of engagement: epithelial-microbe interactions and inflammatory bowel disease.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), are complex, multifactorial disorders that lead to chronic and relapsing intestinal inflammation. the exact etiology remains unknown, however multiple factors including the environment, genetic, dietary, mucosal immunity, and altered microbiome structure and function play important roles in disease onset and progression. supporting this notion that the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in ibd pathogenesis, studies in gnotobiotic mice have shown that mouse models of intestinal inflammation require a microbial community to develop colitis. additionally, antimicrobial therapy in some ibd patients will temporarily induce remission further demonstrating an association between gut microbes and intestinal inflammation. finally, a dysfunctional intestinal epithelial barrier is also recognized as a key pathogenic factor in ibd. the intestinal epithelium serves as a barrier between the luminal environment and the mucosal immune system and guards against harmful molecules and microorganisms while being permeable to essential nutrients and solutes. beneficial (i.e., mutualists) bacteria promote mucosal health by strengthening barrier integrity, increasing local defenses (mucin and iga production) and inhibiting pro-inflammatory immune responses and apoptosis to promote mucosal homeostasis. in contrast, pathogenic bacteria and pathobionts suppress expression and localization of tight junction proteins, cause dysregulation of apoptosis/proliferation and increase pro-inflammatory signaling that directly damages the intestinal mucosa. this review article will focus on the role of intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) and the luminal environment acting as mediators of barrier function in ibd. we will also share some of our translational observations of interactions between iecs, immune cells, and environmental factors contributing to maintenance of mucosal homeostasis, as it relates to gi inflammation and ibd in different animal models.",Jergens AE; Parvinroo S; Kopper J; Wannemuehler MJ,2021,Frontiers in medicine,8,,669913,10.3389/fmed.2021.669913,"Jergens, A.

40662074,effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological therapies for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: a network meta-analysis.,"background: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), encompassing both crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), is a chronic, inflammatory, and immune-mediated disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. if left inadequately treated, ibd can lead to disease progression, resulting in severe long-term complications, including irreversible structural damage to the intestinal tissues. while clinical symptoms are traditionally used to assess treatment efficacy, they do not always align with the underlying mucosal inflammation, particularly in cd. this limitation underscores the importance of exploring alternative treatment strategies. to address this gap, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments (npts) for ibd through a network meta-analysis (nma), providing a thorough assessment of the available evidence.
methods: we systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (rcts) from the following databases: pubmed, embase, springer, cochrane controlled register of trials (central), and web of science, comparing various npts for ibd, including cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), diet interventions (di), fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt), physical training (pt), and acupuncture and moxibustion (apmx). outcomes assessed included clinical remission, disease activity, quality of life (qol), serum biomarkers (fecal calprotectin [fc] and c-reactive protein [crp]), and adverse effects. the quality assessment was assessed by cochrane handbook and gradepro software. the risk ratio (rr) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes while standardized mean difference (smd) was used for continuous variables with 95% credible intervals (ci). funnel plot was performed to evaluate publication bias. surface under the cumulative ranking curve (sucra) was conducted to rank the included interventions. data were analyzed with stata 15.0 and review manager 5.3.
results: a total of 62 eligible rcts were identified in this nma. the results showed that standard medical therapy (smt) exhibited the highest probability in inducing clinical remission, as expected. among non-pharmacological interventions, apmx, a traditional chinese medicine involving acupuncture and moxibustion, showed promising results in both animal models and clinical trials, reducing serum tnf-α levels and improving intestinal health. di was most effective in maintaining clinical remission and reducing serum fc levels. fmt emerged as the most effective treatment for reducing serum crp levels and ranked second in terms of clinical remission induction.
conclusion: apmx, di, and fmt represent promising non-pharmacological options for managing ibd. apmx was the most effective for clinical remission and symptom relief, while di was best for maintaining remission, and fmt showed promise in reducing inflammation. further high-quality clinical trials are needed to strengthen the evidence and guide clinical practice in ibd management.

methods: the analysis employed a random-effects model to assess the standardized mean difference (smd) with a 95% confidence interval. a literature search was conducted in databases from 2014 to 20 july 2024 to identify studies investigating scfas in ibd.
results: subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction in fecal scfa levels-specifically butyrate, acetate, and propionate-in all ibd subgroups compared to healthy controls. active ibd showed a greater decrease in butyrate (p = 0.004), and uc showed a notable reduction in propionate (p = 0.03). when comparing uc and cd, differences were observed mainly in propionate (smd = -0.76, p = 0.00001). dietary interventions in ibd patients led to increased scfa levels, with butyrate showing the most improvement (smd = 1.03), suggesting the potential therapeutic value of dietary modulation.

methods: a comprehensive search was conducted in the pubmed, embase, web of science, and cochrane databases, with the last search date being october 2024. baseline values of nlr, plr, and lmr during active and remission phases, as well as moderate and severe conditions, were analyzed as primary endpoints in patients with ibd compared to healthy populations, using risk ratios (wmd) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (ci) estimates.
results: twenty-three cohort studies involving 3550 ibd patients and 1010 healthy people were finally included in this meta-analysis. the results of the meta-analysis showed that peripheral serum nlr and plr were significantly higher in ibd patients than in the healthy population nlr [wmd=1.57,95%ci(1.14,2.01),p<0.001], plr [wmd=60.66,95%ci(51.68,69.64),p<0.001]; nlr in active versus remission stage of ibd, plr, lmr had significant differences nlr [wmd=1.50,95%ci(1.23,1.78),p<0.001], plr [wmd=69.02,95%ci(39.66,98.39,p<0.001], lmr [wmd=-1.14,95%ci(-1.43,-0.86,p<0.001]; ibd active period and remission period nlr, plr and lmr had significant differences. 0.001]; there were significant differences in nlr and plr between moderate and severe ibd nlr [wmd=-1.41,95%ci(-2.13,-0.69),p<0.001], plr [wmd=-112.03,95%ci(-143.87,-80.19),p<0.001]; the diagnostic accuracy of markers in predicting the clinical activity of ibd was relatively good. the diagnostic accuracy of markers in predicting ibd clinical activity was more favorable auc [es=0.72,95%ci(0.69,0.75),p<0.001].
conclusion: in patients with ibd, elevated nlr and plr are associated with increased disease activity and severity in uc and cd. conversely, an elevated lmr is linked to reduced disease activity in ibd. based on diagnostic accuracy results, inflammatory markers nlr and plr serve as effective biomarkers for assessing ibd activity, thereby providing valuable insights for treatment decisions in ibd patients. however, lmr may not be a reliable independent marker due to conflicting or non-significant results. we anticipate that further high-quality prospective studies will validate our findings in the future.

39871958,neutrophils: from inflammatory bowel disease to colitis-associated colorectal cancer.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a non-specific inflammatory disease of digestive tract, primarily manifesting as ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). the precise etiology of ibd remains elusive. the interplay of genetic factors, environmental influences, and intestinal microbiota contributes to the establishment of an uncontrolled immune environment within the intestine, which can progressively lead to atypical hyperplasia and ultimately to malignancy over a long period. this colorectal malignant tumor that arises from chronic ibd is referred to as colitis-associated colorectal cancer (cac). dysregulation in the quantity and functionality of neutrophils plays a significant role in the onset, progression, and recurrence of ibd, as well as in the transition from ibd to cac. neutrophils affect the pathophysiology of ibd through various mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ros), degranulation, the release of inflammatory mediators and chemokines, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). these processes can induce dna mutations, thereby facilitating the development of colon cancer. given the incomplete understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying ibd and cac, effective treatment and prevention strategies remain challenging. consequently, a comprehensive review of the functional roles of neutrophils in ibd and cac is essential for advancing our understanding of ibd pathogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.",Chen T; Liu J; Hang R; Chen Q; Wang D,2025,Journal of inflammation research,18,,925-947,10.2147/JIR.S497701,"Chen, T., Liu, J., Hang, R., Chen, Q., & Wang, D.

areas covered: multidisciplinary management is critical in surgical patients to improve long-term outcomes. endoscopy plays a crucial role, both before and after surgery, in planning therapeutic strategies and stratifying risk of recurrence. aim of this review is to provide a deeper insight into the central role of endoscopy in the postoperative management of ibd patients, focusing on recent research advances, future challenges and unresolved questions.
expert opinion: both uc and cd surgical patients need endoscopy to define the correct therapeutic choice, predict subsequent disease course and adopt the correct surveillance strategy. in the next future, newer endoscopic techniques could be systematically applied in ibd patients after surgery, to assess early postoperative inflammation, response to treatment, or, regarding uc, to provide enhanced pouch surveillance, allowing for early detection of inflammation and dysplasia.",Vespa E; Furfaro F; Allocca M; Fiorino G; Correale C; Gilardi D; Argollo M; Zilli A; Zacharopoulou E; Loy L; Danese S,2020,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,14,9,829-841,10.1080/17474124.2020.1807325,"Vespa, E., Furfaro, F., Allocca, M., Fiorino, G., Correale, C., Gilardi, D., Argollo, M., Zilli, A., Zacharopoulou, E., Loy, L., & Danese, S.

40713669,role of adiponectin and its receptors adipor1/2 in inflammatory bowel disease.,"intake of nutrients and water from diet to maintain life, a typical physiological function of gut, is highly dependent on the extensive immune network, whose imbalance is easy to induce inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc). clinical strategies to completely cure ibd are poor, so it is urgent to develop novel drugs or targets. adiponectin (apn), an adipokine from adipocytes, regulates energy metabolism and immune response. high levels apn are inversely associated with cd severity uc colonic fibrosis. however, the mechanism by which apn interferes with ibd remains unclear. this review aims to analyze correlation and molecular mechanism between apn and ibd. apn and adipor2 proteins are highly expressed in colon which is a primary organ of ibd, and the target intersection of apn and ibd is huge. apn may interfere with lipid metabolism in ibd individuals through adipor1/2, but regulates neural and peripheral immune by adipor1 but not adipor2 and mediates nutritional and energy homeostasis through adipor2 rather than adipor1. besides, apn mediates crp and il-6 through adipor1/2, ampk and tnf-α through adipor1 and pi3k-akt, ppara and pparg through adipor2 to affect ibd progression, which depends on direct interaction between appl1 and adipor1/2. unexpectedly, ampk and tnf-α may also interact directly with adipor1. apn regulates cd through adipor1/2-metabolism process and uc through adipor1-inflammation axis or adipor2-fibrosis process. apn analogues or adiporon which is a dual agonist of adipor1/2 potentially reduces colonic fibrosis in uc and fistulae in cd, promotes mucosal healing, repairs intestinal microbiota homeostasis and increases autophagy to alleviate ibd symptoms by weakening tnf-α, il-6, nlrp3, tgfb1 activities and aggrandizing p-akt, ppara, pparg, ins, irs1/2, igf-1, timp1, nod2, sirt1 levels.",Zhu Q; Jia X; Li S; Feng J,2025,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,23,1,356,10.1186/s12964-025-02359-w,"Zhu, Q., Jia, X., Li, S., & Feng, J.

methods: here we conducted a narrative review focusing on the evidence regarding the role of med in ibd prevention and management.
results: epidemiological studies suggest inverse association of med with cd development. furthermore, adherence to med has been associated with clinical improvement in active cd and maintenance of lower levels of inflammatory markers in uc, along with improved quality of life and lower mortality rates in ibd patients. mechanistically, med promotes a diverse and beneficial gut microbiota, possesses anti-inflammatory properties through polyphenols and dietary fats, and may modulate oxidative stress. in clinical practice, med may be adapted to diverse disease phenotypes and cultural preferences, and is a sustainable, easy to maintain dietary approach.

33634430,increased risk of infections with anti-tnf agents in patients with crohn's disease after elective surgery: meta-analysis.,"background: postoperative complication rates in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) receiving preoperative biologics have been analyzed without considering the surgical context. emergency surgery may be associated with an increased risk of infectious complications, compared to elective operations.
aims: to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the relationship between preoperative biologic therapy and postoperative outcomes in crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), focusing on elective surgery.
methods: electronic databases were searched up to february 12, 2020, for studies of patients with ibd undergoing elective abdominal surgery receiving biologic therapy within 3 months before surgery compared to no therapy, or another biologic therapy. certainty of evidence was evaluated using grade. the primary outcomes were the rate of infections and total complications within 30 days. pooled odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated.
results: thirty-three studies were included. preoperative treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) therapy in patients with cd undergoing elective surgery was associated with increased odds of infection (or 2.05; 95% ci 1.40-3.01), but not total complications (or 1.03; 95% ci 0.71-1.51). in elective surgery for uc, preoperative anti-tnf therapy was not associated with infectious (or 1.03; 95% ci 0.34-3.07) or total complications (or 0.67; 95% ci 0.29-1.58). limited data indicate that emergency surgery did not significantly affect the rate of complications.
conclusions: anti-tnf therapy prior to elective surgery may increase the odds of postoperative infection in cd, although the certainty of evidence is very low. more evidence is needed, particularly for newer biologics.",Hanzel J; Almradi A; Istl AC; Yang ML; Fleshner KA; Parker CE; Guizzetti L; Ma C; Singh S; Jairath V,2022,Digestive diseases and sciences,67,2,646-660,10.1007/s10620-021-06895-6,"Hanzel, J., Almradi, A., Istl, A.

design: systematic review and meta-analysis.
method: we searched pubmed (medline), web of science, and scopus up until september 8, 2024. to evaluate heterogeneity among the studies, we used the chi-square test and the i2 statistic. an i2 value exceeding 50% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity. we calculated estimates of odds ratios (or), relative risks (rr), and hazard ratios (hr), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (ci). the analysis was performed using a random-effects model. we established a significance level of less than 0.05 using stata software, version 17.
results: we included a total of 17 studies in our analysis. overall, patients with ibd showed a higher risk of developing pc, with an or = 1.69 (95% ci: 1.48-1.93). specifically, patients with crohn's disease (cd) had an or of 1.25 (95% ci: 1.10-1.41), while those with ulcerative colitis (uc) had an or = 1.27 (95% ci: 1.10-1.45). furthermore, patients with ibd accompanied by primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) displayed a significantly higher risk, with an or = 3.12 (95% ci: 1.67-5.85). additionally, there was no evidence of publication bias across all subgroups. although there was no publication bias, we conducted a trim-and-fill analysis to investigate the small study effect. this analysis revealed that the results were influenced by omitted studies and that the pooled effects would be diluted if the omitted studies were included in the meta-analysis.
conclusion: cd and uc are associated with an increased risk of pc, with no significant difference in risk levels between the two conditions. however, having iibd along with psc increases the risk of pc threefold.",Salehi AM; Chegini SB; Danaei S; Hasanzarrini M; Shahbazi F,2025,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,56,1,147,10.1007/s12029-025-01266-0,"Salehi, A.

40217934,the role of histology alongside clinical and endoscopic evaluation in the management of ibd-a narrative review.,"inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), are chronic inflammatory conditions requiring continuous monitoring. today, endoscopy is the gold standard for assessing disease activity, with histological evaluation providing additional insights. studies suggest that persistent histological inflammation, despite endoscopic remission, may be associated with a higher risk of relapse in uc, suggesting its role in treatment decisions. in cd, histological assessment is limited by its patchy nature, transmural inflammation and lack of validated scoring systems. few retrospective studies with conflicting results have examined the prognostic value of histological remission in cd, and its role in predicting long-term outcomes remains unclear. this narrative review aims to summarize and discuss the available evidence regarding the additional value of histological assessment in ibd management. in uc, the ongoing verdict study is expected to provide evidence on the impact of incorporating histological remission as a treatment target compared to a strategy based on clinical and endoscopic activity. recently published interim results indicate that targeting histological remission does not lead to better clinical/biochemical disease activity. thus, while patients achieving histological healing are associated with better outcomes, the question arises whether achieving histological remission is an intrinsic (biological) characteristic of the patient and indicator of an easier to treat patient group or a result of more effective therapy.",Angyal D; Balogh F; Bessissow T; Wetwittayakhlang P; Ilias A; Gonczi L; Lakatos PL,2025,Journal of clinical medicine,14,7,,10.3390/jcm14072485,"Angyal, D., Balogh, F., Bessissow, T., Wetwittayakhlang, P., Ilias, A., Gonczi, L., & Lakatos, P.

areas covered: the aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on ct-p13 use in ibd, with particular interest in the phase ii trials of a subcutaneous version of ct-p13.
expert opinion: biosimilars, such as ct-p13, are an important resource for health-care systems. although ct-p13 approval in ibd was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. a new subcutaneous formulation of ct-p13 showed promising results in phase i and ii trials in both cd and uc. clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous ct-p13. if these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for ibd.",Parigi TL; D'Amico F; Peyrin-Biroulet L; Danese S,2021,Expert opinion on biological therapy,21,1,37-46,10.1080/14712598.2020.1811849,"Parigi, T.

methods: a comprehensive search of pubmed, embase and cochrane library was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (rcts) comparing upadacitinib with placebo in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the primary outcome was the incidence of saes, while secondary outcomes included specific adverse events. risk ratios (rr) with 95% confidence intervals (ci) were calculated.
results: six rcts, including 2611 patients, were analyzed. the incidence of saes did not significantly differ between upadacitinib (6.1%) and placebo (7%) (rr = 0.77; 95% ci: 0.50-1.20; p = 0.25). secondary outcomes showed no significant differences in serious infections, hepatic disorders, nasopharyngitis or herpes zoster. however, neutropenia (rr = 5.63; 95% ci: 1.90-16.65; p = 0.0002) and creatine kinase elevation (rr = 2.34; 95% ci: 1.22-4.47; p = 0.01) were higher with upadacitinib, while anemia (rr = 0.36; 95% ci: 0.27-0.48; p < 0.00001) and arthralgia (rr = 0.47; 95% ci: 0.30-0.75; p = 0.001) were reduced.
conclusion: upadacitinib did not increase the overall risk of saes in ibd patients, with a notable reduction in anemia and arthralgia. however, the higher risks of neutropenia and ck elevation underscore the importance of monitoring. further research is necessary to assess long-term safety, particularly regarding rare but serious events such as thromboembolism.",Falcon BTQ; de Mello Guimaraes T; Halpern GA; Gomes C; de Mello Guimaraes T,2025,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,44,2,154-162,10.1007/s12664-024-01720-0,"Falcon, B.

methods: exposure summary data were obtained from genome-wide association studies (gwas) with cohorts of ibd (12,882 cases and 21,770 controls), uc (6968 cases and 20,464 controls), and cd (5956 cases and 14,927 controls) of european descent to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) as instrumental variables. outcome summary data were obtained from a meta-analysis of 22 gwas including 22,233 cases and 64,762 controls of european descent. to estimate mr, four methods were used, including inverse variance-weighted (ivw), mr-egger, simple mode, and weighted median methods. sensitivity analysis was also performed. the bonferroni method was used to correct the bias of multiple testing.
results: three sets of snps (69 snps of ibd, 40 snps of uc, and 58 snps of cd) were used to estimate the causal effect between genetically predicted ibd and chd. using the ivw method, we found that no causal relationship between genetically predicted ibd and chd after bonferroni correction, and there was no causal relationship between uc/cd and the development of chd. no evidence of significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy was found.

38073917,the role of serological markers in the prediction of disease course and response to therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a common gastrointestinal tract disease and can be divided into two major groups: ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd). these two entities can be diagnosed from a combination of invasive and non-invasive tests as well as a thorough history and physical examination. however, invasive tests are preferred for a definitive diagnosis since the two entities have characteristic features of colonoscopy and biopsy. in this review, the following will be discussed: how non-invasive tests could help detect the presence of ibd, how markers help monitor disease progression, and how the disease responds to treatment. some of the common markers that are discussed in detail include perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (p-anca), anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (asca), c-reactive protein (crp), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), calprotectin, lactoferrin, lipocalin-2 (lcn2), and several other novel markers that are based on bacterial antigens. the best non-invasive tests available for detecting the presence of ibd are serological and fecal markers. detecting these markers has helped doctors significantly by bringing to their attention the possibility of the presence of ibd. the serological testing can also help distinguish the two forms of ibd since a different combination of markers is elevated in uc and cd. in addition, the symptoms of ibd are non-specific and usually overlap with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, so by finding these serological markers, doctors can proceed with further invasive testing that would give them a definitive diagnosis. that way, invasive testing, such as colonoscopy with biopsy, can be avoided in patients with no suspicion of ibd. the common markers used in the clinical setting to point out the presence of ibd are discussed in detail in this review. recently, more specific markers derived from bacterial antigens are also used, and their role is discussed, too.",Reghefaoui M; Peresuodei TS; Saavedra Palacios MS; Gill A; Orji C; Reghefaoui T; Mostafa J,2023,Cureus,15,11,e48442,10.7759/cureus.48442,"Reghefaoui, M., Peresuodei, T.

36219564,most placebo-controlled trials in inflammatory bowel disease were underpowered because of overestimated drug efficacy rates: results from a systematic review of induction studies.,"background and aims: most pharmaceutical clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease [ibd] are placebo-controlled and require effect size estimation for a drug relative to placebo. we compared expected effect sizes in sample size calculations [sscs] to actual effect sizes in ibd clinical trials.
methods: medline, embase, central and the cochrane library were searched from inception to march 26, 2021, to identify placebo-controlled induction studies for luminal crohn's disease [cd] and ulcerative colitis [uc] that reported an ssc and a primary endpoint of clinical remission/response. expected effects were subtracted from actual effects, and interquartile ranges [iqrs] for each corresponding median difference were calculated. linear regression was used to assess whether placebo or drug event rate misspecifications were responsible for these differences.
results: of eligible studies, 36.9% [55/149] were excluded because of incomplete ssc reporting, yielding 94 studies [46 cd, 48 uc]. treatment effects were overestimated in cd for remission (-12.6% [iqr: -16.3 to -1.6%]), in uc for remission (-10.2% [iqr: -16.5 to -5.6%]) and in cd for response (-15.3% [iqr: -27.1 to -5.8%]). differences observed were due to overestimated drug event rates, whereas expected and actual placebo event rates were similar. a meta-regression demonstrated associations between overestimated treatment effect sizes and several trial characteristics: isolated ileal disease, longer cd duration, extensive colitis [uc], single-centre, phase 2 and no endoscopic endpoint component [uc].
conclusion: overestimation of ibd therapy efficacy rates resulted in smaller-than-expected treatment effects. these results should be used to inform sscs and trial design for ibd drug development.",Bahnam P; Hanzel J; Ma C; Zou L; Narula N; Singh S; Kahan B; Jairath V,2023,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,17,3,404-417,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac150,"Bahnam, P., Hanzel, J., Ma, C., Zou, L., Narula, N., Singh, S., Kahan, B., & Jairath, V.

35677820,the impact of intestinal ultrasound on the management of inflammatory bowel disease: from established facts toward new horizons.,"intestinal ultrasound (ius) plays a crucial role as a non-invasive and accurate tool to diagnose and assess inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the rationale for using ius in crohn's disease (cd), a transmural disease, is widely acknowledged. while the use of ius in ulcerative colitis (uc), a mucosal disease, is often underestimated, but, recently, it is increasingly expanding. in the context of a treat-to-target approach, the role of ius is shifting toward a monitoring tool for predicting response to therapy. hence, adjusting therapeutic strategies based on ius response could reduce the burden related to endoscopy and speed the decision process with the ultimate goal to alter the natural course of ibd. assessment of bowel wall thickness (bwt) is the most reliable ius measure. however, the development of validated and reproducible sonographic scores to measure disease activity and the identification of parameters of therapeutic response remain relevant issues to implement the daily adoption of ius in clinical practice. accordingly, this review focuses on the current literature investigating the impact of ius on cd with emphasis on the concept of transmural healing (th) and the main related advantages. we further explore new insights on the role of ius in uc and its clinical implications.",Nardone OM; Calabrese G; Testa A; Caiazzo A; Fierro G; Rispo A; Castiglione F,2022,Frontiers in medicine,9,,898092,10.3389/fmed.2022.898092,"Nardone, O.

33233007,increased risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes in inflammatory bowel disease.,"background: previous studies showed inconsistent results regarding associations between inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and risk of ischemic heart disease (ihd) and diabetes. the present study aimed to make a meta-analysis to assess the risk of ihd and diabetes in ibd.
methods: we searched for articles published before february 2020 in the databases as follows: pubmed, web of science, medline, embase, and google scholar. we computed odds ratio (or) or relative risk (rr) and 95 % confidence intervals (ci) regarding the association between ibd and risk of ihd or diabetes by using stata 13.0 software.
results: the present meta-analysis showed that ibd was associated with higher risk of ihd (or/rr = 1.26, 95 % ci 1.20 to 1.32, i2 = 88.3 %, p < 0.0001). additionally, both ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd) were associated with higher risk of ihd (uc: or/rr = 1.19, 95 % ci 1.13 to 1.26, i2 = 65.6 %, p = 0.001; cd: or/rr = 1.33, 95 % ci 1.17 to 1.51, i2 = 89.5 %, p < 0.0001). the study showed that ibd was associated with elevated risk of diabetes (or/rr = 1.26, 95 % ci 1.03 to 1.53, i2 = 92.1 %, i2 = 92.1 %, p < 0.0001). additionally, both uc and cd were associated with higher risk of diabetes (uc: or/rr = 1.33, 95 % ci 1.03 to 1.71, i2 = 93.8 %, p < 0.0001; cd: or/rr = 1.39, 95 % ci 1.10 to 1.76, i2 = 76.7 %, p = 0.002).

32649238,case-only analysis of gene-gene interactions in inflammatory bowel disease.,"background: gene-gene interactions (g × g) potentially play a role in the etiology of complex human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and may partially explain their 'missing heritability'.
methods: using the largest genotype dataset available for ibd (16,636 crohn's disease (cd) and 12,888 ulcerative colitis (uc) cases) we analyzed g × g with the powerful case-only (co) design. we studied 169 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) for cd (156 for uc), previously shown to be associated with the respective diseases. to ensure the validity of the co design, we confined our analysis to pairs of unlinked snps. we used principal component analysis at the center level to adjust for possible causes of genotypic association other than g × g, such as population stratification and genotyping batch effects. results from center-wise logistic regression analyses were combined by a random effects meta-analysis.
results: a number of nominally significant (p < .05) g × g interactions were observed, but none of these withstood the bonferroni multiple testing correction. however, one snp pair, comprising rs26528 in the il27 gene and rs9297145 in the kpna7 gene region was characterized by an interaction odds ratio of 1.18 (95% ci: 1.10-1.27) for cd and a p-value of 7.75 × 10-6. owing to the concurrent role of the il27 and kpna7 genes in nf-κb signaling, a master regulator of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes in ibd, the observed interaction also has biological plausibility.

34964870,causal association between atopic dermatitis and inflammatory bowel disease: a 2-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization study.,"background: observational studies postulated an association between atopic dermatitis (ad) and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal.
methods: to determine whether ad is causally related to ibd and vice versa, a 2-sample mendelian randomization study was conducted. independent genetic instruments from the largest available genome-wide association study for ad (eagle eczema consortium without the 23andme study including 10,788 cases and 30,047 controls) were used to investigate the association with ibd in the uk biobank study (7045 cases, 456,327 controls) and a second european ibd sample (12,882 cases, 21,770 controls).
results: atopic dermatitis was strongly associated with higher risk of ibd as a whole (odds ratio [or], 1.107; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.035; 1.183; p = .003) in the uk biobank study. the positive association was not significant in the other ibd study (or, 1.114; 95% ci, 0.956; 1.298), but in meta-analyses of results from the 2 studies, the strong association could be confirmed (or, 1.11; 95% ci, 1.04; 1.18). when evaluating the causal relationship in the other direction, ibd as a whole did not show an association with ad. subtype analyses revealed that ad was suggestively associated with ulcerative colitis (uc; or, 1.149; 95% ci, 1.018; 1.297) but not crohn's disease (cd). however, there was a suggestive association between cd and ad (or, 1.034; 95% ci, 1.004; 1.064) but not uc and ad.

32378002,combination of biological agents in moderate to severe pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a case series and review of the literature.,"background: treatment with biological agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factors (tnfs) has become standard of care in moderate to severe pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, a significant proportion of patients experience loss of response to anti-tnfs, need treatment escalation, or develop side effects. there is no data in the literature regarding combination of biological agents in pediatric ibd.
methods: at our hospital, which is a tertiary referral center, we have combined the anti-tnf infliximab with either vedolizumab or ustekinumab in patients with severe pediatric ibd. the indications for dual biological therapy were insufficient efficacy of infliximab or vedolizumab monotherapy, or side effects such as psoriasis due to anti-tnfs.
results: eight patients (four boys) aged 14-17.5 years received a combination of infliximab and vedolizumab due to only a partial response to infliximab, four with crohn's disease (cd) and four with ulcerative colitis (uc). clinical remission was achieved in four patients (3 uc) and four had a colectomy (3 cd, 1 uc). five cd patients (3 girls) aged 11-17 years, on maintenance therapy with infliximab, developed psoriasis resistant to topical treatment. a combination of infliximab and ustekinumab resulted in clinical remission of cd without skin symptoms. no serious adverse events occurred in any of the patients on combination therapy. thirteen publications report on combining biologicals, all in adult ibd.

32560118,oral manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease and the role of non-invasive surrogate markers of disease activity.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which includes crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), can be associated with several extra-intestinal manifestations requiring a multidisciplinary management both in terms of work-up and therapy. oral lesions are common in patients with ibd, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 50%. these can represent an oral location of ibd as well as a side-effect of drugs used to treat the intestinal disease. oral manifestations, occurring in patients with ibd, can be divided in nonmalignant, specific, and non-specific ones, and malignant lesions. while there is undoubtedly a need to search for an ibd in patients with oral lesions associated with intestinal symptoms, the work-up of those with an exclusive oral lesion should be personalized. fecal calprotectin is a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation and may be used to select which patients need to undergo endoscopic examination, thereby avoiding unnecessary investigations. the pharmacological armamentarium to treat oral lesions associated with ibd includes topical or systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic drugs.",Ribaldone DG; Brigo S; Mangia M; Saracco GM; Astegiano M; Pellicano R,2020,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",7,6,,10.3390/medicines7060033,"Ribaldone, D.

40904825,review study of alteration functional activities and networks in ulcerative colitis using resting-state fmri.,"background: ulcerative colitis (uc), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), is linked to neuropsychiatric comorbidities and changes in brain connectivity through the brain-gut axis. resting-state functional mri (rs-fmri) offers a non-invasive approach to examining these neural alterations; however, no comprehensive review has compiled findings specific to uc.
objective: this review summarizes rs-fmri studies to characterize functional connectivity (fc) alterations and methodological approaches in uc patients compared to healthy controls (hcs) and other inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) subtypes.
methods: literature searches were performed in ovid, pubmed, google scholar, and embase (up to july 2025) using keywords: resting-state fmri, rs-fmri, ulcerative colitis, and uc. few studies meeting the inclusion criteria (human participants, uc diagnosis, rs-fmri analysis) were reviewed.
key findings: seven studies were included in this review. uc patients show disrupted fc in the salience, cerebellar, visual, default mode, and dorsal attention networks. reduced hippocampal activity is linked to working memory deficits, while increased fc in corticolimbic areas (e.g., caudate anterior, cingulate) correlates with active inflammation. grey matter volume decreases in cerebellar regions and increases in parahippocampal regions. sex-specific differences in fc are observed, especially in the visual and attention networks. altered fc patterns are associated with the severity of anxiety, depression, and stress. uc exhibits distinct neural signatures compared to cd.
implications: rs-fmri uncovers uc-specific neural phenotypes, advancing the mechanistic understanding of brain-gut interactions. these findings highlight potential biomarkers for neuropsychiatric comorbidities and support the use of integrated fmri in clinical assessments. future research should focus on longitudinal studies, larger cohorts, and ai-enhanced analytics to clarify causality and identify therapeutic targets.",Alyami AS,2025,Frontiers in neurology,16,,1608371,10.3389/fneur.2025.1608371,"Alyami, A.

39799299,inflammatory bowel disease increases the risk of pancreatitis: a two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis.,"background: previous studies have suggested an association between inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and pancreatitis, including acute pancreatitis (ap) and chronic pancreatitis (cp). we aimed to examine the potential causal relationship between ibd and pancreatitis using the mendelian randomization (mr) method.
methods: we obtained data from genome-wide association studies (gwass) in european individuals for ibd and its main subtypes, crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc) (31,665 ibd cases, 13,768 uc cases, 17,897 cd cases and 33,977 controls). four independent summary statistics of pancreatitis from the the european bioinformatics institute (embl-ebi, 10,630 ap cases and 844,679 controls, 1,424 cp cases and 476,104 controls) and finngen consortium (8,446 ap cases, 4,820 cp cases and 437,418 controls) were used for bidirectional mr analyses and sensitivity analysis. finally, further meta-analysis was conducted on the mr results.
results: generally, ibd is associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis (ibd-ap, or = 1.050, 95% ci 1.020-1.080, p = 7.20 × 10-5; ibd-cp, or = 1.050, 95% ci 1.010-1.090, p = 0.019). in addition, uc increased the risk of pancreatitis (uc-ap, or = 1.050, 95% ci 1.020-1.070, p = 9.10 × 10-5; uc-cp, or = 1.090, 95% ci 1.040-1.140, p = 1.44 × 10-4) and cd increased the risk of acute pancreatitis (or = 1.040, 95% ci 1.020-1.060, p = 9.61 × 10-5). however, no causal association was found between cd and the risk of chronic pancreatitis (p > 0.05). the reverse mr results showed that ap may be associated with a reduced risk of ibd and cd (ap-ibd, or = 0.880, 95% ci 0.810-0.960, p = 0.003; ap-cd, or = 0.830, 95% ci 0.730-0.940, p = 0.003). however, there is no causal relationship between ap and the risk of uc, and there is no causal relationship between cp and the risk of ibd and its subtypes(p > 0.05).
conclusion: in conclusion, based on mr analysis and meta-analysis, our results showed a positive causal effect of ibd on pancreatitis, and subgroup analyses showed that uc and cd may promote the development of acute pancreatitis, whereas uc may promote the development of chronic pancreatitis. reverse mr analysis suggests that ap may have a potential protective effect on ibd and cd.",Fang LH; Zhang JQ; Huang JK; Tang XD,2025,BMC gastroenterology,25,1,13,10.1186/s12876-024-03571-7,"Fang, L.

36159838,are neurodegenerative diseases associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease? a two-sample mendelian randomization study.,"background: several studies have shown that neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., parkinson's disease [pd] and alzheimer's disease [ad]) are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), but the causality and direction of their associations remain unclear. mendelian randomization (mr) studies have explored the causal effects of ibd on pd and ad. however, only a few studies examined this reverse association. thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted pd and ad with ibd, using a two-sample mr study.
methods: summary statistics for ibd, ulcerative colitis (uc), and crohn's disease (cd) were derived from a genome-wide association study (gwas) meta-analysis, which included the international ibd genetics consortium and the uk ibd genetics consortium (n=59,957). genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of gwas of pd (n=1,474,097) and ad (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. we used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (ivw), weighted median (wm), mr-egger regression, weighted mode, and robust adjusted profile score (raps) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted pd and ad on ibd. to confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations.
results: the results of the ivw method, wm, and raps showed that genetically predicted pd was significantly associated with an increased risk of uc (odds ratio [or]ivw=1.068, or wm=1.107, or raps=1.069, all p<0.05). additionally, we found that there were significant associations of genetically predicted pd with cd (or ivw=1.064, or raps=1.065, all p<0.05) and ibd (or ivw=1.062, or raps=1.063, all p<0.05) using the ivw method and raps. however, there was no significant causal evidence of genetically predicted ad in ibd, uc, or cd among all mr methods. in all mr analyses, there were no horizontal pleiotropy (all p>0.05), or statistical heterogeneity. the sensitivity analysis results of the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the causal effect estimations of genetically predicted pd and ad on ibd were robust.
conclusions: our mr study corroborated a causal association between genetically predicted pd and ibd but did not support a causal effect of genetically predicted ad on ibd. more animal experiments or population-based observational studies are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms of pd and ibd.",Cui G; Li S; Ye H; Yang Y; Huang Q; Chu Y; Shi Z; Zhang X,2022,Frontiers in immunology,13,,956005,10.3389/fimmu.2022.956005,"Cui, G., Li, S., Ye, H., Yang, Y., Huang, Q., Chu, Y., Shi, Z., & Zhang, X.

methods: mr analyses were performed using summary data of a genome-wide association study (gwas) on individuals of european ancestry. independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms correlated with eoe (from a gwas meta-analysis containing 1,930 cases and 13,634 controls) and ibd (from finngen gwass containing 9,083 ibd, 2,033 cd, and 5,931 uc cases, and gwass of ibd genetic consortium containing 12,882 ibd, 6,968 uc, and 5,956 cd cases) were selected as instruments. we applied the inverse variance weighted (ivw) method as the primary analysis followed by several sensitivity analyses. for the forward mr study, estimates from ivw methods were subsequently meta-analyzed using a random-effect model.
results: our results suggested a causal effect of eoe on ibd [pooled odds ratio (or), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (ci), 1.02-1.13] and eoe on uc (pooled or, 1.09, 95% ci, 1.04-1.14). no causal link between eoe and cd was observed (pooled or, 1.05; 95% ci, 0.96-1.16). the reverse mr analyses revealed no causal effect of ibd (and its subtypes) on eoe. sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of primary results.
conclusions: our findings provided evidence of a suggestive causal effect of eoe on ibd (specifically on uc) in the european population. increased awareness of concurrent or subsequent ibd in patients with eoe is called for. still, the present evidence is not adequate enough and ought to be validated by further investigations.",Ji R; Zhi Y,2024,Frontiers in immunology,15,,1374107,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1374107,"Ji, R., & Zhi, Y.

38665135,c-reactive protein: an inflammatory biomarker and a predictor of neurodegenerative disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease?,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) refers to two chronic conditions of the digestive tract: ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd), representing a progressive inflammatory process that mainly occurs in the gut, with frequent extra-intestinal manifestations. even if remission is periodically obtained for some patients, the histological activity and digestive symptoms may continue, maintaining a persistent systemic inflammation that could induce further extra-intestinal complications and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disease. c-reactive protein (crp) is an acute-phase reactant that is widely accepted as a dominant serum biomarker in ibd. crp consequently activates the complement cascade, supports the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the clearance of microbial pathogens. all these processes facilitate further processes, including atherosclerosis and hypercoagulability, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and the increased permeability of the intestinal barrier for neurotoxic substances produced by gut microorganisms, due to the presence of a high level of lipopolysaccharides. for ibd, the connection between intestinal inflammation and central nervous system inflammation could be explained through the activity of the vagus nerve, a carrier of cytokines, crp, and toxic materials to the brain, potentially inducing vascular lesions and damage of the glial vascular unit, with further risk for degeneration within the central nervous system. crp is a key marker for ibd pathogenesis and is able to dissociate into its monomeric form, mcrp, on contact with activated cell and tissue components via the systemic circulation. we hypothesize that the chronic inflammatory process within ibd could initiate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and therefore, further investigation of the significance of chronically raised plasma of crp and mcrp in patients with ibd is warranted, as it may represent a critical predictive factor associated with a later neurodegenerative risk. any future initiative aimed at pharmacologic modulation of crp (e.g., blocking crp-mcrp dissociation), could represent a new therapeutic approach protecting against intestinal inflammation and concomitantly reducing the risk of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline.",Muresan S; Slevin M,2024,Cureus,16,4,e59009,10.7759/cureus.59009,"Muresan, S., & Slevin, M.

40187540,small molecule drug absorption in inflammatory bowel disease and current implementation in physiologically- based pharmacokinetic models.,"inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, with predominant localization in the colon in ulcerative colitis (uc) or affecting the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract in crohn's disease (cd). recent advances in the drug development space have been marked by a return to orally administered small molecules with novel mechanisms of action such as janus kinase inhibitors. additionally, the prevalence of certain chronic conditions is higher in ibd patients, many of which are treated with orally administered drugs. given the pathophysiology and localization of ibd, altered drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract can be expected. this review discusses several physiological differences between the small and large intestine with the potential to influence drug absorption including pathophysiology related alterations associated with ibd. the main physiological parameters which are identified include luminal fluid volume, luminal ph, transit time, bile salt concentration, microbiome, absorptive surface area, permeability and metabolizing enzymes and transporters. literature regarding these factors in ibd patients is marked with high heterogeneity in reporting of disease severity and location leading to difficulties in interpreting data across different studies. while the influence of most of these factors has been directly assessed in healthy volunteers, this is rarely the case for ibd patients. furthermore, studies which used pbpk modelling to describe the pk of an orally administered drug in an ibd population and were able to verify their findings using clinical data are critically examined. these models were able to incorporate the pathophysiological changes associated with ibd and partly succeeded in adequately predicting drug absorption in this population. given the limited amount of pbpk studies performed on a limited number of drugs, the developed models are most likely not suitable to be used as a general pbpk model for the ibd population.",Langeraert J; Gasthuys E; Vermeulen A,2025,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,209,,107095,10.1016/j.ejps.2025.107095,"Langeraert, J., Gasthuys, E., & Vermeulen, A.

40806882,intestinal microbiota and fecal transplantation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and clostridioides difficile: an updated literature review.,"background/objectives: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is characterized by chronic relapsing and remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) has emerged as an fda-approved treatment for recurrent clostridioides difficile infections (cdis), with promising potential in patients with ibd. this manuscript aimed to provide a comprehensive and updated review of the available literature on fecal microbiota transplantation, its clinical use in ibd in general, as well as in patients with ibd and cdi. methods: an extensive literature search was performed from october 2024 to march 2025. all publications available within pubmed, medline, embase, google scholar, and cochrane databases were reviewed. all original articles, case reports, review articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included. qualitative and quantitative data were both extracted. discussion: intestinal microbiota is an integral part of the human body, and dysbiosis (an imbalance in the gut's microbial community) has been linked with several pathologies. dysbiosis in ibd is marked by reduced beneficial bacteria and increased pro-inflammatory pathogens, contributing to mucosal damage and immune dysregulation. fmt has emerged as a solution to dysbiosis, with the first case recorded in 1917. fmt has been successful in treating patients with cdi. the diagnostic value of the gut microbiome is currently being explored as a possible therapeutic approach to ibd. several studies have assessed fmt in patients with ibd and cdi with promising results in both ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn's disease (cd) but varying efficacy based on administration routes, donor selection, and processing methods. in the context of recurrent cdi in patients with ibd, fmt demonstrates a high cure rate and potential benefit in concurrently improving ibd activity. however, risks such as ibd flare-ups post-fmt remain a concern. conclusions: fmt holds promising potential in the management of cdi in patients with ibd. by restoring microbial diversity and correcting dysbiosis, fmt offers a novel, microbiota-targeted alternative to conventional therapies. while data support its efficacy in improving disease remission, variability in outcomes underscores the need for standardized protocols and additional large-scale, controlled studies. continued research efforts into donor selection, treatment regimens, and long-term safety will be critical to optimizing fmt's role in ibd and cdi care as well as improving patient outcomes.",Lahoud C; Habib T; Kalta D; Dimachkie R; El Sayegh S; Deeb L,2025,Journal of clinical medicine,14,15,,10.3390/jcm14155260,"Lahoud, C., Habib, T., Kalta, D., Dimachkie, R., El Sayegh, S., & Deeb, L.

methods: literature search was conducted through pubmed, cnki, and web of science databases. pooled or and 95% ci was used to assess the association between the allelic, dominant and recessive models of il23r rs11209026 and rs10889677 polymorphisms and uc and cd risk.
results: 41 publications with 13,803 patients with cd and 17,446 controls, as well as 5876 patients with uc and 10,053 controls were included in the present study. all the genetic models of rs11209026 polymorphism significantly decrease cd and uc risk (except for the recessive model in uc) (p < 0.05). a subgroup analysis based on ethnicity showed that the allelic (p < 0.00001, or = 0.65) and dominant models (p < 0.00001, or = 0.61) of rs11209026 polymorphism were significantly associated with uc risk in caucasians, but not in asians (p > 0.05). in addition, the allelic (cd: p < 0.00001, or = 1.34; uc: p < 0.00001, or = 1.22) and dominant models (cd: p = 0.002, or = 1.39; uc: p = 0.01, or = 1.29), but not the recessive model of rs10889677 polymorphism significantly increase the risk of cd and uc (p > 0.05). a subgroup analysis showed that the genetic models of rs10889677 polymorphism were associated with cd risk in caucasians (p < 0.05), but not in asians (p > 0.05). the dominant model of rs10889677 polymorphism was associated with uc risk in asians (p = 0.04, or = 1.54), but not in caucasians (p > 0.05).

40841786,main genetic factors associated with inflammatory bowel diseases and their consequences on intestinal permeability: involvement in gut inflammation.,"crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), the two main subtypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. ibd are multifactorial diseases with a complex etiology, involving an intricate interaction between environmental and genetic factors. since the discovery of nod2 gene in 2001, genome-wide association studies have reported more than 200 ibd susceptibility loci. the strongest associations highlighted five main pathways as altered in ibd: bacterial sensing (nod2), autophagy (atg16l1, irgm...), endoplasmic reticulum stress (xbp1, arg2...), th-17 immune pathway (il23-receptor), and the vitamin d receptors (vdr). the pathophysiology of ibd results from an abnormal immune response toward an altered gut microbiota. although the primum movens remains unknown, an increased intestinal permeability is clearly involved in the genesis of this abnormal crosstalk, leading to whole tissue inflammation. thus, an excessive intestinal permeability, or ""leaky gut"", has been described to precede the development of cd. moreover, in ibd, intestinal permeability is described to be a sensitive prognostic indicator of relapse in patients with quiescent ibd. thus, the aim of this review is to highlight the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the main pathways associated with ibd could contribute to alter the intestinal permeability to favour and/or exacerbate chronic inflammation, leading to debilitating diseases.",Mauduit A; Mas E; Solà-Tapias N; Ménard S; Barreau F,2025,Journal of gastroenterology,,,,10.1007/s00535-025-02289-x,"Mauduit, A., Mas, E., Solà-Tapias, N., Ménard, S., & Barreau, F.

patient concerns: a 43-year-old male presented with recurrent episodes of mucus and bloody stools persisting for more than a month without any identifiable triggering factors. initially, the stool consistency was normal, but it progressively shifted to a loose and watery texture, with up to 8 occurrences daily.
diagnoses: this case underscores the diagnosis of severe uc through colonoscopy and colonic biopsy, along with the supplementary identification of a positive result for clostridioides difficile in the fecal sample.
interventions: the patient initiated infliximab therapy alongside a full vancomycin course, demonstrating the potential effectiveness of this intervention in managing early-stage ulcerative colitis with concurrent clostridioides difficile infection.
outcomes: following the completion of a full vancomycin course, the patient initiated infliximab therapy. the patient was free from significant discomfort, exhibited no fever, and had no mucopurulent bloody stools. a follow-up blood test indicated reduced inflammatory markers compared to the preoperative period, and the stools were normal.
lessons: we illustrate the potential effectiveness of this medication by presenting an in-depth case report of a patient with early-stage uc. the report outlines the patient inclusion of infliximab to better manage uc inflammation alongside an adjunct vancomycin regimen, given the ineffectiveness of mesalazine therapy and the concurrent presence of clostridium difficile infection. this case prompts consideration of therapeutic approaches for complex uc and contributes to advancing both research and clinical practice. nonetheless, we should remain attentive to the variations and potential risks unique to each patient in order to formulate personalized treatment strategies.",Gao X; Zhou H; Hu Z; Wang Q; Chen Y; Zh F; Zhou G,2024,Medicine,103,6,e36693,10.1097/MD.0000000000036693,"Gao, X., Zhou, H., Hu, Z., Wang, Q., Chen, Y., Zh, F., & Zhou, G.

38183088,assessing causality between inflammatory bowel diseases with frailty index and sarcopenia: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study.,"background: previous studies have found that frailty and sarcopenia are commonly diagnosed in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients, indicating an association between these conditions. nonetheless, the cause‒effect connection between ibd, frailty, and sarcopenia remains unclear.
methods: we sourced the genetic variants for the exposures and outcomes from publicly accessible, extensive genome-wide association studies (gwas). specifically, we obtained ibd data from the international ibd genetics consortium, frailty index (fi) data from the united kingdom biobank and swedish twingene, and sarcopenia data from a recent gwas meta-analysis. five methods, including inverse variance weighted (ivw), simple mode, mr-egger, weighted mode, and the weighted median, were used to proceed with mr estimates. we also performed heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests.
results: our results indicated a positive causal relationship between ulcerative colitis (uc) (ivw: β = 0.014, 95% ci, 0.006 to 0.021, p = 0.001) and crohn's disease (cd) (ivw: β = 0.012; 95% ci, 0.006 to 0.018, p = 2e-04) with the fi. however, we uncovered no proof of a cause-and-effect relationship between uc (ivw: β = 0.001, 95% ci, -0.015 to 0.017, p = 0.344) or cd (ivw: β = 0.003, 95% ci, -0.009 to 0.015, p = 0.214) and sarcopenia. additionally, in the inverse order, we also discovered no cause-and-effect connection between fi or sarcopenia on uc or cd in this study.

39642943,the role of urine metabolomics in the diagnosis and management of adult and pediatric crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.,"introduction: urine metabolomics offers a non-invasive approach to diagnose and manage inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and ulcerative colitis (uc), by identifying distinct metabolic signatures.
objectives: this narrative review summarizes current findings on urinary metabolites in ibd, evaluating their roles in disease differentiation, assessment of activity, and monitoring therapeutic response.
methods: a comprehensive literature search of pubmed and medline up to october 2023 was conducted using keywords, such as 'urine metabolomics', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis', and 'urinary biomarkers'. studies were included that described alterations to metabolic pathways, including those related to the urea cycle, central energy metabolism (krebs cycle), amino acid metabolism, and neurotransmitters.
results: specific urinary metabolites differentiate ibd patients from healthy controls and between cd and uc. decreased urinary levels of hippurate, acetate, methanol, formate, and methylamine are observed in ibd, indicating altered gut microbiota. in cd patients, urea cycle alterations include reduced urinary urea and ornithine with increased arginine. changes in krebs cycle intermediates show decreased citrate and succinate in adults, but increased fumarate and isocitrate in pediatric patients, reflecting energy metabolism differences. amino acid metabolism differs by age: adults exhibit decreased urinary asparagine, lysine, and histidine, while pediatric patients show increased methionine, proline, aspartic acid, and isoleucine. elevated urinary neurotransmitters like dopamine are noted in pediatric ibd patients. urine metabolomics also can monitor treatment efficacy by distinguishing responders from non-responders to therapies and differentiating active disease from remission.

32940190,regulation of micrornas in inflammation-associated colorectal cancer: a mechanistic approach.,"the development of colorectal cancer (crc) is a multistage process. the inflammation of the colon as in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) such as ulcerative colitis (uc) or crohn's disease (cd) is often regarded as the initial trigger for the development of inflammation-associated crc. many cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) and interleukins (ils) are known to exert proinflammatory actions, and inflammation initiates or promotes tumorigenesis of various cancers, including crc, through differential regulation of micrornas (mirnas/mirs). mirnas can be oncogenic mirnas (oncomirs) or anti-oncomirs/tumor suppressor mirnas, and they play key roles during colorectal carcinogenesis. however, the functions and molecular mechanisms of regulation of mirnas involved in inflammation-associated crc are still anecdotal and largely unknown. consolidating the published results and offering perspective solutions to circumvent crc, the current review is focused on the role of mirnas and their regulation in the development of crc. we have also discussed the model systems adapted by researchers to delineate the role of mirnas in inflammation-associated crc.",Muthusami S; Ramachandran I; Krishnamoorthy S; Sambandam Y; Ramalingam S; Queimado L; Chaudhuri G; Ramachandran IK,2021,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",21,1,67-76,10.2174/1871530320666200917112802,"Muthusami, S., Ramachandran, I., Krishnamoorthy, S., Sambandam, Y., Ramalingam, S., Queimado, L., Chaudhuri, G., & Ramachandran, I.

39707170,role of micrornas in immunoregulatory functions of epithelial cells.,"epithelial cells (ecs) provide the first line of defense against microbial threats and environmental challenges. they participate in the host's immune responses via the expression and secretion of various immune-related molecules such as cytokines and chemokines, as well as interaction with immune cells. a growing body of evidence suggests that the dysregulated function of ecs can be involved in the pathophysiology of a broad range of infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), asthma, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. to maintain a substantial immunoregulatory function of ecs, precise expression of different molecules and their regulatory effects are indispensable. micrornas (mirnas, mirs) are small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression commonly at post-transcriptional level through degradation of target messenger rnas (mrnas) or suppression of protein translation. mirnas implicate as critical regulators in many cellular processes, including apoptosis, growth, differentiation, and immune response. due to the crucial roles of mirnas in such a vast range of biological processes, they have become the spotlight of biological research for more than two decades, but we are still at the beginning stages of the use of mirna-based therapies in the improvement of human health. hence, in the present paper, attempts are made to provide a comprehensive overview with regard to the roles of mirnas in the immunoregulatory functions of ecs. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which immunoregulatory properties of ecs are manifested, could aid the development of efficient strategies to prevent and treat multiple human diseases.",Jafari N; Abediankenari S,2024,BMC immunology,25,1,84,10.1186/s12865-024-00675-3,"Jafari, N., & Abediankenari, S.

methods: a comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine recent studies focusing on mirna-mediated modulation of signaling pathways related to prrs and junctional complexes. particular attention was given to the expression and regulation of key junctional complexes such as claudin, occludin, and zonula occludens, and their relationship with epithelial homeostasis.
results: emerging evidence demonstrates that mirnas modulate both inflammatory signaling and structural junctional integrity. dysregulated expression of specific mirnas is associated with impaired barrier function and increased intestinal permeability, contributing to the pathogenesis of ibd. moreover, experimental data suggest that mirna mimics and antagomirs may help restore epithelial barrier integrity and reduce inflammation.

methods: systematic review of prospective controlled trials of solid food diets for the induction or maintenance of remission in ibd. two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and assessment of certainty of evidence. meta-analyses were performed on studies with quantitative data on response, remission, and relapse.
results: there were 27 studies for meta-analysis. for induction of remission in crohn's disease (cd), low refined carbohydrate diet and symptoms-guided diet outperformed controls, but studies had serious imprecision and very low certainty of evidence. the mediterranean diet was similar to the specific carbohydrate diet (low certainty of evidence), and partial enteral nutrition (pen) was similar to exclusive enteral nutrition (very low certainty of evidence). pen reduced risk of relapse (very low certainty of evidence), whereas reduction of red meat or refined carbohydrates did not (low certainty of evidence). for ulcerative colitis, diets were similar to controls (very low and low certainty of evidence).
conclusions: among the most robust dietary trials in ibd currently available, certainty of evidence remains very low or low. nonetheless, emerging data suggest potential benefit with pen for induction and maintenance of remission in cd. reduction of red meat and refined carbohydrates might not reduce risk of cd relapse. as more dietary studies become available, the certainty of evidence could improve, thus allowing for more meaningful recommendations for patients.",Limketkai BN; Godoy-Brewer G; Parian AM; Noorian S; Krishna M; Shah ND; White J; Mullin GE,2023,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,21,10,2508-2525.e10,10.1016/j.cgh.2022.11.026,"Limketkai, B.

36669515,management of inflammatory bowel diseases in older adults.,"the burden of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) in older adults (ie, aged over 60 years old) is increasing due to a combination of an ageing population with compounding prevalence of ibd and increasing incidence of elderly-onset (ie, onset over the age of 60 years) ibd. despite the increasing prevalence of ibd, there is a paucity of evidence on which to base management of older adults with ibd, leading to substantial variability in care. this population is under-represented in clinical trials and has a high burden of chronic corticosteroid use, low uptake of steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents, and high rates of unplanned health-care use and disability. management of ibd in older adults requires carefully weighing an individual patient's risk of ibd-related complications, ibd-directed immunosuppressive therapy, and non-ibd comorbidities. a deeper understanding of biological and functional age, dynamic risk stratification strategies (including frailty-based risk assessment tools), comparative effectiveness and safety of current therapies and treatment strategies, and shared decision making to inform treatment goals and targets is needed to improve outcomes in older adults with ibd. in this review, we discuss the epidemiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and medical and surgical management of older individuals living with ibd and identify key research gaps and approaches to address them.",Singh S; Boland BS; Jess T; Moore AA,2023,The lancet.

37834360,"omics and multi-omics in ibd: no integration, no breakthroughs.","the recent advent of sophisticated technologies like sequencing and mass spectroscopy platforms combined with artificial intelligence-powered analytic tools has initiated a new era of ""big data"" research in various complex diseases of still-undetermined cause and mechanisms. the investigation of these diseases was, until recently, limited to traditional in vitro and in vivo biological experimentation, but a clear switch to in silico methodologies is now under way. this review tries to provide a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art knowledge on omes, omics and multi-omics in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the notion and importance of omes, omics and multi-omics in both health and complex diseases like ibd is introduced, followed by a discussion of the various omics believed to be relevant to ibd pathogenesis, and how multi-omics ""big data"" can generate new insights translatable into useful clinical tools in ibd such as biomarker identification, prediction of remission and relapse, response to therapy, and precision medicine. the pitfalls and limitations of current ibd multi-omics studies are critically analyzed, revealing that, regardless of the types of omes being analyzed, the majority of current reports are still based on simple associations of descriptive retrospective data from cross-sectional patient cohorts rather than more powerful longitudinally collected prospective datasets. given this limitation, some suggestions are provided on how ibd multi-omics data may be optimized for greater clinical and therapeutic benefit. the review concludes by forecasting the upcoming incorporation of multi-omics analyses in the routine management of ibd.",Fiocchi C,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,19,,10.3390/ijms241914912,"Fiocchi, C.

methods: we searched major databases from inception to june 2020 for studies estimating the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in ibd when using biologics (anti-tumor necrosis factor [tnf], anti-integrins, and anticytokines). prevalence and relative risk (rr) were pooled using a random-effects model.
results: forty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis comprising 6963 patients. biologic therapy in ibd pregnancies was associated with a pooled prevalence of 8% (95% ci, 6%-10%; i2 = 87.4%) for early pregnancy loss, 9% (95% ci, 7%-11%; i2 = 89.9%) for preterm birth, 0% (95% ci, 0%-0%; i2 = 0%) for stillbirth, 8% (95% ci, 5%-10%; i2 = 87.0%) for low birth weight, and 1% (95% ci, 1%-2%; i2 = 78.3%) for congenital malformations. these rates are comparable with those published in the general population. in subgroup analyses of a small number of studies, the prevalence of early pregnancy loss and preterm birth were higher in vedolizumab vs anti-tnf users. meta-regression did not show an association of disease activity or concomitant thiopurine on adverse outcomes. continued tnf inhibitor use during the third trimester was not associated with risk of preterm birth (rr, 1.41; 95% ci, 0.77-2.60; i2 = 0%), low birth weight (rr, 1.32; 95% ci, 0.80-2.18; i2 = 0%), or congenital malformations (rr, 1.28; 95% ci, 0.47-3.49; i2 = 0%).

methods: through a systematic search until february 28, 2022, we included 20 head-to-head studies comparing risk of serious infections with tumor necrosis factor α (tnfα) antagonists, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, filgotinib, and ozanimod in patients with ibd. we performed random-effects meta-analysis comparing different advanced therapies.
results: no significant difference was observed in the risk of serious infections between vedolizumab vs tnfα antagonists in all patients with ibd (17 cohorts: odds ratio [or], 0.84; 95% ci, 0.68-1.04), with moderate heterogeneity (i2 = 37%); on subgroup analysis, vedolizumab was associated with a lower risk of serious infections in patients with ulcerative colitis (11 cohorts: or, 0.68; 95% ci, 0.56-0.83; i2 = 0%), but not in crohn's disease (cd) (9 cohorts: or, 1.03; 95% ci, 0.78-1.35; i2 = 42%). age, sex, prior biologic exposure, and use of biologic monotherapy did not influence this association. in patients with cd, ustekinumab was associated with a lower risk of serious infections vs tnfα antagonists (3 cohorts: or, 0.49; 95% ci, 0.25-0.93; i2 = 16%) and vs vedolizumab (3 cohorts: or, 0.40; 95% ci, 0.17-0.93; i2 = 67%). few studies compared other advanced therapies.

39056556,using diet to treat inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"introduction: to review the efficacy of various dietary interventions for induction of clinical remission in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and provide healthcare providers with a practical reference for recommending suitable diets for managing patients with ibd.
methods: pubmed, medline(r), and cochrane were searched from inception up to february 17, 2023, to identify all studies reporting information on using diet to treat ibd. studies investigating the role of dietary interventions in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of active ibd for improvement or remission of ibd symptoms were rigorously considered. sample meal plans, with a list of included and excluded foods, were also generated to provide clinicians with practical tools for advising patients on dietary intake.
results: eleven included studies provided data on 10 distinct diets: autoimmune protocol diet, high-fiber diet, 4-strategies-to-sulfide-reduction diet, highly restricted diet, mcmaster elimination diet for crohn's disease, specific carbohydrate diet, mediterranean diet, crohn's disease exclusion diet, individualized elimination diet, and the food-specific igg4-guided exclusion diet. a total of 9 studies provided data on clinical remission. many of these diets share common elements, such as an initial elimination phase with subsequent reintroduction of dietary components, inclusion of whole foods, and exclusion of highly or ultraprocessed foods.
discussion: currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of specific diets to treat adult patients with mildly to moderately active ibd. larger, randomized studies with standardized methodologies and outcome measures, rigorous adherence assessment, and an emphasis on endoscopic assessment outcome measures are required to validate most diets that have been studied for ibd. the included sample diet plans and dietary recommendations may prove helpful in the interim as part of a holistic strategy to manage patients with ibd.",Gleave A; Shah A; Tahir U; Blom JJ; Dong E; Patel A; Marshall JK; Narula N,2025,The American journal of gastroenterology,120,1,83-97,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002973,"Gleave, A., Shah, A., Tahir, U., Blom, J.

36884164,cost-effectiveness analysis of tofacitinib compared with biologics in biologic-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in japan.,"objective: tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (uc). the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus current biologics, considering combinations of first-line (1l) and second-line (2l) therapies, from a japanese payer's perspective in patients with moderate-to-severe active uc following an inadequate response to conventional therapy and in those who were naïve to biologics.
methods: a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted during the time horizon specified in the markov model, which considers a patient's lifetime as 60 years and an annual discount rate of 2% on costs and effects. the model compared tofacitinib with vedolizumab, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and ustekinumab. the time of active treatment was divided into induction and maintenance phases. patients not responding to their biologic treatment after induction or during the maintenance phase were switched to a subsequent line of therapy. treatment response and remission probabilities (for induction and maintenance phases) were obtained through a systematic literature review and a network meta-analysis that employed a multinomial analysis with fixed effects. patient characteristics were sourced from the octave induction trials. mean utilities associated with uc health states and adverse events (aes) were obtained from published sources. direct medical costs related to drug acquisition, administration, surgery, patient management, and aes were derived from the jmdc database analysis, which corresponded with the medical procedure fees from 2021. the drug prices were adjusted to april 2021. further validation through all processes by clinical experts in japan was conducted to fit the costs to real-world practices. scenario and sensitivity analyses were also performed to confirm the accuracy and robustness of the base-case results.
results: in the base-case, the treatment pattern including 1l tofacitinib was more cost-effective than vedolizumab, infliximab, golimumab, and ustekinumab for 1l therapies in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (qaly) gained (based on the japanese threshold of 5,000,000 yen/qaly [38,023 united states dollars {usd}/qaly]). the base-case results demonstrated that the incremental costs would be reduced for all biologics, and decreases in incremental qalys were observed for all biologics other than adalimumab. the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) was found to be dominant for adalimumab; for the other biologics, it was found to be less costly and less efficacious. the efficiency frontier on the cost-effectiveness plane indicated that tofacitinib-infliximab and infliximab-tofacitinib were more cost-effective than the other treatment patterns. when infliximab-tofacitinib was compared with tofacitinib-infliximab, the icer was 282,609,856 yen/qaly (2,149,157 usd/qaly) and the net monetary benefit (nmb) was -12,741,342 yen (-96,894 usd) with a threshold of 5,000,000 yen (38,023 usd) in japan. therefore, infliximab-tofacitinib was not acceptable by this threshold, and tofacitinib-infliximab was the cost-effective treatment pattern.
conclusion: the current analysis suggests that the treatment pattern including 1l tofacitinib is a cost-effective alternative to the biologics for patients with moderate-to-severe uc from a japanese payer's perspective.",Kobayashi T; Hoshi M; Yuasa A; Arai S; Ikeda M; Matsuda H; Kim SW; Hibi T,2023,PharmacoEconomics,41,5,589-604,10.1007/s40273-023-01254-x,"Kobayashi, T., Hoshi, M., Yuasa, A., Arai, S., Ikeda, M., Matsuda, H., Kim, S.

methods: a search of databases and abstracts from gastroenterology conferences was performed. primary outcomes included overall and infectious postoperative complication rates as well as surgical site infections. studies that compared crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or patients with ibd-undefined with preoperative vedolizumab treatment undergoing abdominal surgery with controls with preoperative antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-tnf-α) treatment or no preoperative biologic treatment were included. a meta-analysis was completed using the mantel-haenszel and dersimonian and laird models.
results: six studies totaling 1201 patients were included; 281 patients were treated preoperatively with vedolizumab, 327 patients were treated preoperatively with anti-tnf-α agents, and 593 patients were not treated preoperatively with any biologics. there was no significant difference in overall complications (odds ratio [or] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.48-2.24, p = 0.92, i2 =77%) between the vedolizumab and no-biologic groups. there also was no significant difference in infectious complications (or 1.00, 95% ci 0.37-2.69, p = 1.00, i2 = 78%), which persisted after sensitivity analysis (or 0.71, 95% ci 0.31-1.60, p = 0.41, i2 = 46%). furthermore, there was no significant difference in overall complications (or 0.77, 95% ci 0.24-2.46, p = 0.66, i2 = 85%) and infectious complications (or 0.89, 95% ci 0.20-3.94, p = 0.87, i2 = 86%) between the vedolizumab and anti-tnf-α groups. after sensitivity analysis, differences in overall and infectious complications remained insignificant (or 0.54 and 0.50, 95% ci 0.24-1.17 and 0.22-1.15, p = 0.12 and 0.10, i2 = 39% and 18%, respectively). vedolizumab was also not associated with a significant increase in surgical site infections compared with the no-biologic (or 1.45, 95% ci 0.33-6.32, p = 0.62, i2 = 75%) and anti-tnf (or 1.30, 95% ci 0.22-7.60, p = 0.77, i2 = 81%) groups.

37543040,efficacy of psychological therapies in people with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: there is increasing evidence for an influence of the gut-brain axis on the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). psychological therapies could, therefore, have beneficial effects in individuals with ibd, but data are conflicting. we aimed to update our previous systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether the inclusion of more randomised controlled trials (rcts) showed any beneficial effects and whether these effects varied by treatment modality.
methods: in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched medline, embase, embase classic, psychinfo, and the cochrane central register of controlled trials from jan 1, 2016, to april 30, 2023, for rcts published in any language recruiting individuals aged 16 years or older with ibd that compared psychological therapy with a control intervention or treatment as usual. we pooled dichotomous data to obtain relative risks (rr) with 95% cis of inducing remission in people with active disease or of relapse in people with quiescent disease at final follow-up. we pooled continuous data to estimate standardised mean differences (smd) with 95% cis in disease activity indices, anxiety scores, depression scores, stress scores, and quality-of-life scores at completion of therapy and at final follow-up. we pooled all data using a random-effects model. trials were analysed separately according to whether they recruited people with clinically active ibd or predominantly individuals whose disease was quiescent. we conducted subgroup analyses by mode of therapy and according to whether trials recruited selected groups of people with ibd. we used the cochrane risk of bias tool to assess bias at the study level and assessed funnel plots using the egger test. we assessed heterogeneity using the i2 statistic.
findings: the updated literature search identified a total of 469 new records, 11 of which met eligibility criteria. 14 studies were included from our previous meta-analysis published in 2017. in total, 25 rcts were eligible for this meta-analysis, all of which were at high risk of bias. only four rcts recruited patients with active ibd; there were insufficient data for meta-analysis of remission, disease activity indices, depression scores, and stress scores. in patients with active ibd, psychological therapy had no benefit compared with control for anxiety scores at completion of therapy (two rcts; 79 people; smd -1·04, 95% ci -2·46 to 0·39), but did have significant benefit for quality-of-life scores at completion of therapy (four rcts; 309 people; 0·68, 0·09 to 1·26), although heterogeneity between studies was high (i2=82%). in individuals with quiescent ibd, rr of relapse of disease activity was not reduced with psychological therapy (ten rcts; 861 people; rr 0·83, 95% ci 0·62 to 1·12), with moderate heterogeneity (i2=60%), and the funnel plot suggested evidence of publication bias or other small study effects (egger test p=0·046). for people with quiescent ibd at completion of therapy, there was no difference in disease activity indices between psychological therapy and control (13 rcts; 1015 people; smd -0·01, 95% ci -0·13 to 0·12; i2=0%). anxiety scores (13 rcts; 1088 people; -0·23, -0·36 to -0·09; 18%), depression scores (15 rcts; 1189 people; -0·26, -0·38 to -0·15; 2%), and stress scores (11 rcts; 813 people; -0·22, -0·42 to -0·03; 47%) were significantly lower, and quality-of-life scores (16 rcts; 1080 people; 0·31, 0·16 to 0·46; 30%) were significantly higher, with psychological therapy versus control at treatment completion. statistically significant benefits persisted up to final follow-up for depression scores (12 rcts; 856 people; -0·16, -0·30 to -0·03; 0%). effects were strongest in rcts of third-wave therapies and in rcts that recruited people with impaired psychological health, fatigue, or reduced quality of life at baseline.
interpretation: psychological therapies have beneficial, short-term effects on anxiety, depression, stress, and quality-of-life scores, but not on disease activity. further rcts in selected groups are needed to establish the place for such therapies in ibd care.

34797516,anti-drug antibody formation against biologic agents in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and aims: immunogenicity with formation of anti-drug antibodies (ada) to biologics is an important reason for treatment failure in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). our aim was to assess the rate of ada, the effect of combination therapy with immunomodulators on ada and the influence of ada on efficacy and safety of biologics for ibd treatment.
methods: medline, embase and cochrane central register of controlled trials (central) were searched from inception to april 2020 for trials of biologics that assessed immunogenicity. the overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (grade). the primary outcome was rate of ada. secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety outcomes among patients with detectable versus undetectable ada. for dichotomous outcomes, pooled risk ratios (rr) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) were calculated.
results: data from 68 studies were analyzed and 33 studies (5850 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. pooled ada rates for biologic monotherapy were 28.0% for infliximab, 7.5% for adalimumab, 3.8% for golimumab, 10.9% for certolizumab, 6.2% for ustekinumab and 16.0% for natalizumab. pooled ada rates were 8.4% for vedolizumab and 5.0% for etrolizumab for combo- and monotherapy combined. in all biologics, ada rates were underestimated by use of drug-sensitive ada assays and higher dose and/or frequency. ada rate was significantly reduced in patients treated with combination therapy for infliximab (rr 0.52; 95% ci 0.44-0.62), adalimumab (rr 0.31; 95% ci 0.14-0.69), golimumab (rr 0.29; 95% ci 0.10-0.83), certolizumab pegol (rr 0.30; 95% ci 0.14-0.67) and natalizumab (rr 0.20; 95% ci 0.11-0. 39). ada to infliximab were associated with lower clinical response rates (rr 0.75; 95% ci 0.61-0.91) and higher rates of infusion reactions (rr 2.36; 95% ci 1.85-3.01).
conclusions: differences in analytical methods to detect ada hamper comparison of true ada rates across biologics in ibd. use of combination therapy with immunomodulators appeared to reduce ada positivity for most biologics. for infliximab, ada were associated with reduced drug efficacy and increased adverse events.",Bots SJ; Parker CE; Brandse JF; Löwenberg M; Feagan BG; Sandborn WJ; Jairath V; D'Haens G; Vande Casteele N,2021,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",35,6,715-733,10.1007/s40259-021-00507-5,"Bots, S.

34323292,systematic review with meta-analysis: dietary intake in adults with inflammatory bowel disease.,"background: poor dietary intake is associated with the development of malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, anaemia and osteoporosis in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. while trials are underway to manipulate the diet of people with ibd, there has been no comprehensive systematic review of the dietary intake of adults with ibd.
aims: to conduct a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the dietary intake of adults with ibd, including macronutrients, micronutrients and food group data.
methods: cinahl, embase, medline and scopus were searched from 1 january 2000 to 25 september 2020 for cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies that reported usual dietary intake in adults. data were pooled and reported as weighted mean intake for: all adults with ibd; crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; active disease; remission; males; females. a random-effects meta-analysis model compared intake with healthy individuals.
results: forty studies were identified and 19 were included in the meta-analysis. all subgroups of adults with ibd consumed inadequate energy (mean intake in adults with ibd 1980 ± 130 kcal), fibre (14 ± 4 g), folate (246 ± 33 mg) and calcium (529 ± 114 mg) per day. intake of breads and cereals, legumes, fruit, vegetables and dairy were inadequate. compared to healthy individuals, adults with ibd consume significantly less dietary fibre (smd -0.59; 95% ci: -0.73, -0.46).

38655853,systematic review and meta-analysis: impact of depression on prognosis in inflammatory bowel disease.,"background and aim: depression is highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which may affect the prognosis of ibd. this aimed to investigate the impact of depression on prognosis in ibd.
methods: a systematic literature search was performed in four databases (medline, embase, web of science, and psycinfo) up to december 31, 2023. studies were included if they investigated the impact of depression on prognosis in ibd. the primary outcome was flare in ibd, and secondary outcomes were hospitalization, readmission, emergency visits, surgery, and escalation of medical therapy. relative risks (rrs) were utilized to estimate the risk in each of the above prognostic indicators.
results: fourteen cohort and 10 case-control studies matched our entry criteria, comprising 630 408 patients with ibd. twenty-two of included studies were considered to have a low risk of bias. depression was found to significantly increase the risk of flare (rr = 1.37, 95% ci 1.16-1.63), hospitalization (rr = 1.11, 95% ci 1.00-1.23), readmission (rr = 1.32, 95% ci 1.04-1.67), emergency visits (rr = 1.33, 95% ci 1.12-1.59), surgery (1.38, 95% ci 1.08-1.76), and escalation of medical therapy (rr = 1.38, 95% ci 1.13-1.69) in ibd. of note, patients with depression in ulcerative colitis had significant differences in readmission (rr = 1.38, 95% ci 1.19-1.60) and escalation of medical therapy (rr = 1.78, 95% ci 1.55-2.04). additionally, the association was observed in patients with crohn's disease in terms of flare (rr = 1.47, 95% ci 1.08-2.01) and hospitalization (rr = 1.20, 95% ci 1.03-1.40).

34467414,association between vedolizumab and postoperative complications in ibd: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: the effect of preoperative vedolizumab (vdz) therapy on postoperative complications in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients is still controversial. this meta-analysis aims to review postoperative complications of ibd patients who preoperatively received vdz.
methods: a meta-analysis of the available literature was performed. studies of ibd patients who received vdz and non-vdz therapy (including anti-tnf-α agents, non-biological therapy, other biological agents, ustekinumab, and placebo) before surgery were included. primary outcomes included overall complications, infectious complications, and non-infectious complications.
results: twelve studies with 1925 ibd patients were enrolled, among which 709 patients received vdz treatment. the results show that, compared with non-vdz treatment, there is no significant difference in the incidence of overall complications (or = 1.25, p = 0.43) for adult ibd patients treated with vdz preoperatively, the incidence of infectious complications (or = 0.49, p = 0.001) decreases, but the risks of all surgical site infection (ssi) (crohn's disease (cd): or = 2.97, p < 0.001), superficial surgical site infection (sssi) (or = 2.24, p = 0.02), and ileus (or = 2.16, p < 0.001) increase. the risk of mucocutaneous separation (mcs) (or = 4.69, p = 0.03) with vdz is also higher than non-vdz. two studies involved pediatric patients and showed no difference in ileus (or = 0.55, p = 0.55).
conclusions: overall, compared with non-vdz treatment, preoperative use of vdz is relatively safer in adult ibd patients, which does not increase the risk of overall postoperative complications and reduces the occurrence of infectious complications. but, it increases the risk of all ssi and sssi in infectious complications and the incidence of ileus and mcs in non-infectious complications. due to lack of sufficient data, the safety of vdz in pediatric patients is uncertain and requires further study.",Guo D; Jiang K; Hong J; Zhang M; Shi Y; Zhou B,2021,International journal of colorectal disease,36,10,2081-2092,10.1007/s00384-021-04017-2,"Guo, D., Jiang, K., Hong, J., Zhang, M., Shi, Y., & Zhou, B.

32949235,characteristics of lymphoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review.,"background: lymphoma is a dreaded complication of inflammatory bowel diseases [ibd]. knowledge about lymphoma in patients with ibd is limited to epidemiological data and the description of risk factors. we performed a systematic review to describe the clinical characteristics and prognosis of lymphoma in patients with ibd.
methods: electronic databases were searched up to june 1, 2020. all published clinical characteristics of lymphoma occurring in patients with ibd were collected.
results: eleven studies were included. a total of 589 lymphomas were described in patients with ibd. as seen in de novo lymphoma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma [nhl] was the most common histological subtype [83.9%]. diffuse large b-cell lymphoma [dlbcl] and follicular lymphoma were the most well-represented nhl in patients with ibd [30% and 13% respectively]. two main differences were observed in comparison with de novo lymphoma: primary intestinal lymphoma [pil] represented a large proportion of lymphoma in patients with ibd [22-75%] whereas mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [malt] lymphoma was under-represented. epstein-barr virus [ebv]-positive status was observed in a large proportion of tumours [44-75%]. survival data of lymphoma in patients with ibd were similar to those of de novo lymphoma.
discussion: this systematic review first highlights that pil [especially dlbcl subtype] is significantly more frequent in patients with ibd and represents the most common entity. conversely, malt lymphoma is extremely rare in the ibd population. however, the overall quality of the evidence is low. further studies are required to better define lymphoma characteristics in patients with ibd.",Muller M; Broséus J; Feugier P; Thieblemont C; Beaugerie L; Danese S; Arnone D; Ndiaye NC; Kokten T; Houlgatte R; Peyrin-Biroulet L,2021,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,15,5,827-839,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa193,"Muller, M., Broséus, J., Feugier, P., Thieblemont, C., Beaugerie, L., Danese, S., Arnone, D., Ndiaye, N.

aims: to identify, synthesise and critically appraise the available evidence on the topic.
methods: we systematically searched medline/pubmed, embase and scopus, through october 2019, and recent conference proceedings, to identify studies investigating the risk of serious infections, opportunistic infections, any infection and cancer in elderly ibd patients (>60 years) exposed to biologics as compared to those unexposed to biologics. two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed each study's risk of bias. we examined heterogeneity, and calculated summary effect estimates using fixed- and random effects models. quality of evidence was determined with grade.
results: we included 15 studies (one post hoc analysis of a randomised trial, nine cohort and five case-control studies). elderly ibd patients treated with biologics were at increased risk of developing serious infections (random effects summary relative risk: 2.70, 95% ci: 1.56-4.66; seven studies; i2 = 57%) and opportunistic infections (3.16, 1.09-9.20; four studies; i2 = 73%). the occurrence of any infection (1.67, 0.51-5.43; five studies; i2 = 75%) and cancer (0.90, 0.64-1.26; nine studies; i2 = 0%) was not significantly affected. nevertheless, our confidence in the effect estimates is rather limited; the quality of evidence is low to very low.

methods: studies were identified by searching the cochrane central register of controlled trials, pubmed, scopus, web of science, and science direct from inception to february 2020. we included articles written in english that investigated the effect of trichinella infection and/or derived products in mouse models of ibd. studies were pooled, and the combined standard mean difference (smd) and 95% confidence interval (ci) were calculated using a random-effect or fixed-effect model.
results: thirteen studies were eventually included in the meta-analysis. the results indicated significant differences in the disease activity index (dai), myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, macroscopic inflammation score, and microscopic inflammation score between the experimental group and the control group. the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-4, transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β), il-10 and il-13 were significantly increased in the experimental group compared with the control group, whereas the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (ifn)-γ, il-6, tnf-α, and il-17 were significantly decreased. the percentage of regulatory t (treg) cells was also significantly increased, while the level of the m1 phenotypic macrophage marker inos was significantly decreased and the expression of the m2 phenotypic macrophage marker arg-1 was significantly increased.

39920373,bariatric surgery and relevant comorbidities: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: obesity is a growing epidemic in the united states, and with this, has come an increasing volume of metabolic surgery operations. the ideal management of obesity-associated medical conditions surrounding these operations is yet to be determined. this review sought to investigate the routine use of intraoperative cholangiogram (ioc) with cholecystectomy during or after a bypass-type operation, the ideal management of post-sleeve gastrectomy gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), and the optimal bariatric operation in patients with known inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
methods: using medical literature databases, searches were performed for randomized controlled trials (rcts) and non-randomized comparative studies from 1990 to 2022. each study was screened by two independent reviewers from the sages guidelines committee for eligibility. data were extracted while assessing the risk of bias using the cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and the newcastle-ottawa scale for rcts and cohort studies, respectively. a meta-analysis was performed using random effects.
results: routine use of ioc was associated with a significantly decreased rate of common bile duct injury and a trend towards decreased intraoperative complications, perioperative complications, and mortality. the rates of reoperation, postoperative pancreatitis, cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis were low in the routine use of the ioc group, but no non-routine use studies evaluated these outcomes. after sleeve gastrectomy, gerd-specific quality of life was significantly higher in the surgically treated group compared to the medically treated group. bypass-type operations had worse outcomes of ibd sequelae than sleeve gastrectomy, including pain, patient perception, and fistula formation. sleeve patients had lower mortality and fewer short- and long-term complications.
conclusions: low-quality data limited the conclusions that were drawn; however, trends were observed favoring the routine use of ioc during cholecystectomy for patients with bypass-type anatomy, surgical treatment of gerd post-sleeve gastrectomy, and sleeve gastrectomy in ibd patients. future research proposals are suggested to further answer the questions posed.",Wunker C; Kumar S; Hallowell P; Collings A; Loss L; Bansal V; Kushner B; Zoumpou T; Kindel TL; Overby DW; Chang J; Ayloo S; Sabour AF; Ghanem OM; Aleassa E; Reid A; Rodriguez N; Haskins IN; Hilton LR; Slater BJ; Palazzo F,2025,Surgical endoscopy,39,3,1419-1448,10.1007/s00464-025-11528-4,"Wunker, C., Kumar, S., Hallowell, P., Collings, A., Loss, L., Bansal, V., Kushner, B., Zoumpou, T., Kindel, T.

36906886,the incidence of malignancy in the residual rectum of ibd patients after colectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) who have had a total colectomy remain with their rectum in situ, and are therefore at risk of rectal carcinoma. it is not clear how high the incidence of rectal cancer is in this cohort. the primary objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate the incidence of rectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease who have undergone colectomy but have a residual rectum, and to identify the risk factors for its development. in doing so, we explore the current recommendations for screening processes for these patients.
methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed. five databases (medline, embase, pubmed, cochrane library and scopus) were searched from inception to 29 october 2021, to identify studies adhering to the population, intervention, control and outcomes (pico) criteria. the included studies were critically appraised, and the relevant data was extracted. cancer incidence was estimated from the reported information. risk stratification was analysed using revman. a narrative approach was undertaken for the exploration of the existing screening guidelines.
results: data from 23 of the 24 identified studies was suitable for analysis. the pooled incidence of rectal carcinoma was calculated to be 1.3%. subgroup analysis showed an incidence of 0.7% and 3.2% for patients with a de-functioned rectal stump and ileorectal anastomosis, respectively. patients with a history of a colorectal carcinoma were more likely to have a subsequent diagnosis of rectal carcinoma (rr 7.2, 95% ci 2.4-21.1). patients with previous colorectal dysplasia were also at higher risk (rr 5.1, 95% ci 3.1-8.2). no universal standardised guidance regarding screening for this cohort could be identified in the available literature.
conclusions: the overall risk of malignancy was estimated to be 1.3%, which is lower than previously reported. there is a need for clear and standardised screening guidance for this group of patients.",Georganta I; McIntosh S; Boldovjakova D; Parnaby CN; Watson AJM; Ramsay G,2023,Techniques in coloproctology,27,9,699-712,10.1007/s10151-023-02762-w,"Georganta, I., McIntosh, S., Boldovjakova, D., Parnaby, C.

32865278,intestinal cancer in patients with crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and aim: although surveillance colonoscopy is recommended by several guidelines for crohn's disease (cd), the evidence is insufficient to support the validity of this recommendation. moreover, the efficacy of surveillance colonoscopy for anorectal cancer remains unclear. therefore, we performed a systematic review of cancer in patients with cd before considering the proper surveillance methods.
methods: we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the incidence of intestinal cancer and a literature review to clarify the characteristic features of cancer in cd. we performed the systematic literature review of studies published up to may 2019.
results: overall, 7344 patients were included in eight studies. the standardized incidence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of colorectal cancer (crc) and small bowel cancer (sbc) were 2.08 (1.43-3.02) and 22.01 (9.10-53.25), respectively. the prevalence of crc and sbc was 57/7344 (0.77%) and 17/7344 (0.23%), respectively, during a median follow-up of 12.55 years. additionally, 54 studies reporting 208 anorectal cancer cases were identified. in patients with anorectal cancer, the prognosis for survival was 2.1 ± 2.3 years, and advanced cancer greater than stage t3 occurred in 46/74 patients (62.1%). many more reports of anorectal cancer were published in asia than in western countries.
conclusion: although we were unable to state a recommendation for surveillance for sbc, we should perform cancer surveillance for crc in patients with cd. however, the characteristics of cancer may differ according to geography or race. we must establish proper and effective surveillance methods that are independently suitable to detect these differences.",Uchino M; Ikeuchi H; Hata K; Minagawa T; Horio Y; Kuwahara R; Nakamura S; Watanabe K; Saruta M; Fujii T; Kobayashi T; Sugimoto K; Hirai F; Esaki M; Hiraoka S; Matsuoka K; Shinzaki S; Matsuura M; Inoue N; Nakase H; Watanabe M,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,2,329-336,10.1111/jgh.15229,"Uchino, M., Ikeuchi, H., Hata, K., Minagawa, T., Horio, Y., Kuwahara, R., Nakamura, S., Watanabe, K., Saruta, M., Fujii, T., Kobayashi, T., Sugimoto, K., Hirai, F., Esaki, M., Hiraoka, S., Matsuoka, K., Shinzaki, S., Matsuura, M., Inoue, N., Nakase, H., & Watanabe, M.

34157115,a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on obesity and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.,"context: there are only a few systematic reviews on the association of obesity with risk of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) to date.
objective: the current study was undertaken to systematically review prospective cohort studies on the association between body mass index (bmi) and risk of ibd. it was carried out according to the prisma (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines.
data sources: relevant prospective cohort studies published from 1969 to july 2020 were searched through pubmed, medline, scopus, embase, and google scholar, using suitable keywords.
data extraction: hazard ratios (hrs) or relative risks (rrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for ibd or its subtypes across categories of bmi were extracted.
data analysis: the log hrs/rrs, including standard errors, were calculated based on reported hrs or rrs and their 95% cis, and overall effect size was calculated using a fixed-effects model. all statistical analyses were done using stata version 14.0 (stata corp lp, college station, tx, usa).
conclusion: overall, 9 studies were included. combining findings from 5 studies, a statistically significant 21% lower risk of ulcerative colitis incidence was found in patients with obesity than in those with normal weight (rr, 0.79; 95% ci, 0.68-0.92; i2= 0.0%), but not with risk of ulcerative colitis exacerbation, as found by meta-analysis of 3 studies. pooling data from 5 studies, no significant differences were seen in the risk of crohn's disease incidence between patients in the highest range of bmi and those in the normal range. in addition, no significant nonlinear association was found between bmi and risk of crohn's disease (p=0.94). a significant inverse association was found between obesity and total ibd incidence (rr, 0.76; 95% ci, 0.66-0.88; i2=93.2%), but not between increasing bmi and ibd exacerbation, or between increasing bmi and ibd incidence.",Milajerdi A; Abbasi F; Esmaillzadeh A,2022,Nutrition reviews,80,3,479-487,10.1093/nutrit/nuab028,"Milajerdi, A., Abbasi, F., & Esmaillzadeh, A.

34453860,systematic review with meta-analysis: effect of inflammatory bowel disease therapy on lipid levels.,"background: increase in lipid levels associated with the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has previously been reported. however, it is unknown if this effect is similar for all ibd drug classes.
aim: to precisely assess the effect of different ibd drug classes on lipid profiles methods: we performed a systematic literature search of randomised controlled trials and observational cohort studies that assessed lipid levels before and after induction (≤10 weeks) and maintenance (>10 weeks) of ibd treatment. data of 11 studies (1663 patients) were pooled using random effects models. the influence of patient and disease characteristics on treatment effects on total cholesterol levels was analysed in 6 studies (1211 patients) for which individual data were available, using linear mixed models.
results: a statistically significant increase in total cholesterol was observed after induction treatment with corticosteroids (+1.19 mmol/l, 95% confidence interval [ci95 ] +0.52 to +2.59), and tofacitinib (+0.66 mmol/l, ci95 +0.42 to +0.79), but not after anti-tnfα treatment (-0.11 mmol/l, ci95 -0.26 to +0.36 mmol/l). similar differences were observed after maintenance treatment. treatment effects were significantly related to age, but not with other factors. lipid changes were inversely correlated with but not modified by crp changes.
conclusions: increase in total cholesterol levels was strongest for corticosteroids followed by tofacitinib but was not observed for anti-tnfα agents. whether total cholesterol change associated with ibd treatment has an effect on cardiovascular risk requires further study.",Sleutjes JAM; Roeters van Lennep JE; Boersma E; Menchen LA; Laudes M; Farkas K; Molnár T; Kennedy NA; Pierik MJ; van der Woude CJ; de Vries AC,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,8,999-1012,10.1111/apt.16580,"Sleutjes, J.

objective: we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies to determine (i) the pooled prevalence of ibd in hs cohorts, and (ii) whether hs is more strongly associated with crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
methods: electronic searches were performed using five databases, from their inception to august 2018. case-control studies reporting the proportion of ibd cases in hs cohorts were included and meta-analysis performed.
results: from six included studies, a significant association between hs and ibd after pooling of adjusted effect sizes was identified (or 2.12; 95% ci 1.62-2.77; p = 0.03). subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant association between hs and crohn's disease (or 2.25; 95% ci 1.52-3.32; p < 0.0001, i2 = 92%) and with ulcerative colitis (or 1.56; 95% ci 1.26-1.94; p < 0.0001; i2 = 36%).
limitations: studies reviewed were observational by design which are susceptible to bias and lack of randomization.

35908208,a systematic review of the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) on family members.,"background and aims: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) affects patients and their family members, but most reviews have focused only on patients themselves. this review synthesises evidence on the impact of ibd on family members.
methods: a systematic review was undertaken, searching six bibliographic databases, focusing on the impact of ibd on family members, coping strategies, and interventions. a narrative synthesis was conducted. this review was reported following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (prisma).
results: 3258 records were identified; 33 papers (2748 participants) were included. three themes were identified: impact of ibd on family members; coping strategies for family members to overcome the impact of ibd; and the support needed by family members. ibd affects family members' well-being in many ways, including their emotional well-being, relationship with the patient, social life, work and finances, and leisure time and travel. family members use adaptive coping patterns such as acceptance, developing resilience, and emotional support from others. maladaptive coping patterns such as denial of diagnosis, self-distraction, and self-blame were also evident. family members reported that they needed better information about ibd, support groups, and better access to a counsellor or psychologist. no studies assessed interventions to relieve family members' burden.
conclusions: family members of ibd patients require psychosocial support to facilitate better family function, cohesion, and enhanced coping strategies. healthcare services should adopt a multidisciplinary care model with a bio-psycho-social approach including an ibd nurse, family therapist, and psychologist, to improve quality of life for patients and their families.",Thapwong P; Norton C; Rowland E; Farah N; Czuber-Dochan W,2023,Journal of clinical nursing,32,9-10,2228-2238,10.1111/jocn.16446,"Thapwong, P., Norton, C., Rowland, E., Farah, N., & Czuber-Dochan, W.

objective: this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the impact of telemedicine with that of standard care on the management of ibd.
methods: we systematically searched the pubmed, cochrane library, embase, web of science, and scopus databases on april 22, 2020. randomized controlled trials comparing telemedicine with standard care in patients with ibd were included, while conference abstracts, letters, reviews, laboratory studies, and case reports were excluded. the ibd-specific quality of life (qol), disease activity, and remission rate in patients with ibd were assessed as primary outcomes, and the number of in-person clinic visits per patient, patient satisfaction, psychological outcome, and medication adherence were assessed as secondary outcomes. review manage 5.3 and stata 15.1 were used for data analysis.
results: a total of 17 randomized controlled trials (2571 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. the telemedicine group had higher ibd-specific qol than the standard care group (standard mean difference 0.18, 95% ci 0.01 to 0.34; p.03). the number of clinic visits per patient in the telemedicine group was significantly lower than that in the standard care group (standard mean difference -0.71, 95% ci -1.07 to -0.36; p<.001). subgroup analysis showed that adolescents in the telemedicine group had significantly higher ibd-specific qol than those in the standard care group (standard mean difference 0.42, 95% ci 0.15 to 0.69; i2=0; p.002), but there was no significant difference between adults in the 2 groups. there were no significant differences in disease activity, remission rate, patient satisfaction, depression, self-efficacy, generic qol, and medication adherence outcomes between the telemedicine and standard care groups.
conclusions: telemedicine intervention showed a promising role in improving ibd-specific qol among adolescents and decreased the number of clinic visits among patients with ibd. further research is warranted to identify the group of patients with ibd who would most benefit from telemedicine.",Pang L; Liu H; Liu Z; Tan J; Zhou LY; Qiu Y; Lin X; He J; Li X; Lin S; Ghosh S; Mao R; Chen M,2022,Journal of medical Internet research,24,3,e28978,10.2196/28978,"Pang, L., Liu, H., Liu, Z., Tan, J., Zhou, L.

36738845,myocarditis and inflammatory bowel diseases: a single-center experience and a systematic literature review.,"background: myocarditis and inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) are rare conditions, but may coexist. myocarditis in ibd may be infective, immune-mediated, or due to mesalamine toxicity. a gap of knowledge exists on the clinical features of patients that present myocarditis in association with ibd, especially for endomyocardial biopsy-proven cases. our aims are: 1) to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with an associated diagnosis of myocarditis and ibd in a single-center hospital, 2) to perform a systematic review of the literature of analogous cases.
methods: we retrospectively analyzed data of patients followed up at the outpatient cardio-immunology and gastroenterology clinic of padua university hospital, to identify those with an associated diagnosis of myocarditis and ibd. in addition, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. we performed a qualitative analysis of the overall study population.
results: the study included 104 patients (21 from our single center cohort, 83 from the literature review). myocarditis in ibd more frequently affects young (median age 31 years) males (72%), predominantly with infarct-like presentation (58%), within an acute phase of the ibd (67%) and with an overall benign clinical course (87%). nevertheless, a not negligible quote of patients may present giant cell myocarditis, deserve immunosuppression and have a chronic, or even fatal course. histological evidence of mesalamine hypersensitivity is scarce and its incidence may be overestimated.
conclusions: our study shows that myocarditis in association with ibd, if correctly managed, may have a spontaneous benign course, but predictors of worse prognosis must be promptly recognized.",Giordani AS; Candelora A; Fiacca M; Cheng C; Barberio B; Baritussio A; Marcolongo R; Iliceto S; Carturan E; De Gaspari M; Rizzo S; Basso C; Tarantini G; Savarino EV; Alp C,2023,International journal of cardiology,376,,165-171,10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.01.071,"Giordani, A.

36789751,safety analysis of preoperative anti-tnf-α therapy in pediatric ibd after intestinal resection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: biological agents have transformed the management of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, intestinal resection is still unavoidable in complicated ibd. it is still under debate whether antitumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α is related to higher postoperative complications in children with ibd. therefore, we aimed to analyze data on preoperative anti-tnf-α and postoperative complications in pediatric ibd.
methods: we conducted a systematic literature search in 4 databases for studies that compared the incidence of postoperative complications between children with ibd who received anti-tnf-α treatment within 12 weeks prior to intestinal resection and who did not receive anti-tnf-α before the operation. to analyze this question, pooled odds ratios (ors) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (cis). odds ratios higher than 1 mean higher complication rate among children treated with preoperative anti-tnf-α, whereas an or lower than 1 means lower complication rate. the i2 value was calculated to measure the strength of the between-study heterogeneity, where a smaller percentage means the lower heterogeneity.
results: we found 8 eligible articles with 526 pediatric patients with ibd. the primary outcome was the overall complication. the pooled or of overall complications was 1.38 (95% ci, 0.10-18.76; p = .65; i2 = 34%) in contrast, the or of infectious and noninfectious complications were 0.59 (95% ci, 0.21-1.69; p = .16; i2 = 0%) and 0.48 (95% ci, 0.18-1.25; p = .09; i2 = 0%), although both showed a nonsignificant result.

data sources: we searched medline, embase, cinahl, scopus, and pubmed databases up to december 27, 2023. we also screened reference lists of identified studies and utilized scopus to find additional relevant research.
study eligibility criteria: we included studies that specifically examined ssz/5-asa usage during pregnancy. our outcomes of interest included congenital malformations, stillbirths, neonatal outcomes, preterm delivery, live births, small for gestational age, and pregnancy loss.
synthesis methods: pooled odds ratios (or) were calculated using a random-effects model to accommodate within-study and between-study variability, given the substantial heterogeneity from differences in study designs and methodologies. the risk of bias was assessed using the newcastle-ottawa scale (nos).
results: fifteen observational studies with 2,076,932 participants were included. ssz/5-asa use during pregnancy was linked to a significant increase in congenital malformations (or: 1.33, 95 % ci: 1.17-1.50), stillbirths (or: 5.12, 95 % ci: 2.74-9.57), and preterm delivery (or: 1.94, 95 % ci: 1.49-2.52) compared to healthy controls. however, no significant risks were found when compared with pregnant women with ibd not on medication.

methods: pubmed, embase and cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched until 24 december, 2021, to identify studies that reported pathological results of follow-up colonoscopy or surgery in ibd patients with ind and lgd. the main outcomes were the incidence and risk factors for advanced neoplasia in ibd patients with ind and lgd.
results: based on the analysis of 38 studies, the pooled incidences of advanced neoplasia in ibd patients with ind and lgd were 9.9% (95% ci 4.4%-15.4%) and 10.7% (95% ci 7.0%-14.4%) respectively. the risk factors for advanced neoplasia in ind patients were primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) and aneuploidy. the risk factors for advanced neoplasia in lgd patients included male, psc, previous ind, colonic stricture, index lesion ≥1 cm, distal location, multifocal lesions, distal and flat lesions, nonpolypoid/flat lesions and invisible lesions.
conclusions: the incidence of advanced neoplasia was similar between ind and lgd in ibd patients, as high as one in ten, so more rigorous surveillance is also suggested in ind patients. since the effects of most factors were derived from the pooled results of only two to three studies, further research was needed to confirm our results.",Wan J; Wang X; Zhang Y; Chen M; Wang M; Wu K; Liang J,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,6,632-644,10.1111/apt.16789,"Wan, J., Wang, X., Zhang, Y., Chen, M., Wang, M., Wu, K., & Liang, J.

40051767,systematic review and meta-analysis of post-traumatic stress disorder as a risk factor for multiple autoimmune diseases.,"background: post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is a prevalent and debilitating psychiatric illness that has been linked to poor health outcomes and increased risk of developing chronic health conditions, including multiple autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and multiple sclerosis (ms).
aim: this meta-analysis assesses the epidemiological research in this field and briefly explores the hypothesized neurobiological and immunological mechanisms that may underlie the association between ptsd and the development of autoimmune disease.
methods: pubmed, scopus, and cochrane reviews databases were searched for all relevant articles in august 2023. studies were systematically screened for relevance and inclusion criteria by two reviewers before quality assessment and data extraction were performed. fixed and random-effect meta-analyses were performed to evaluate ptsd as a risk factor for the development of specific autoimmune diseases. subgroup analyses examining the roles of biological sex and ptsd severity were also performed.
results: the initial search yielded 3010 articles where only eight prospective and retrospective cohort studies met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. these eight studies were subdivided based on specific disease outcomes. random effects model for risk of developing any autoimmune disease in persons with ptsd vs. control was 1.291 (95% ci = 1.179 to 1.412; p <0.001; n=1,984,310; 4 studies included). the strength of the association between ptsd and risk of developing specific autoimmune diseases varied by outcome condition from 1.142 (95% ci = 1.085 to 1.202, p <0.001) for risk of ibd to 1.302 (1.037 to 1.635, p = 0.023) for risk of ms. random effects models showed statistically significant associations between ptsd and ibd, sle, ra, ms, and thyroiditis.
conclusion: these results suggest that the risk for developing autoimmune conditions, including sle, ms, ra, and ibd, is significantly increased in the setting of ptsd. this association may have important implications on clinical practice and research into the pathophysiology of stress disorders.",Mandagere K; Stoy S; Hammerle N; Zapata I; Brooks B,2025,Frontiers in psychiatry,16,,1523994,10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1523994,"Mandagere, K., Stoy, S., Hammerle, N., Zapata, I., & Brooks, B.

39229260,lymphocyte subsets for predicting inflammatory bowel disease progression and treatment response: a systematic review.,"background: lymphocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and are widely explored as promising prognostic indicators. we aimed to outline the existing evidences on the capability of lymphocyte subpopulations to predict disease progression and treatment response in patients with ibd.
methods: the protocol for this review was registered in prospero (registration id: crd 42022364126). systematic retrieval was conducted using pubmed, embase, and web of science databases. original articles on the prognostic value of lymphocyte subsets in ibd published up to april 8, 2023 were eligible for inclusion. the newcastle-ottawa scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias.
results: twenty studies were ultimately included: eight evaluated the prediction of disease progression and 12 focused on the prediction of treatment response. according to the newcastle-ottawa scale, three studies were of high quality, 16 were of moderate quality, and only one was of low quality. t-cell subpopulations, including cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells, and γδ t cells, are revealed to have prognostic capacity. transmembrane tumor necrosis factor α-bearing lymphocytes, cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells, and plasma cells are found to have the potential to predict the response to anti-tnfα agents. in contrast memory t cells, cd4+ t cells, and naïve b cells may predict the response to vedolizumab.
conclusions: this systematic review identified several potential lymphocyte subset-related predictors. if verified in large cohort prospective studies, these findings could aid clinical decision-making.

34492100,machine learning-based prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis in inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review.,"background and aims: there is increasing interest in machine learning-based prediction models in inflammatory bowel diseases [ibd]. we synthesised and critically appraised studies comparing machine learning vs traditional statistical models, using routinely available clinical data for risk prediction in ibd.
methods: through a systematic review till january 1, 2021, we identified cohort studies that derived and/or validated machine learning models, based on routinely collected clinical data in patients with ibd, to predict the risk of harbouring or developing adverse clinical outcomes, and reported its predictive performance against a traditional statistical model for the same outcome. we appraised the risk of bias in these studies using the prediction model risk of bias assessment [probast] tool.
results: we included 13 studies on machine learning-based prediction models in ibd, encompassing themes of predicting treatment response to biologics and thiopurines and predicting longitudinal disease activity and complications and outcomes in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis. the most common machine learning models used were tree-based algorithms, which are classification approaches achieved through supervised learning. machine learning models outperformed traditional statistical models in risk prediction. however, most models were at high risk of bias, and only one was externally validated.
conclusions: machine learning-based prediction models based on routinely collected data generally perform better than traditional statistical models in risk prediction in ibd, though frequently have high risk of bias. future studies examining these approaches are warranted, with special focus on external validation and clinical applicability.",Nguyen NH; Picetti D; Dulai PS; Jairath V; Sandborn WJ; Ohno-Machado L; Chen PL; Singh S,2022,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,16,3,398-413,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab155,"Nguyen, N.

36454911,effects of structured exercise programmes on physiological and psychological outcomes in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd): a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: exercise has been suggested to counteract specific complications of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, its role as a therapeutic option remains poorly understood. therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of exercise in ibd.
methods: five databases (medline, embase, cinahl, central and sportdiscus) and three registers (clinicaltrials.gov, who ictrp and isrctn) were searched from inception to september 2022, for studies assessing the effects of structured exercise of at least 4 weeks duration on physiological and/or psychological outcomes in adults with ibd. two independent reviewers screened records, assessed risk of bias using the cochrane risk of bias (rob 2.0) and robins-i tools, and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the grade method. data were meta-analysed using a random-effects model.
results: from 4,123 citations, 15 studies (9 rcts) were included, comprising of 637 participants (36% male). pooled evidence from six rcts indicated that exercise improved disease activity (smd = -0.44; 95% ci [-0.82 to -0.07]; p = 0.02), but not disease-specific quality of life (qol) (ibdq total score; md = 3.52; -2.00 to 9.04; p = 0.21) when compared to controls. although meta-analysis could not be performed for other outcomes, benefits were identified in fatigue, muscular function, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, bone mineral density and psychological well-being. fourteen exercise-related non-serious adverse events occurred. the overall certainty of evidence was low for disease activity and very low for hrqol as a result of downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision.
conclusions: structured exercise programmes improve disease activity, but not disease-specific qol. defining an optimal exercise prescription and synthesis of evidence in other outcomes, was limited by insufficient well-designed studies to ascertain the true effect of exercise training. this warrants further large-scale randomised trials employing standard exercise prescription to verify this effect to enable the implementation into clinical practice.

33002235,does anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha prevent the recurrence of crohn's disease? systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and aim: anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) α agents are now well known to function as effective treatments for crohn's disease (cd). several meta-analyses have revealed the efficacy of anti-tnf therapy for preventing recurrence after surgery; however, the efficacies reported in some prospective studies differed according to the outcomes. moreover, adverse events (aes) were not well evaluated. we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate both the efficacy of anti-tnf therapy after stratification by the outcome of interest and the aes.
methods: we performed a systematic literature review of studies investigating anti-tnf therapy, cd, and postoperative recurrence. meta-analyses were performed for endoscopic and clinical recurrence and aes.
results: a total of 570 participants, including 254 patients in the intervention group and 316 patients in the control group, in eight studies, were analyzed for recurrence. based on the results of the meta-analysis, the efficacies of anti-tnf therapy at preventing endoscopic and clinical recurrence were as follows: relative risk (rr) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.53 and rr 0.60, 95% ci 0.36-1.02, respectively. the rr of aes with anti-tnf therapy was 1.75 (95% ci 0.81-3.79).
conclusions: anti-tnf therapy after surgery for cd displays efficacy at preventing endoscopic recurrence for 1-2 years, without increasing the incidence of aes. however, clinical recurrence was not significantly reduced. the efficacy of postoperative anti-tnf therapy may differ in terms of the outcomes, which include long-term prevention, the avoidance of further surgery, and cost-effectiveness.",Uchino M; Ikeuchi H; Hata K; Minagawa T; Horio Y; Kuwahara R; Nakamura S; Watanabe K; Saruta M; Fujii T; Kobayashi T; Sugimoto K; Hirai F; Esaki M; Hiraoka S; Matsuoka K; Shinzaki S; Matsuura M; Inoue N; Nakase H; Watanabe M,2021,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,36,4,864-872,10.1111/jgh.15288,"Uchino, M., Ikeuchi, H., Hata, K., Minagawa, T., Horio, Y., Kuwahara, R., Nakamura, S., Watanabe, K., Saruta, M., Fujii, T., Kobayashi, T., Sugimoto, K., Hirai, F., Esaki, M., Hiraoka, S., Matsuoka, K., Shinzaki, S., Matsuura, M., Inoue, N., Nakase, H., & Watanabe, M.

35300336,incidence of and risk factors for paradoxical psoriasis or psoriasiform lesions in inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving anti-tnf therapy: systematic review with meta-analysis.,"background: paradoxical psoriasis or psoriasiform lesions induced by anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-tnf) therapies receive increasing attention worldwide. however, no comprehensive meta-analysis investigating the incidence estimates and risk factors for anti-tnf-induced psoriasis is currently available. we aimed to precisely quantify its incidence as well as risk factors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
methods: this study was registered on prospero database under review registration number crd42021233695. the electronic databases pubmed, embase, and the cochrane library were comprehensively searched for observational studies published as full-length papers in english and reporting the incidence and/or predictors for psoriasis or psoriasiform lesions in ibd patients. a random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled incidence. pooled odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval for potential predictors were combined using a fixed-effects or random-effects model.
results: in total, 30 articles comprising 24,547 ibd patients treated by anti-tnf were finally included. the overall pooled incidence of psoriasis and/or psoriasiform lesions following anti-tnf therapy was 6.0% (5.0-7.0%; i2 = 93.9%), with 6.9% (5.1-8.7%; i2 = 92.4%) for psoriasiform lesions and 4.6% (3.6-5.6%; i2 = 93.9%) for psoriasis. multivariable meta-regression analysis indicated regions and populations that significantly contributed to the heterogeneity. a statistically higher risk for psoriasis or psoriasiform lesions during anti-tnf therapy was observed in female patients (or 1.46, 1.23-1.73), those who are at a younger age at anti-tnf initiation (or 1.03, 1.00-1.05), smokers (or 1.97, 1.56-2.48), ileocolonic crohn's disease patients (or 1.48, 1.03-2.13), and those who are using adalimumab or certolizumab (vs. infliximab) (or: 1.48 and 2.87 respectively).
conclusions: the incidence of psoriasis or psoriasiform lesions was not uncommon in ibd patients following anti-tnf therapy. female, younger age, smoker, ileocolonic crohn's disease, and the types of anti-tnf were significantly associated with such risk. these findings may help gastroenterologists to make more individualized decisions and understand the mechanisms of this paradoxical phenomenon.

32889976,systematic review and meta-analysis of dermatological reactions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy.,"aim: the role of anti-tumour necrosis factor (tnf) medications in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is now established. recent studies have reported the incidence of dermatological adverse events with use of anti-tnfs in ibd. the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of dermatological reactions in patients on anti-tnf therapy for ibd.
methods: we searched medline, the cochrane library and embase to identify studies reporting any dermatological reaction in patients exposed to anti-tnf for treatment of ibd. the incidence of dermatological complications in the entire review population was pooled by meta-analysis of data from individual studies using the random effects model. pooled estimates in male and female patients and in patients treated with different anti-tnf agents were also calculated. we applied mixed effects (methods of moments) regression models to investigate between-study heterogeneity.
results: forty-eight studies reporting a total of 29 776 patients treated with anti-tnf medications for ibd were identified. gender distribution was available for 18 960 participants with 45.3% females. data on type of disease were available for 20 226 patients: 74.9% (n = 15 154) crohn's disease, 24.2% (n = 4901) ulcerative colitis and 0.9% (n = 171) ibd-unclassified. the type of anti-tnf used was mentioned for 17 085 individuals: 67.5% (n = 11 530) infliximab (ifx), 30.5% (n = 5203) adalimumab (ada), 1.7% (n = 296) certolizumab and 0.3% (n = 56) golimumab. the pooled incidence of any dermatological reaction from 26 studies was 19.4% [95% confidence interval (ci): 15.2-24.4]. the pooled incidence for ifx and ada was 23.7% (95% ci: 17.8-30.8) from 12 studies and 33.3% (95% ci 18.8-51.1) from seven studies, respectively. we found a trend of increased event rate with increasing percentage of male population (p = 0.08). the commonest reported event (39 studies) was psoriasis/psoriasiform rash with a pooled incidence of 5.6% (95% ci: 4.2-7.4). the incidence of psoriasis/psoriasiform rashes for ifx and ada was 6.1% (95% ci 3.4-10.6) from 15 studies and 5.9% (95% ci: 2.5-13.5) from seven studies, respectively. other reactions reported included eczema with a pooled incidence of 5.5% (95% ci: 3.3-8.9) from 17 studies and skin infections with pooled incidence of 7.9% (95% ci: 5.5-11.2) from 11 studies.
conclusion: the incidence of dermatological events in patients with ibd treated with anti-tnf medications is high. the most commonly reported reaction is psoriasis/psoriasiform reaction. clinicians should be vigilant to dermatological side effects following treatment of ibd with anti-tnf.",Nigam GB; Bhandare AP; Antoniou GA; Limdi JK,2021,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,33,3,346-357,10.1097/MEG.0000000000001917,"Nigam, G.

36495020,meta-analysis: the efficacy of therapeutic drug monitoring of anti-tnf-therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.,"background and aims: this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (tdm) in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients on anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-tnf) therapy results in improved rates of clinical and endoscopic remission, surgery, corticosteroid-free remission and hospitalisation.
methods: medline, embase, embase classic, pubmed, cochrane central databases register of controlled trials and cochrane specialised trials register were searched between 01 janurary 1946 and 08 april 2022. randomised controlled trials (rcts) and prospective and retrospective observational studies were included, comparing tdm to standard of care (soc) or reactive vs proactive tdm. results were reported as pooled relative risks (rr) with 95% confidence intervals (95% ci).
results: twenty-six studies, including 9 rcts, were included. compared to soc, proactive tdm was associated with a significantly decreased risk of treatment failure (rr 0.64, 95% ci 0.48-0.85 p<0.01), and a non-significant decrease in need for surgery (rr 0.51, 95% ci 0.25-1.02) and hospitalisation (rr 0.64, 95% ci 0.40-1.00). furthermore compared to soc, proactive tdm was associated with higher rates of endoscopic remission (rr 1.19, 95% ci 0.93-1.53) and clinical remission (rr 1.07, 95% ci 0.97-1.18). compared to reactive tdm, proactive tdm was associated with significant decreased risk of treatment failure (rr 0.46, 95% ci 0.21 = 0.98, p = 0.04) and significant reduction in hospitalisation (rr 0.33, 95% ci 0.21-0.54, p < 0.01).
conclusions: compared to soc, proactive tdm was associated with significant benefit in reducing treatment failure. compared to reactive tdm, proactive tdm led to a significant reduction in hospitalisation and treatment failure. more studies with larger rcts and standardised assays are needed to substantiate these results and validate the cost-effectiveness of tdm.",Sethi S; Dias S; Kumar A; Blackwell J; Brookes MJ; Segal JP,2023,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,57,12,1362-1374,10.1111/apt.17313,"Sethi, S., Dias, S., Kumar, A., Blackwell, J., Brookes, M.

38206197,efficacy and safety of biologics in primary sclerosing cholangitis with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) is an immune-mediated, chronic cholestatic liver disease. currently, liver transplantation is the only established life-saving treatment. several studies have evaluated the effect of different biologic therapies on psc with inconclusive findings. we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of biologics in psc and associated inflammatory bowel disease (ibd).
methods: medline, scopus, and embase were searched up to july 31, 2023, for studies reporting the effects of biologics in patients with psc-ibd. effects of biologic therapy on alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, ulcerative colitis response score, and adverse events were calculated and expressed as standardized difference of means (smd), proportions, and 95% ci using a random-effects model.
results: six studies, including 411 psc-ibd patients who received biologics, were included. biologic treatment was associated with no change in alkaline phosphatase (smd: 0.1, 95% ci: -0.07 -0.17, p=0.43), but a small and statistically significant increase in total bilirubin (smd: 0.2, 95% ci: 0.05-0.35, p<0.01). 31.2% (95% ci: 23.8-39.7) of patients with ibd achieved endoscopic response, and there was a significant improvement in ulcerative colitis response score (smd: -0.6,95% ci: -0.88 to 0.36, p<0.01). furthermore, 17.6% (95% ci: 13.0-23.5) of patients experienced adverse events severe enough to discontinue therapy, and 29.9% (95% ci: 25.2-34.8) had a loss of response to biologics.
conclusions: treatment of patients with psc-ibd with biologics (vedolizumab, infliximab, and adalimumab) was not associated with improvement of biochemical markers of cholestasis. biologics are effective in treating the colitis associated with psc. vedolizumab was associated with worsening liver enzymes in contrast to other biologics, a finding that warrants further study.",Shah A; Jones MP; Callaghan G; Fairlie T; Ma X; Culver EL; Stuart K; De Cruz P; O'Beirne J; Tabibian JH; Dignass A; Canbay A; Gores GJ; Holtmann GJ,2024,Hepatology communications,8,1,,10.1097/HC9.0000000000000347,"Shah, A., Jones, M.

34913897,survival outcomes and clinicopathological features in inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"objective: the aim of our study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the survival outcomes of ibd-associated and non-ibd-associated crc.
summary of background data: investigations comparing the prognosis in crc patients with and without ibd have yielded conflicting results.
methods: pubmed/medline, embase, web of science, cochrane library were searched for studies evaluating the prognostic outcomes between crc patients with ibd and those without ibd. estimates of survival-related outcomes and clinicopathological features in ibd-crc and non-ibd crc were pooled through random-effects or fix-effects models. the study is registered with prospero, crd42021261513.
results: of 12,768 records identified, twenty-five studies with 8034 ibd-crc and 810,526 non-ibd crc patients were included in the analysis. ibd-crc patients have a significant worse overall survival (os) with the hazard ratio (hr) of 1.33 [95% confidence interval (ci): 1.20-1.47] than those without ibd. pooled estimates of cancer-specific survival demonstrated that ibd-crc patients had a poorer cancer-specific survival than those without ibd with fixed-effect model (hr, 2.17; 95% ci: 1.68-2.78; p < 0.0001). moreover, ulcerative colitis-associated crc patients have favorable os than crohn's disease-associated crc (hr 0.79,95% ci: 0.72-0.87). compared to non-ibd-crc, patients with ibd-associated crc are characterized by an increased rate of poor differentiation (or 2.02, 95% ci: 1.57-2.61), mucinous or signet ring cell carcinoma (or 2.43, 95% ci: 1.34-4.42), synchronous tumors (or 3.18, 95% ci: 2.26-4.47), right-sided crc (or 1.62, 95%ci: 1.05-2.05), male patients (or 1.10, 95% ci: 1.05-1.16), and a reduced rate of r0 resections (or 0.60, 95% ci: 0.44-0.82).
conclusions: ibd-crc patients have a significant worse os than patients with non-ibd crc, which may be attributed to more aggressive histological characteristics and a lower rate of r0 resections at the primary tumor site. optimized therapeutic standards and tailored follow-up strategies might improve the prognosis of ibd-crc patients.",Lu C; Schardey J; Zhang T; Crispin A; Wirth U; Karcz KW; Bazhin AV; Andrassy J; Werner J; Kühn F,2022,Annals of surgery,276,5,e319-e330,10.1097/SLA.0000000000005339,"Lu, C., Schardey, J., Zhang, T., Crispin, A., Wirth, U., Karcz, K.

38926222,efficacy and safety of endoscopic stricturotomy in inflammatory bowel disease-related strictures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background and aim: luminal strictures, common in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), especially crohn's disease (cd), are typically treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation (ebd). the newer endoscopic stricturotomy (est) approach shows promise, but data is limited. this systematic review and meta-analysis assess the effectiveness and safety of est in ibd-related strictures.
methods: a comprehensive literature search was conducted until november 2023 for studies assessing est efficacy and safety in ibd. primary outcomes were clinical and technical success, with secondary endpoints covering adverse events, subsequent stricture surgery, additional endoscopic treatments (est or ebd), medication escalation, disease-related emergency department visits, and hospitalization post-est. technical success was defined as passing the scope through the stricture, and clinical success was defined as symptom improvement. single-arm meta-analysis (cma version 3) calculated the event rate per patient with a 95% confidence interval (ci). heterogeneity was evaluated using i2.
results: nine studies were included, involving 640 est procedures on 287 ibd patients (169 cd, 118 ulcerative colitis). of these, 53.3% were men, with a mean age of 43.3 ± 14.3 years and a mean stricture length of 1.68 ± 0.84 cm. the technical success rate was 96.4% (95% ci 92.5-98.3, p-value < 0.0001), and the clinical success rate was 62% (95% ci 52.2-70.9, p-value = 0.017, i2 = 34.670). the bleeding rate was 10.5% per patient, and the perforation rate was 3.5%. after an average follow-up of 0.95 ± 1.1 years, 16.4% required surgery for strictures post-est, while 44.2% needed additional endoscopic treatment. the medication escalation rate after est was 14.7%. the disease-related emergency department visit rate was 14.7%, and the disease-related hospitalization rate post-procedure was 21.3%.

32628745,systematic review with meta-analysis: the impact of co-occurring immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on the disease course of inflammatory bowel diseases.,"background and aims: patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) are at risk of developing a variety of other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (imids). the influence of co-occurring imids on the disease course of ibd remains unknown. the aim of this study was therefore to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of imids on phenotypic presentation and outcome in patients with ibd.
methods: pubmed and embase were searched from their earliest records through december 2018 and updated in october 2019 for studies reporting proportions or ratios of ibd-related disease outcomes in patients with and without co-occurring imids. meta-analyses were performed to estimate summary proportions and risks of the main outcomes. prisma guidelines were used, and study quality was assessed according to the newcastle-ottawa scale.
results: a total of 93 studies were identified, comprising 16,064 ibd patients with co-occurring imids and 3,451,414 ibd patients without imids. patients with ibd and co-occurring imids were at increased risk of having extensive colitis or pancolitis (risk ratio, 1.38; 95% cl, 1.25-1.52; p < 0.01, i2 = 86%) and receiving ibd-related surgeries (risk ratio, 1.17; 95% cl, 1.01-1.36; p = 0.03; i2 = 85%) compared with patients without imids. co-occurrence of imids other than primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with ibd was associated with an increased risk of receiving immunomodulators (risk ratio, 1.15; 95% cl, 1.06-1.24; p < 0.01; i2 = 60%) and biologic therapies (risk ratio, 1.19; 95% cl, 1.08-1.32; p < 0.01; i2 = 53%).

34678884,the incidence of psoriasis among smokers and/or former smokers inflammatory bowel diseases patients treated with tumor necrosis factor antagonist: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"background: infliximab (ifx) and adalimumab (ada) refer to the classic drugs to treat moderate-severe inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which have been proven to be effective to control ibd. however, the side effects exerted by ifx and ada should be monitored in therapies, especially the paradoxical reaction of the skin system (e.g., psoriasis). psoriasis is recognized as the most common skin lesion, capable of significantly affecting the quality of patients' life.
methods: this study searched literatures published in english language with the qualifications on pubmed, embase, web of science, google, and geenmedical databases. over 2 co-authors assessed the quality of the articles and extracted the data independently. the data acquired were statistically analyzed with the statistical software of revman and stata.
results: the ada group achieved a higher incidence of psoriasis (odds ratio [or] = 0.658, 95% confidence interval [ci] [0.471-0.919]); females achieved a higher incidence of psoriasis than males (or = 1.941, 95%ci [1.326-2.843], p < .05); smoking up-regulated the incidence of psoriasis (or = 1.679, 95%ci [1.237-2.279], p < .05); the interval of medication was over 1 year, and the interval of medication applying ifx was longer than that of the ada group; most cases could be relieved by using local hormone, phototherapy, or systemic hormone therapy under the strategy of biological agents.

39292973,systematic review with meta-analysis of the effectiveness of subcutaneous biologics versus intravenous biologics in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"background: biologic therapies are commonly used for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. multiple biologic medicines can now be given both intravenously and subcutaneously. the different administration routes present provide different advantages regarding dose escalation, healthcare resource utilisation, pharmacokinetics, convenience and safety. comparator effectiveness studies between intravenous and subcutaneous administration are lacking.
aim: our primary outcome was to compare the effectiveness between intravenous and subcutaneous biologics in rates of clinical remission.
methods: we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to include all relevant articles from medline ( ovid ), embase , pubmed and cochrane central register of controlled trials from 1 january 2003 to 28 january 2024. studies that compared intravenous and subcutaneous administration of the same biologic therapy in ibd patients and reported effectiveness outcomes were included. this study was registered on prospero (crd42023442675).
results: twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. nine vedolizumab cohort studies were meta-analysed for clinical remission and no difference was found in clinical remission rates between intravenous and subcutaneous administration (relative risk = 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.11). six infliximab cohort studies were meta-analysed for clinical remission and no difference was found in clinical remission rates between intravenous and subcutaneous administration (relative risk = 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 1.08).

39031224,innovating thiopurine therapeutic drug monitoring: a systematic review and meta-analysis on dna-thioguanine nucleotides (dna-tg) as an inclusive biomarker in thiopurine therapy.,"background and objective: thioguanine (tg), azathioprine (aza), and mercaptopurine (mp) are thiopurine prodrugs commonly used to treat diseases, such as leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-tgns) have been commonly used for monitoring treatment. high levels of 6-tgns in red blood cells (rbcs) have been associated with leukopenia, the cutoff levels that predict this side effect remain uncertain. thiopurines are metabolized and incorporated into leukocyte dna. measuring levels of dna-incorporated thioguanine (dna-tg) may be a more suitable method for predicting clinical response and toxicities such as leukopenia. unfortunately, most methodologies to assay 6-tgns are unable to identify the impact of nudt15 variants, effecting mostly ethnic populations (e.g., chinese, indian, malay, japanese, and hispanics). dna-tg tackles this problem by directly measuring thioguanine in the dna, which can be influenced by both tpmt and nudt15 variants. while rbc 6-tgn concentrations have traditionally been used to optimize thiopurine therapy due to their ease and affordability of measurement, recent developments in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) techniques have made measuring dna-tg concentrations in lymphocytes accurate, reproducible, and affordable. the objective of this systematic review was to assess the current evidence of dna-tg levels as marker for thiopurine therapy, especially with regards to nudt15 variants.
methods: a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the current evidence for dna-tg as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy, including methods for measurement and the illustrative relationship between dna-tg and various gene variants (such as tpmt, nudt15, itpa, nt5c2, and mrp4). pubmed and embase were systematically searched up to april 2024 for published studies, using the keyword ""dna-tg"" with mesh terms and synonyms. the electronic search strategy was augmented by a manual examination of references cited in articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. a meta-analysis was performed using r studio 4.1.3. to investigate the difference between the coefficients (fisher's z-transformed correlation coefficient) of dna-tg and 6-tgns levels. a meta-analysis was performed using revman version 5.4 to investigate the difference in dna-tg levels between patients with or without leukopenia using randomized effect size model. the risk of bias was assessed using the newcastle-ottowa quality assessment scale.
results: in this systematic review, 21 studies were included that measured dna-tg levels in white blood cells for either patients with all (n = 16) or ibd (n = 5). in our meta-analysis, the overall mean difference between patients with leukopenia (all + ibd) versus no leukopenia was 134.15 fmol tg/μg dna [95% confidence interval (ci) (83.78-184.35), p < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 5.62, i2 of 47%]. there was a significant difference in dna-tg levels for patients with ibd with and without leukopenia [161.76 fmol tg/μg dna; 95% ci (126.23-197.29), p < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 0.20, i2 of 0%]. no significant difference was found in dna-tg level between patients with all with or without leukopenia (57.71 fmol tg/μg dna [95% ci (- 22.93 to 138.35), p < 0.80]). dna-tg monitoring was found to be a promising method for predicting relapse rates in patients with all, and dna-tg levels are likely a better predictor for leukopenia in patients with ibd than rbc 6-tgns levels. dna-tg levels have been shown to correlate with various gene variants (tpmt, nudt15, itpa, and mrp4) in various studies, points to its potential as a more informative marker for guiding thiopurine therapy across diverse genetic backgrounds.
conclusions: this systematic review strongly supports the further investigation of dna-tg as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy. its correlation with treatment outcomes, such as relapse-free survival in all and the risk of leukopenia in ibd, underscores its role in enhancing personalized treatment approaches. dna-tg effectively identifies nudt15 variants and predicts late leukopenia in patients with ibd, regardless of their nudt15 variant status. the recommended threshold for late leukopenia prediction in patients with ibd with dna-tg is suggested to be between 320 and 340 fmol/μg dna. more clinical research on dna-tg implementation is mandatory to improve patient care and to improve inclusivity in thiopurine treatment.",Bayoumy AB; Ansari AR; Mulder CJJ; Schmiegelow K; Florin T; De Boer NKH,2024,Clinical pharmacokinetics,63,8,1089-1109,10.1007/s40262-024-01393-0,"Bayoumy, A.

39926204,a systematic review and meta-analysis: adverse inflammatory bowel disease outcomes following acute covid-19.,"background and aims: respiratory viral infections have been implicated in the exacerbation of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). to understand the impact of early sars-cov-2 variants on the risk of adverse ibd outcomes, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of high-quality studies.
methods: cohort studies investigating adverse ibd outcomes (ibd flares, change in disease activity, change in medication, ibd-related hospitalization, and surgery) following covid-19 were retrieved from medline and embase. the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies-of exposure tool was used to assess risk of bias. random effects model meta-analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (hr) for risk of adverse outcomes. subgroup analysis was performed to estimate risk of outcomes for ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease patients. metaregression was performed for sex and duration of follow-up.
results: of the 3119 identified studies, 5 were included in the meta-analysis. a total of 34,977 ibd patients with covid-19 and 53,270 ibd patients without recorded covid-19 infection were identified. two of the studies showed a high risk of bias. the random effects model did not show a statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse ibd outcomes following covid infection (hr:1.05 [0.75-1.46]). there was no significant difference in adverse outcomes between crohn's disease (hr: 0.91 [0.82-1.02]) and ulcerative colitis patients (hr: 0.83 [0.76-0.90]). neither the proportion of male participants nor the mean duration of follow-up were found to be significant predictors of effect size.
conclusion: in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we find that covid-19 did not increase the risk of adverse ibd outcomes.",Vitus ES; Mann S; Lees CW; Jess T; Elmahdi R,2025,Gastro hep advances,4,3,100581,10.1016/j.gastha.2024.10.021,"Vitus, E.

35355306,"effectiveness and safety of sars-cov-2 vaccine in inflammatory bowel disease patients: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression.","introduction: there are concerns regarding the effectiveness and safety of sars-cov-2 vaccine in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients. this systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively summarises the available literature regarding the safety and effectiveness of sars-cov-2 vaccine in ibd.
methods: three independent reviewers performed a comprehensive review of all original articles describing the response of sars-cov-2 vaccines in patients with ibd. primary outcomes were (1) pooled seroconversion rate sars-cov-2 vaccination in ibd patients (2) comparison of breakthrough covid-19 infection rate sars-cov-2 vaccination in ibd patients with control cohort and (3) pooled adverse event rate of sars-cov-2 vaccine. all outcomes were evaluated for one and two doses of sars-cov-2 vaccine. meta-regression was performed. probability of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and with egger's test.
results: twenty-one studies yielded a pooled seroconversion rate of 73.7% and 96.8% in ibd patients after one and two doses of sars-cov-2 vaccine respectively. sub-group analysis revealed non-statistically significant differences between different immunosuppressive regimens for seroconversion. meta-regression revealed that the vaccine type and study location independently influenced seroconversion rates. there was no statistically significant difference in breakthrough infection in ibd patients as compared to control after vaccination.
conclusion: in summary, the systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that sars-cov-2 vaccine is safe and effective in ibd patients.",Bhurwal A; Mutneja H; Bansal V; Goel A; Arora S; Attar B; Minacapelli CD; Kochhar G; Chen LA; Brant S; Seril D,2022,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,55,10,1244-1264,10.1111/apt.16913,"Bhurwal, A., Mutneja, H., Bansal, V., Goel, A., Arora, S., Attar, B., Minacapelli, C.
