However, ∼10-40% of HIV-1-infected individuals fail to achieve normalization of CD4+ T-cell counts despite persistent virological suppression. These patients are referred to as \"inadequate immunological responders,\" \"immunodiscordant responders,\" or \"immunological non-responders (INRs)\" who show severe immunological dysfunction. Indeed, INRs are at an increased risk of clinical progression to AIDS and non-AIDS events and present higher rates of mortality than HIV-1-infected individuals with adequate immune reconstitution. To date, the underlying mechanism of incomplete immune reconstitution in HIV-1-infected patients has not been fully elucidated.

In response to the first epidemic outbreak of HIV in injecting drug users and the second one by illegal commercial blood collection, China issued the Anti-Drug Law and launched the Blood Donation Act and nationwide nucleic acid testing, which has avoided 98,232 to 211,200 estimated infections and almost ended the blood product-related infection. China has been providing free antiretroviral therapy (ART) since 2003, which covered >80% of the identified patients and achieved a viral suppression rate of 91%. To bend the curve of increasing the disease burden of HIV and finally end the epidemic, China should consider constraining HIV spread through sexual transmission, narrowing the gaps in identifying HIV cases, and the long-term effectiveness and safety of ART in the future.", "Authors": "Xu JJ; Han MJ; Jiang YJ; Ding HB; Li X; Han XX; Lv F; Chen QF; Zhang ZN; Cui HL; Geng WQ; Zhang J; Wang Q; Kang J; Li XL; Sun H; Fu YJ; An MH; Hu QH; Chu ZX; Liu YJ; Shang H", "Year": "2021", "Journal": "Chinese medical journal", "Volume": "134", "Issue": "23", "Pages": "2799-2809", "DOI": "10.1097/CM9.0000000000001842", "citation_apa": "Xu, J.

The number of people living with HIV who do not know their serostatus has fallen worldwide. However, a number of existing obstacles stand in the way of better results. The socio-cultural context in Africa hampers knowledge and understanding of the disease, leading to stigmatizing attitudes, reluctance to undergo screening and poor access to treatment.Inequalities also exist within the countries of the North, as in the case of the French West Indies, which benefit from a policy to combat HIV/AIDS, with results that fall short of those in mainland France. For this reason, we have chosen to compare the situation in the West Indies with that in Benin, in the context of African culture.Our analysis takes stock of the issues and prospects linked to the accessibility and use of screening care in sub-Saharan Africa and the French Departments of America (DFA).In both cases, fear of the disease, stigmatization, fear of a positive HIV test result and fear of disclosing the test result limit preventive and treatment actions for an effective fight against HIV.In sub-Saharan Africa, women are more likely to accept a screening test than men. Certain populations, including adolescents and homosexuals, are in a vulnerable position. The comparison reveals similar attitudes and suggests actions or recommendations in both countries that have produced results.Innovative strategies and specific programs must be implemented to turn the tide in the fight against the HIV epidemic.", "Authors": "Kêdoté NM; Duguet AM; Agbahoungba JG; Gangbo FA", "Year": "2024", "Journal": "Journal international de bioethique et d'ethique des sciences", "Volume": "34", "Issue": "3", "Pages": "47-68", "DOI": "10.3917/jibes.343.0047", "citation_apa": "Kêdoté, N.

Despite the effort to contain the HIV/AIDS epidemic, LP has remained an impediment to individual immune reconstitution and public health.\nOBJECTIVE: This review aimed to estimate the prevalence and determine the factors associated with late presentation to HIV/AIDS care.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Wanfang, and Weipu database for articles published from 2010 to 2020. We utilized I2 statistics and Q-test to estimate heterogeneity between studies. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to calculate the aggregate odds ratio of late presentation to HIV/AIDS care.\nRESULTS: Of 9563 titles and abstracts retrieved, 189 were identified as potentially eligible and 39 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of late presentation to HIV/AIDS care was 43.26%. The major risk factors were patients ≥ 50 years old (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.85-2.58; I2 = 97.44%), married (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.35-1.68; I2 = 96.58%), with heterosexual contact as risk factor for infection (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.73-2.11; I2 = 90.74%) and diagnosed in medical institutions (OR = 2.35,95% CI: 2.11-2.62; I2 = 96.05%). In middle or low HIV prevalence areas, patients ≥ 50 years old (P = 0.01), married (P < 0.01) and diagnosed in medical institutions (P = 0.01) were more likely to be presented late than in high prevalence areas.

Its contribution to the HIV/AIDS burden in Ghana is still understudied. This study examined HIV/AIDS trends in Ghana before (1990-2004) and after (2004-2020) the implementation and expansion of ART.\nMETHODS: We obtained HIV/AIDS epidemiology and treatment data for the years 1990-2020 from the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. We investigated the impact of the ART rollout on HIV/AIDS in Ghana using Joinpoint regression models.\nRESULTS: The HIV incidence, prevalence, and AIDS-related deaths decreased significantly after 2004, as ART coverage increased from 1% to 2004 to 60% in 2020. The HIV incidence decreased by approximately 3% (AAPC = -2.6%; 95% CI: -3.2, -1.9) per year from 1990 to 2004 and approximately 5% (AAPC = -4.5%; 95% CI: -4.9, -4.2) per year from 2004 to 2020.

Recent improvement and standardization of criteria classifying tumor-induced MDSCs have led to unified descriptions and also promoted MDSC research in tuberculosis (TB) and AIDS. Despite convincing evidence on the induction of MDSCs by pathogen-derived molecules and inflammatory mediators in TB and AIDS, very little attention has been given to their therapeutic modulation or roles in vaccination in these diseases. Clinical manifestations in TB are consequences of complex host-pathogen interactions and are substantially affected by HIV infection.

Case study of the print press in Mozambique, 1986-2020.", "Abstract": "Mozambique has the sixth highest prevalence of HIV in the world and ranks fourth in new infections. The government-owned print press Notícias has played an important role in the social construction of HIV and AIDS in the country as it was entrusted with the role of disseminating HIV and AIDS information to the public since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country in 1986. Using Notícias' articles and frame analysis perspective, the article analyses the way Notícias has framed HIV and AIDS in the country since the late 1980s. The choice of media results from the fact that the way a phenomenon is constructed influences the way it is understood, as well as the way people may behave before it. The study found that Notícias' frames on HIV and AIDS have suffered from a threefold tension: the need to maintain the Frelimo government's former centralised and grassroots-orientated socialist ideology of health services in the context of the liberal market; the need to balance the influence of the global multilateral and bilateral actors and the Frelimo government's political interest of translating HIV and AIDS response to the Mozambican context; and the need to portray a nationalist and positive image of the government's performance in HIV and AIDS response before Mozambique's non-fully plausible societal practices for an effective HIV and AIDS response.

However, huge variability is observed across primary studies regarding the prevalence and determinants of neurocognitive impairment in people with HIV/AIDS. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to determine the pooled prevalence of neurocognitive impairment and identify factors contributing to variations in its estimate among people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search of scientific databases (Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) was performed from inception onward. Google and Google Scholar were also searched for grey literature. Research articles available until July 15, 2022 were included. We used STATA-version 14 statistical software for analysis. A random effect model was executed to pool the reported prevalence of neurocognitive impairments. Subgroup analysis was done to show variations in the prevalence of neurocognitive impairments and factors that might contribute to these variations.\nRESULTS: A literature search resulted in 8,047 articles. After the removal of duplications and thorough evaluation, a total of 49 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments was highly variable across studies, ranging from 14% to 88%, yielding the pooled prevalence of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairment to be 46.34% [95% CI (40.32, 52.36)] and I2 = 98.5% with a P-value of 0.001.\nCONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa have HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairment. This illustrates the need to establish practical approaches to early identification and effective control of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments.

Since that time and over the following 30 years, World Workshops on oral HIV have been held every four years or so. The aims of the first and all subsequent Workshops were to bring together clinicians and non-clinical scientists who have an interest in the oral manifestations of HIV disease, to share worldwide perspectives, knowledge and understanding of oral health and disease in HIV infection, to agree on global definitions and classifications of oral diseases and to identify research needs taking account of the worldwide perspectives and opportunities. Thus, there have been clinical science, social science and basic science aspects of each World Workshop. The Workshops have achieved their aims and have had impact in all three fields, leading to robust research agendas, changes in national HIV policies and international collaborations. They have led to policy declarations of access to oral care as a basic human right for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals and advancing the rights of all HIV-positive healthcare workers to perform clinical practice.", "Authors": "Greenspan JS; Challacombe SJ", "Year": "2020", "Journal": "Oral diseases", "Volume": "26 Suppl 1", "Issue": "", "Pages": "3-8", "DOI": "10.1111/odi.13385", "citation_apa": "Greenspan, J.

{"PMID": "40641200", "Title": "Bridging Palliative Care and HIV/AIDS: A Call for Integrated Approaches.", "Abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) remain significant global health challenges. Beyond the physical manifestations, individuals living with HIV/AIDS often grapple with psychological burdens, notably anxiety, which can adversely affect their quality of life (QoL) and physiological stress markers, such as cortisol levels. Palliative care, traditionally associated with end-of-life support, has evolved to address the multifaceted needs of chronic illness patients, including those with HIV/AIDS. In the world, 1.89 million individuals require palliative care due to pain, and around 2.7 million people have HIV. This editorial explores the role of palliative care in enhancing QoL and modulating cortisol levels among HIV/AIDS patients experiencing anxiety. Palliative care is holistic, addressing physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. In the context of HIV/AIDS, palliative interventions have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating symptoms, reducing psychological distress, and improving overall well-being. A systematic review highlighted that home-based palliative care and inpatient hospice services significantly improved patient outcomes in pain management, symptom control, anxiety reduction, and spiritual well-being. Palliative care emerges as a vital component in the comprehensive management of HIV/AIDS, particularly for patients grappling with anxiety. By enhancing quality of life and potentially modulating stress-induced hormonal imbalances, palliative interventions offer a holistic approach that addresses both psychological and physiological aspects of the disease. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which palliative care influences cortisol levels and exploring its long-term benefits on disease progression and patient well-being.", "Authors": "Putranto R", "Year": "2025", "Journal": "Acta medica Indonesiana", "Volume": "57", "Issue": "2", "Pages": "151-152", "DOI": "", "citation_apa": "Putranto, R.

{"PMID": "40755211", "Title": "The HIV/AIDS pandemic: where are we now?", "Abstract": "The global HIV/AIDS response is facing its most serious crisis in decades. Despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the growing availability of prevention tools such as oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and long-acting PrEP, progress toward the UNAIDS 2025 targets has stalled. HIV incidence remains unacceptably high across key populations and geographic regions, while treatment coverage gaps and preventable deaths persist. The abrupt 2025 suspension of U.S. foreign aid programs, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has further disrupted service delivery, particularly for prevention programs and marginalized groups. This editorial assesses the underlying structural, political, and programmatic failures that led to missed targets and highlights the compounded risks posed by policy reversals. Drawing on recent epidemiological data and modeling, we estimate the impact of prevention gaps, disparities in access, and policy changes on global HIV trajectories. We argue that a path forward requires reforms, renewed political will, and sustainable financing. In a moment of rising global polarization and shrinking public health budgets, the HIV response must be reimagined around equity, inclusion, and collective action. Without such recalibration, the vision of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will remain out of reach.", "Authors": "Beyrer C; Ratevosian J; Gelderblom H; Rosenberg NE", "Year": "2025", "Journal": "AIDS (London, England)", "Volume": "39", "Issue": "11", "Pages": "1497-1504", "DOI": "10.1097/QAD.0000000000004308", "citation_apa": "Beyrer, C., Ratevosian, J., Gelderblom, H., & Rosenberg, N.

{"PMID": "35069778", "Title": "HIV/AIDS-Pneumonia Codynamics Model Analysis with Vaccination and Treatment.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we proposed and analyzed a realistic compartmental mathematical model on the spread and control of HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic incorporating pneumonia vaccination and treatment for both infections at each infection stage in a population. The model exhibits six equilibriums: HIV/AIDS only disease-free, pneumonia only disease-free, HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic disease-free, HIV/AIDS only endemic, pneumonia only endemic, and HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic endemic equilibriums. The HIV/AIDS only submodel has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if R 1 < 1. Using center manifold theory, we have verified that both the pneumonia only submodel and the HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic model undergo backward bifurcations whenever R 2 < 1 and R 3 = max{R 1, R 2} < 1, respectively. Thus, for pneumonia infection and HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coinfection, the requirement of the basic reproduction numbers to be less than one, even though necessary, may not be sufficient to completely eliminate the disease. Our sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the pneumonia disease transmission rate β 2 and the HIV/AIDS transmission rate β 1 play an important role to change the qualitative dynamics of HIV/AIDS and pneumonia coinfection. The pneumonia infection transmission rate β 2 gives rises to the possibility of backward bifurcation for HIV/AIDS and pneumonia coinfection if R 3 = max{R 1, R 2} < 1, and hence, the existence of multiple endemic equilibria some of which are stable and others are unstable. Using standard data from different literatures, our results show that the complete HIV/AIDS and pneumonia coinfection model reproduction number is R 3 = max{R 1, R 2} = max{1.386, 9.69 } = 9.69 at β 1 = 2 and β 2 = 0.2 which shows that the disease spreads throughout the community.

In the project, three measures are implemented, such as great improvements of the coverage of HIV/AIDS education, promotion of HIV voluntary counseling and testing, and enhancement of antiretroviral treatment. In this paper, we explore the effects of the three measures of GACP by construction of a Susceptible-Infected-Diagnosed-Treated population compartments model and via evaluation of the basic reproduction number derived from the model. A computational framework is developed for estimating the model parameters based on the HIV surveillance data, with application of the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method and Nonlinear Least Squares method. By estimating the new infections and evaluating the basic reproduction number, we find that the implementation of the three measures of GACP has a significant effect on controlling the rise of HIV/AIDS cases and the epidemic trend. Compared with HIV voluntary counseling and testing, strengthening HIV/AIDS education and expanding the coverage of antiretroviral treatment show a greater impact on HIV/AIDS epidemic control, which provides a reference project for other provinces with a similar epidemic situation in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

{"PMID": "38117745", "Title": "Beyond the discourses of policy and power: HIV, AIDS, and community perspectives on the lived pandemic.", "Abstract": "As HIV unfolded in the 1980s, HIV and AIDS were heard and seen through the lives of those whom it touched directly. Personal histories were foregrounded, centred by the inevitable mortality attached to HIV infection, the courage of circumstance in the face of illness, and the activism necessary to make a difference. In the later part of the decade, the impacts of HIV were most apparent in East Africa, where community responses and political leadership coalesced to reduce new HIV infections. The 1990s marked a turn towards centralised policy, funding, and the reification of biomedically oriented approaches and systems that are intrinsically top-down. This biomedical turn centred on foregrounding the widespread availability of low-cost antiretroviral therapy and was articulated in the 90-90-90 and subsequent targets. Biomedicalisation reinforces individualised approaches to health primarily focused on biomedical technologies and health service provision that do not rely on community or social organisation formats. Emphasis on HIV treatment, along with the promise of reduced HIV transmission through viral load suppression, contributed to limiting socio-behavioural approaches to HIV prevention. While the importance of community-led response was highlighted in the 2016 United Nations Political Declaration on Ending AIDS, community-led response has devolved towards concepts such as community-led monitoring and community-led response that frame responses in direct relation to the dominant biomedical paradigm. There are lessons in the history of the AIDS response that demonstrate that communities formulate responses to AIDS differently when there have been opportunities for community members to determine the pathways for action to address HIV independently. Older research studies offer retrospective insights into moments in the history of HIV when communities were foregrounded and highlighted the need to reconsider the current trajectory of the HIV response. Not only for history's sake but to acknowledge that community leadership remains overwhelmed by elites. While lofty targets and goals drive the contemporary HIV response, the way forward is mired by uncertainty. HIV prevention efforts remain uneven, and millions of people living with HIV depend on access to treatment for decades to come in the context of budgetary uncertainties.

The drive to 'end AIDS' has become a global flagship endeavour, including nation-states, donor organisations, NGOs, pharmaceutical companies, medical researchers, and activists. Almost synonymous with the campaign of ending AIDS is UNAIDS' 90-90-90 targets. Beyond indicators' role in neoliberal global health, an essential aspect of indicators and quantitative metrics is their ability to provide a basis for measurements and comparability across time and between different actors and entities. These processes are based on what has been called, commensuration, visual simplification, and serialisation. This article seeks to provide an account of how we can think about indicators in the drive to end AIDS as doing work that is contingent upon commensuration, simplification, and serialisation. The argument is that by attending to issues of commensuration, visual simplification, and serialisation we are better able to see how we risk erasing and foreclosing other forms of conceptualising what the end of AIDS could be.

Patients were randomly divided into a training group and test group at a ratio of 2.75:1. Features from all lesions, cavity lesions and solid nodule lesions were extracted, and two kinds of radiomic models (6 types) were established. ROC curves were drawn, and the sensitivity and specificity were calculated to compare the SVM model and LR model, radiologists' empirical diagnoses and the combination of these empirical diagnoses with the radiomic model.\nRESULTS: The AUCs of senior radiologist for all lesions and cavity lesions were lower than those of the SVM and LR models. The diagnostic efficacy of primary radiologist was lower than that of both of the other model types. The diagnostic efficacy of the LR model was relatively stable, with the highest diagnostic efficiency of the 3 model/radiologist groups.

The median CD4 count of AIDS patients was 11 cells/μL (range: 1-198), and 33% had concurrent opportunistic infections. 63.6% of 118 non-AIDS patients received immunosuppressive medications, 28.8% had comorbidities, and 7.6% had no coexisting conditions. Disseminated nocardiosis and pleural effusion were more prevalent among AIDS patients, whereas non-AIDS patients revealed more shock and respiratory failure. One hundred-fifty patients underwent brain imaging; 15 (10%) had brain abscesses. Patients with pulmonary nocardiosis have overall 30-day and 1-year mortality rates of 38.5% (95% CI: 32.3%, 45.4%) and 52.1% (95% CI: 45.6%, 58.9%), respectively. The Cox survival analysis showed that AIDS patients with disseminated nocardiosis had a 7.93-fold (95% CI: 2.61-24.02, p < 0.001) increased risk of death within 30 days compared to non-AIDS patients when considering variables such as age, Charlson comorbidity index, concurrent opportunistic infections, duration of illness, shock, respiratory failure, multi-lobar pneumonia, lung abscesses, and combination antibiotic therapy.

From the beginning of the epidemic until 2020, about 79.3 million people became infected, with 36.3 million deaths due to AIDS illnesses. This huge figure is a result of those unaware of their status due to stigmatization and invariably spreading the virus unknowingly. Methods: Qualitative analysis through a mathematical model that will address HIV unaware individuals and the effect of an increasing defaulter on the dynamics of HIV/AIDS was investigated. The impact of treatment and the effect of inefficient follow-up on the transmission of HIV/AIDS were examined. The threshold for the effective reduction of the unaware status of HIV through testing, in response to awareness, and the significance of effective non-defaulting in treatment commonly called defaulters loss to follow-up as these individuals contribute immensely to the spread of the virus due to their increase in CD4+ count was determined in this study. Stability analysis of equilibrium points is performed using the basic reproduction number $R_0$, an epidemiological threshold that determines disease eradication or persistence in viral populations. We tested the most sensitive parameters in the basic reproduction numbers. Results: The results portray that early identification and treatment only are inadequate for the illness to be eradicated, but effectively used of condom, strict adherence to treatment and counseling of and testing of pregnant women contribute to a decrease in infected HIV individuals. Conclusions: Other control techniques, such as treatment adherence and effective condom usage, and reduction in vertical transmission cannot be over-emphasis to lessen the disease's burden.

This study compared deaths from HIV/AIDS with smoking-attributable deaths among California gay and bisexual men from 2005 to 2050.\nMETHODS: Smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) were estimated using smoking prevalence for gay and bisexual men from the 2011-2014 California Health Interview Surveys and published relative risks of death. Smoking-attributable deaths were calculated by multiplying the SAFs by deaths among gay and bisexual men. Deaths from HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men was obtained from the California Department of Public Health. Future deaths from smoking and HIV/AIDS were projected using regression equations based on time trends.\nRESULTS: From 2005 to 2014, smoking caused over 6800 deaths among gay and bisexual men, while nearly 9500 died from HIV/AIDS. Mortality from both causes has been falling, but deaths from HIV/AIDS have been falling more rapidly. Projections suggest that in the mid-2040s, more gay/bisexual men will die from smoking than from HIV/AIDS.\nCONCLUSION: Smoking will surpass HIV/AIDS as a cause of death among gay and bisexual men in California within a few decades.

However, few studies have explored the psychosocial mechanisms influencing self-management behaviors among PLWHA in China. This study, conducted in accordance with STROBE guidelines, uses SEM to explore the roles of social support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in predicting self-management behaviors among Chinese PLWHA.\nMETHODS: From March 2023 to July 2023, a convenience sample of 282 PLWHA, recruited from one designated AIDS hospital and one Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Sichuan Province, China, was surveyed. Data were collected via four validated self-report scales (the Social Support Rating Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Self-Esteem Scale, and the HIV/AIDS Patient Self-Management Scale). Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relationships among social support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and self-management behaviors.\nRESULTS: The new model demonstrated acceptable fit parameters (χ2/df = 2.15, GFI = 0.96, AGFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.93, IFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.05). The direct effect of social support on self-management behaviors was significant (β = 0.117, P < 0.05). In addition, self-efficacy and self-esteem played significant mediating roles in the influence of social support on self-management behaviors, accounting for 38.73% and 22.79% of the total effect, respectively. Moreover, they served as chain mediators, contributing 9.80% to the total effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychosocial dynamics influencing self-management behavior in Chinese PLWHA and have broader implications for populations in other countries.

The negative impact of depressive disorders on HIV/AIDS is well known, including on treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, depressive disorders are underdiagnosed and undertreated in seropositive persons. This review summarizes clinically useful information on depressive disorders in HIV/AIDS. More specifically, we address assessment, differential diagnosis, contributing factors, management, and common challenges in the treatment of depressive disorders in seropositive individuals. Assessment and diagnosis of depression may be challenging in seropositive persons because of several biopsychosocial particularities associated with HIV/AIDS. One of the difficulties is the overlap between depression and HIV/AIDS symptoms, particularly in individuals with advanced AIDS, requiring consideration of a broad differential diagnosis. Several factors related to HIV/AIDS status contribute to the higher rates of depressive disorders, including infectious-immunological, psychosocial, and exogenous factors. The treatment of depressive disorders in HIV/AIDS involves three groups of interventions: (1) pharmacological interventions, (2) psychotherapeutic interventions, and (3) management of other contributing factors. Challenges in management include poor adherence to treatment and the risk of suicide.

Malignancies previously associated with HIV/AIDS, also known as the AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) have been documented to decrease, while the non-AIDS defining cancer (NADCs) are on the rise. On the other hand, cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and precision oncology as the most effective cancer therapy is gaining attraction. Among HIV-infected individuals, the increased risk for developing cancer is due to the immune system of the patient being suppressed, frequent coinfection with oncogenic viruses and an increase in risky behavior such as poor lifestyle. The core of personalised medicine for cancer depends on the discovery and the development of biomarkers. Biomarkers are specific and highly sensitive markers that reveal information that aid in leading to the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of the disease.

Cross-national indicators can be critical tools in international governance-building social power to monitor state behaviour with the potential to change policy and improve domestic accountability.

Alignment between national policy environments and global norms is demonstrated through comparison with international public health guidance and agreements. We demonstrate substantial variation in the content of law and policies between countries, regions and policy areas. Given progress in basic and implementation science, it would be tempting to believe most countries have adopted policies aligned with global norms, with a few outliers. Data show this is not the case. Globally, alignment is higher on clinical and treatment policies than on prevention, testing and structural policies.

{"PMID": "36446878", "Title": "Incorporating social determinants of health into the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS.", "Abstract": "Currently, it is estimated that 37.6 million people are living with the HIV/AIDS virus worldwide, placing HIV/AIDS among the ten leading causes of death, mostly among low- and lower-middle-income countries. Despite the effective intervention in the prevention and treatment, this reduction did not occur equally among populations, subpopulations and geographic regions. This difference in the occurrence of the disease is associated with the social determinants of health (SDH), which could affect the transmission and maintenance of HIV. With the recognition of the importance of SDH in HIV transmission, the development of mathematical models that incorporate these determinants could increase the accuracy and robustness of the modeling. This article aims to propose a theoretical and conceptual way of including SDH in the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS. The theoretical mathematical model with the Social Determinants of Health has been developed in stages. For the selection of SDH that were incorporated into the model, a narrative literature review was conducted. Secondly, we proposed an extended model in which the population (N) is divided into Susceptible (S), HIV-positive (I), Individual with AIDS (A) and individual under treatment (T). Each SDH had a different approach to embedding in the model. We performed a calibration and validation of the model. A total of 31 SDH were obtained in the review, divided into four groups: Individual Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Social Participation, and Health Services. In the end, four determinants were selected for incorporation into the model: Education, Poverty, Use of Drugs and Alcohol abuse, and Condoms Use. the section \"Numerical simulation\" to simulate the influence of the poverty rate on the AIDS incidence and mortality rates. We used a Brazilian dataset of new AIDS cases and deaths, which is publicly available. We calibrated the model using a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the years 2003 to 2019. To forecast from 2020 to 2035, we assumed two lines of poverty rate representing (i) a scenario of increasing and (ii) a scenario of decreasing. To avoid overfitting, we fixed some parameters and estimated the remaining. The equations presented with the chosen SDH exemplify some approaches that we can adopt when thinking about modeling social effects on the occurrence of HIV. The model was able to capture the influence of the employment/poverty on the HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates, evidencing the importance of SDOH in the occurrence of diseases. The recognition of the importance of including the SDH in the modeling and studies on HIV/AIDS is evident, due to its complexity and multicausality. Models that do not take into account in their structure, will probably miss a great part of the real trends, especially in periods, as the current on, of economic crisis and strong socioeconomic changes.", "Authors": "de Oliveira RB; Rubio FA; Anderle R; Sanchez M; de Souza LE; Macinko J; Dourado I; Rasella D", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Scientific reports", "Volume": "12", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "20541", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-022-24459-0", "citation_apa": "de Oliveira, R.

However, there is currently no systematic review addressing the occurrence and impact of social isolation in individuals with HIV. Therefore, this study undertook a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to examine the prevalence and influencing factors associated with social isolation among PLWH.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, China Science and Technology Journal Database, The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database will be searched from the establishment of the database to the latest search date.

With the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Taiwan in 1997, the incidences of HIV-related opportunistic illnesses and mortality have significantly declined. However, despite improved access to HIV testing and treatment, late presentation of HIV infection remains common. Unprotected sex, particularly among men who have sex with men, continues to be the leading risk for HIV transmission after implementation of harm reduction program to control an outbreak of HIV infection among people who inject drugs that occurred in 2003-2007. The sequential introduction of well-tolerated, effective, single-tablet antiretroviral regimens has facilitated the implementation of \"treat-all\" policy in 2016, rapid ART initiation within 7 days of diagnosis in 2018, and same-day ART initiation in 2021 when immunochromatography was used for rapid confirmation of HIV infection. Government-funded pilot program of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection, which was launched in 2016 followed by wider enrollment of people at high risk for HIV acquisition in 2018, have contributed to sustained declines of the incidence of HIV infection since 2018, along with high rates of linkage to HIV care, ART initiation, viral suppression, and retention in care in Taiwan.

The epidemic first became evident in the community of men with male sexual partners (MSM), and subsequently spread to intravenous drug users (IVDU), female commercial sex workers (CSW) and their male clients, and, ultimately, to their partners and children. The HIV epidemic has devastated the country's working-age population. The extensive negative impact and social stigma associated with the disease do not only have an impact on the victims of HIV but also on their descendants and relatives. An epicenter of the HIV epidemic has been in the northern provinces of Thailand. An HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE, a complex chimeric virus composed of both A and E subtypes, is prevalent in Northern Thailand. The virus has quickly become a predominant viral strain circulating in Thailand, other neighboring Southeast Asian countries, and China as well as some other countries throughout the world. The epidemiology, evolution, and biology of CRF01_AE offer a unique model for further scientific investigations which would advance the knowledge of and curative strategies against HIV. In addition, Thailand has developed suitable national guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention in order to control the epidemic. Effective antiretroviral drugs are, therefore, able to be made available to those who live with HIV. The national surveillance system has also been effective. The great efforts and resources which Thailand has dedicated to the fight against the epidemic have eventually paid off. In 2010, a plan was proposed to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission and Thailand has become the first country to be effective in this objective. Thailand therefore has become recognized as being the global leader in HIV prevention and treatment.

Due to the advantages in promoting patients' immune reconstitution, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has become one of the mainstays of complementary treatments for HIV/AIDS-INRs. Given that effective TCM treatments largely depend on precise syndrome differentiation, there is an increasing interest in exploring biological evidence for the classification of TCM syndromes in HIV/AIDS-INRs. In our study, to identify the typical HIV/AIDS-INRs syndrome, an epidemiological survey was first conducted in the Liangshan prefecture (China), a high HIV/AIDS prevalence region. The key TCM syndrome, Yang deficiency of spleen and kidney (YDSK), was evaluated by using a tandem mass tag combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (TMT-LC-MS/MS). A total of 62 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of YDSK syndrome compared with healthy people were screened out. Comparative bioinformatics analyses showed that DEPs in YDSK syndrome were mainly associated with response to wounding and acute inflammatory response in the biological process. The pathway annotation is mainly enriched in complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, the YDSK syndrome-specific DEPs such as HP and S100A9 were verified by ELISA, and confirmed as potential biomarkers for YDSK syndrome. Our study may lay the biological and scientific basis for the specificity of TCM syndromes in HIV/AIDs-INRs, and may provide more opportunities for the deep understanding of TCM syndromes and the developing more effective and stable TCM treatment for HIV/AIDS-INRs.", "Authors": "Ji SX; Zheng YF; Li X; Li BX; Zou JX; Wang YT; Xia XY; Chen X; Hu QN; Wan TJ; Wen L; Feng QS", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "Volume": "306", "Issue": "12", "Pages": "3106-3119", "DOI": "10.1002/ar.25018", "citation_apa": "Ji, S.

Impactful interventions on HIV/AIDS for older persons require knowledge on effects of the pandemic on this population. A study was undertaken to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of HIV/AIDS, as well as health literacy (HL) level of a population aged ≥ 50 years.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at three sites in South Africa and two sites in Lesotho with an educational intervention at the South African sites. At baseline, data were collected for assessment of KAP of HIV/AIDS and HL levels. The pre- and post-intervention comprised participants at South African sites being familiarised with the contents of a specially constructed HIV/AIDS educational booklet. Participants' KAP was reassessed six weeks later. A composite score of ≥ 75% was considered adequate KAP and an adequate HL level.\nRESULTS: The baseline survey comprised 1163 participants. The median age was 63 years (range 50-98 years); 70% were female, and 69% had ≤ 8 years' education. HL was inadequate in 56% and the KAP score was inadequate in 64%.

HIV infection shortens life expectancy to about 5 to 10 years compared to noninfected individuals. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are prone to several health challenges as a result of a deranged immune system culminating in high morbidity and mortality. Depression is a common feature of PLWHA. Depression heightens the emergence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected individuals, accelerates the progression to AIDS, and increased suicidal tendencies, morbidity, and mortality. Food insecurity with its resultant undernutrition contributes to HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Undernourished PLWHA are more prone to opportunistic infections due to poor immunity. Interestingly, proper diet intake can boost immunity, slow the progression of AIDS and opportunistic infections, enhance body weight, and retard depression tendencies. Undernutrition can also be ameliorated by incorporating nutritional counseling and oral nutrient supplementation in routine HIV/AIDS checkups. Therefore, to increase HIV/AIDS management outcomes, the integration of nutrition counseling, dietary supplements, and mental health services should be embraced. Thus, HIV/AIDS care centers should amplify these services. In this article, we isolated relevant studies from various databases, illuminated the interwoven relationship between HIV/AIDS, depression, and undernutrition, and also reemphasized the need for adequate nutritional intervention in the battle against HIV/AIDS.

Data from four GCC countries, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and UAE, indicated that by 2021, 94%, 80%, 66%, and 85% of HIV-positive population knew their status, respectively. 68%, 93% (2020 data), 65%, 58% and 85% of PLHIV in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and UAE who knew their status were on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), respectively, and 55%, 92%, 58% and 90% (2020 data) among those who were on ART had viral suppression in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and KSA, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The GCC countries have made great strides toward fulfilling the 95-95-95 targets, but the interim 2025 overall UNAIDS targets remain unmet. The GCC countries must strive diligently to accomplish the targets by emphasising early identification of the cases by enhanced screening and testing, as well as prompt commencement of ART therapy with viral load suppression.", "Authors": "Awaidy SA; Ghazy RM; Mahomed O", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "Journal of epidemiology and global health", "Volume": "13", "Issue": "3", "Pages": "397-406", "DOI": "10.1007/s44197-023-00097-1", "citation_apa": "Awaidy, S.

Despite the increased advocacy and dissemination of comprehensive HIV/AIDS information in SSA, it appears that little progress has been made to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the sub-region. This study, therefore, examined the association between comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge and safer sex negotiation among adolescent girls and young women in SSA. Data were taken from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2010 and 2019 in 30 countries in SSA. The study sample comprised 37,364 adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24. A multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was done to test the hypothesis that there is a positive association between comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge and safer sex negotiation. Adolescent girls and young women who had comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS were more likely to negotiate for safer sex compared with those who had no comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS (AOR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.22-1.41). At the country level, the positive association between comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS and safer sex negotiation was significant in Chad, Congo DR, Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Ethiopia and Malawi. On the other hand, in Togo, adolescent girls and young women who had comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge were less likely to negotiate for safer sex. These findings can inform policies and programmes on the crucial role of comprehensive HIV/AIDS education and knowledge in increasing safer sex negotiation among adolescent girls and young women in SSA. The study recommends that Togo needs to address certain practices such as intimate partner violence against adolescent girls and young women, which prevent them from negotiating for safer sex, despite their higher knowledge on comprehensive HIV/AIDS. Lessons can be learnt from Chad, Congo DR, Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Ethiopia and Malawi about the scale-up of programmes and interventions targeted at young women.", "Authors": "Frimpong JB; Budu E; Adu C; Mohammed A; Tetteh JK; Seidu AA; Ahinkorah BO", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Journal of biosocial science", "Volume": "54", "Issue": "6", "Pages": "991-1003", "DOI": "10.1017/S0021932021000493", "citation_apa": "Frimpong, J.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related KS (AIDS-related KS; n = 95) and classic KS (CKS; n = 81) diagnosed at a tertiary center between 2000 and 2014 in Lima, Peru. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival (OS) rates. The median follow-up was 64 months for AIDS-related KS and 88 months for CKS. The median age of patients with AIDS-related KS was 35 years (range 20-63 years) and 70 years (range 33-91 years) for those with CKS. Most individuals had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≥ 2 (AIDS-related KS 75%; CKS 85%).

While all countries have been impacted by HIV, some have been significantly more impacted than others, particularly countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this paper was to identify progress made in HIV prevention globally, particularly in the areas of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) uptake, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV-related stigma. With the development of ART, a cocktail of medications for the treatment of HIV, VCT uptake increased, as it became apparent that the medication would only be prescribed after an HIV diagnosis through testing. Widely considered a critical gateway to HIV prevention and treatment, VCT is being implemented in many countries, and as a result, about 38 million people living with HIV in 2018 had access to ART. Regardless of this success, major challenges still remain. We did an electronic search of 135 articles in English related to global HIV progress and challenges indexed in PubMed, ResearchGate, Google, and other search engines from 1998 to 2021. Sixty articles met the inclusion criteria for this paper. Data on trends in ART coverage were obtained from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) website. These data were used to show ART coverage globally in World Health Organization (WHO) regions. It was found that while global successes have been chalked in the areas of VCT uptake and ART coverage, HIV-related stigma has impeded greater success. This paper summarizes and discusses global successes and challenges in HIV prevention efforts in the past four decades with a focus on VCT, ART, and HIV-related stigma.", "Authors": "Armstrong-Mensah EA; Tetteh AK; Ofori E; Ekhosuehi O", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "Volume": "19", "Issue": "11", "Pages": "", "DOI": "10.3390/ijerph19116597", "citation_apa": "Armstrong-Mensah, E.

{"PMID": "36283150", "Title": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in anti-CD20 and other monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies used in multiple sclerosis: A review.", "Abstract": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a subacute CNS inflammatory disease seen primarily among immunocompromised patients. It is caused by the JC virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that otherwise induces an insidious, latent infection in the general population. This reactivated disease is characterized by cognitive and behavioral changes, language disturbances, motor weakness, or visual deficits. Median survival in patients with AIDS is approximately 2-4 months, and mortality is high (around 4% in untreated AIDS). Recent scientific developments indicate that PML can also be associated with the increased utilization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapy. In fact, PML has been witnessed with several mAbs, including natalizumab in multiple sclerosis, rituximab for lymphoma or lupus, efalizumab for psoriasis, and ofatumumab in leukemia; this leads us to the risk reassessment of PML due to treatment-induced immunosuppression. The range of clinical presentations of JCV-related disease has transformed over time and can pose significant challenges to the current diagnostic criteria. Most cases with PML suffer from persistent and irreversible neurological conditions, and some with chronic, low-level viral replication in the CNS. With the expanded use of mAbs for various autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders, we are now seeing this infection in non-HIV patients on drugs such as natalizumab, rituximab, and other recently approved therapies. This article aims to review the relationship between the incidence of PML and all four mAbs used in the treatment of MS. Currently, at least 18 FDA-approved medications carry label warnings for PML;to this date, no treatment has been convincingly effective.", "Authors": "Sharma K; Tolaymat S; Yu H; Elkhooly M; Jaiswal S; Jena A; Kakara M; Sriwastava S", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Journal of the neurological sciences", "Volume": "443", "Issue": "", "Pages": "120459", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jns.2022.120459", "citation_apa": "Sharma, K., Tolaymat, S., Yu, H., Elkhooly, M., Jaiswal, S., Jena, A., Kakara, M., & Sriwastava, S.

The latest edition (the 2021 version) has recently been updated in China in accordance with clinical practice nationwide and results of the latest research. Compared to the four previous editions, the 2021 edition references the latest information on the epidemiology of HIV, the prevention of HIV transmission, standardized lab diagnosis, and clinical management. First, the guidelines highlight the concept of \"enhancing the combination of early intervention, prevention, and treatment\". The guidelines specify more detailed clinical phases (three clinical stages), the clinical staging and progression of AIDS, and patient prognosis. The guidelines also specify diagnostic criteria - HIV antibodies, HIV RNA tests, CD4 cell counts, and the patient's epidemiological history - to use in conjunction with symptoms to confirm an HIV infection. In addition, the guidelines summarize more advanced HIV/AIDS research in China by describing the different circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) in Chinese patients, by summarizing the most prevalent strains in the Chinese population, and by comparing disease progression by route of transmission and by the CD4+T cell count. Lastly, this edition describes ways to optimize programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission, strategies for diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections, the aging patient population, and specialized ART treatment programs for different populations living with HIV. The guidelines should not only help to prolong the life of people living with HIV and improve their quality of life but also encourage successful collaboration between scientific researchers and physicians in the area of HIV.", "Authors": "He Y; Lu H", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Bioscience trends", "Volume": "15", "Issue": "6", "Pages": "413-417", "DOI": "10.5582/bst.2021.01514", "citation_apa": "He, Y., & Lu, H.

This paper was written to effectively translate HIV/AIDS knowledge into actionable behavioral changes among secondary school students in Uganda by empowering them with comprehensive information, fostering a deeper understanding of preventive measures, and facilitating the development of responsible and informed decision-making skills, thereby reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS transmission within this demographic. There is a relationship between risk perception and behavior change in HIV/AIDS prevention among high school students. This can be explained by the high proportion of secondary school students who think they are at risk of HIV infection; this perception may be related to having had early sex, being sexually active, and knowing someone has died of HIV. High school students regularly engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms and having multiple lifelong partners.

Five questionnaires were used: AIDS risk perception, self-efficacy in controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS, controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the family assessment device.\nRESULTS: The results demonstrated that all two models enjoyed acceptable fitness, and the mediating roles of self-efficacy and AIDS risk perception were confirmed. Moreover, family functioning and perceived social support together could predict 20% of the variance of controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS. The results also indicated that family functioning with a standardized coefficient of - 0.24 and self-efficacy in controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS with a standardized coefficient of 0.58 could predict the controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS (p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that self-efficacy and AIDS risk perception play major roles in controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS.

A cross-sectional study utilized pre-treatment blood samples collected between 2020 and 2021 from the biorepository in May 2024. Partial pol gene sequences were obtained through plasma collection and RNA extraction. Drug resistance analysis was performed using the Stanford University HIVdb algorithm. Molecular network were constructed using Cytoscape 3.10.0. Spatial analysis and visualization were further conducted using ArcGIS10.8.1. 95 sequences were obtained, among which 7 HIV-1 genotypes were detected and CRF07_BC (67.37%, 64/95) was the predominant one. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were detected in 13.68%(13/95) of the sequences. The risk of PDR occurrence was higher among individuals with CRF07_BC strain types. The 24 sequences of CRF07_BC, CRF01_AE, and URF subtypes grouped into nine transmission clusters in the molecular network, with CRF07_BC showing the highest integration and clustering rates. HIV-1 infections resistant to PDR were observed in all five cities in NHAR, accompanied by cross-city transmission.

Studies identified cases of HIV infection among FSWs in all but one province during this time period, and demonstrated a sporadic pattern in most provinces, with a low overall national HIV prevalence below 1%. However, in Yunnan and Guanxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions, the median-reported prevalence rates were close to or slightly above 1%. National prevention programs have widely promoted male condoms as a primary and practical measure for HIV prevention, but studies evaluating condom use practices among FSWs demonstrated wide variability. A rise in illicit use of synthetic drugs and changing sexual practices in the setting of sex work (e.g., anal sex) may represent newer risk factors for HIV transmission among FSWs; however, more data are needed to better characterize these trends. Limited studies have examined the feasibility and efficacy of innovative prevention tools (e.g., female condoms) or strategies (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) to prevent HIV among FSWs.

We had a six times greater proportion of children living with HIV. The mean number of HIV-exposed babies rose annually from 26 (1985-87) to 37 (1988-90). Our first team of caregivers comprised a nurse practitioner, a social worker, and me. We were, in time, joined by a growing number of colleagues. Enlightened and generous hospital administrators provided us with outpatient space and the promise of continued funding to support additional staff and in 1987, an independent Pediatric AIDS Care Program. We implemented the proven MTCT prevention guidelines articulated in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocol 076 and by 1995, the MTCT rate at YNHH fell to 9 percent. Since 1996, the MTCT rate at YNHH has been zero percent. Combination antiretroviral therapy, cART, made its debut in the mid-1990s; five classes of drugs with multiple agents in each were licensed between 2003 and 2013. We designed individual treatment plans for each child and gradually entered an era when our clinic was populated with healthier long-term survivors.

{"PMID": "37698802", "Title": "Medical mistrust as a barrier to HIV prevention and care.", "Abstract": "Medical mistrust is fueled by conspiracy theories and histories of healthcare systems abuse and is a known determinant of health outcomes in minority populations. Plagued by multiple and pervasive conspiracy theories, HIV/AIDS has proven to be particularly hampered by medical mistrust. The current paper systematically reviews the literature on medical mistrust among people at risk for or living with HIV infection. The bulk of evidence from 17 studies supports medical mistrust as a barrier to HIV testing, engagement in prevention and care services, treatment uptake and adherence, and clinical outcomes. While findings mostly indicate that medical mistrust is a barrier to HIV prevention and care, some studies report null results and others suggest that medical mistrust may actually improve some HIV-related outcomes. Additionally, most of the reviewed literature was cross-sectional. Thus longitudinal, theory-driven research is needed to reconcile inconsistent findings and determine long term outcomes of medical mistrust. Interventions may then be developed to reduce the negative consequences associated with medical mistrust.", "Authors": "El-Krab R; Brousseau N; Kalichman SC", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "Journal of behavioral medicine", "Volume": "46", "Issue": "6", "Pages": "897-911", "DOI": "10.1007/s10865-023-00417-7", "citation_apa": "El-Krab, R., Brousseau, N., & Kalichman, S.

{"PMID": "35443306", "Title": "[Evaluation of China Comprehensive AIDS Response Program in 2020].", "Abstract": "Objective: To analyze the work indicators of China Comprehensive AIDS Response Program (China CARES) and provide reference for future work of the program. Methods: The scores of each indicator were calculated, and different scores among different types of program areas were compared. The M(Q1,Q3) was used to describe the score of each indicator. The entropy weight method was used to calculate the composite score of each indicator and the composite score was translated into a 100-point system and compared among indicators. Results: In terms of the first-level indicators, organizational leadership and management (96.0 points), publicity and education (94.0 points), and innovative strategies and measures (98.0 points) got relatively high scores; while comprehensive social governance of AIDS prevention (72.0 points) was with the lowest score. The scores of publicity and education and comprehensive intervention in county-level program areas were significantly lower than those in urban areas. For secondary indicators, the indicator with relatively lower scores included \"condom use among female sex workers last time\" (70.0 points)\", \"at least one local key population has an increase in the number of people receiving HIV testing compared with the previous year\" (70.0 points)\", \"colleges and occupational schools set up AIDS-related self-service facilities\" (65.0 points), \"HIV testing among the arrested people suspected of prostitution, adultery, drug users and traffickers\" (55.0 points) and \"condom use among men who have sex with men during last episode\" (50.0 points). The \"indicator 3 comprehensive intervention\" contributed most to the evaluation, while \"indicator 7 innovation strategies and measures\" played a minor role in the evaluation results. Conclusions: The overall situation of AIDS Response Program in 2020 was good, but the progress in different word areas was not yet balanced. The two areas of comprehensive intervention and comprehensive social governance of AIDS prevention should be strengthened. It is also suggested that relevant indicators be adjusted appropriately to improve evaluation indicators system and comprehensively promote the program.", "Authors": "Shan D; Li H; Zhao Y; Liu YF; Liu ZF", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi", "Volume": "43", "Issue": "4", "Pages": "517-522", "DOI": "10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20211005-00768", "citation_apa": "Shan, D., Li, H., Zhao, Y., Liu, Y.

HIV/AIDS activism among Black women for Black women may be one solution to reduce the disparate rates of HIV/AIDS among Black women. However, little is known about what processes and experiences prompt Black women to participate in HIV/AIDS activism. In this paper, I aim to identify mechanisms of empowerment for Black women to engage in HIV/AIDS activism. I draw upon empowerment theory as a theoretical framework to guide analysis of the literature and to offer a strengths-based perspective on Black women's efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. An extensive literature search was conducted to identify studies of Black women's participation in HIV/AIDS activism. The search yielded 11 studies that were included for review. Synthesis of the literature indicated the following analytic themes as mechanisms of empowerment for Black women to participate in HIV/AIDS activism: relationships and interactions with others, critical awareness, self-reflection, and spirituality. Article limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for social change are also discussed. Overall, findings from this study suggest that there are unique mechanisms that facilitate psychological empowerment and prompt Black women's entry into HIV/AIDS activism.", "Authors": "Rutledge JD", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "American journal of community psychology", "Volume": "71", "Issue": "3-4", "Pages": "491-506", "DOI": "10.1002/ajcp.12644", "citation_apa": "Rutledge, J.

It argues that while previous research has focused on how HIV informs COVID-19, the reverse relationship has received insufficient attention. The authors propose a more comprehensive understanding of the issues, using insights from the sociology of memory. Experiences during COVID-19 not only reshape perceptions of HIV in the present but also transform how we remember the AIDS crisis of the past. We discuss the impact of these pandemics particularly for gay and bisexual men and their connected communities. Doing so underscores the co-construction of collective memories in the present, suggesting that COVID-19 has not only redefined our experience of HIV, but it has also reframed our understanding of the earlier AIDS crisis. We conclude by highlighting the potential for these transformations to be leveraged for empowerment, political action and change.

The estimated probability and independent risk for mortality (all-cause and cause-specific) and treatment failure were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of 6813 participants (2448 non-LD, 3198 LD asymptomatic, and 1167 LD-AIDS), 161 (2.4%) died after ART initiation. At survival analysis, a higher probability of all-cause mortality has been identified for LD than non-LD (P <0.001) and within the former, for LD-AIDS over LD asymptomatic (P <0.001). After adjusting for confounders, LD showed a higher risk of all-cause mortality (vs non-LD adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 5.51, P <0.001) and, in particular, being an AIDS presenter predicted a greater risk of all-cause (aHR = 4.42, P <0.001), AIDS-related (adjusted subhazard ratio [aSHR] = 16.86, P <0.001), and non-AIDS-related mortality (aSHR = 1.74, P = 0.022) than the rest of the late presenters. Among the short-term survivors in the LD-AIDS group, the long-term mortality was mediated by the lack of immune recovery at 2 years. Finally, LD compared with non-LD and, particularly, among the former, LD-AIDS over LD asymptomatic showed a greater risk of treatment failure.\nCONCLUSIONS: In recent years, LD subjects, particularly, AIDS presenters, remained at a higher risk of poorer outcomes.

The main objective of the study is to minimize the number of HBV and HIV co-infected individuals in the community and the cost incurred to the effort applied towards protection and treatment control strategies. In this study, a novel HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection model has been formulated and analyzed to investigate the effects of protection and treatment control strategies on the spreading dynamics of the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection in the community. In the qualitative analyses we have computed all the models disease-free equilibrium points, all the models effective reproduction numbers and unique endemic equilibrium points, we have proved the two sub-models disease-free equilibrium points are locally as well as globally asymptotically stable whenever their associated effective reproduction numbers are less than one. In our understanding no one is formulated and analyzed the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection model with optimal control and cost-effective analyses so that we have formulated the associated optimal control problem and carried out the optimal control analysis on the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection model by implementing the Pontryagin's minimum principle. Numerical simulations with various combinations of the control efforts implemented are then carried out to investigate the impacts of protection and treatments to tackle the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection diseases spreading in the community. Finally, we also carried out cost-effectiveness analysis for the implemented control strategies. From the findings of the numerical simulations we observed that implementing all the proposed controlling strategies simultaneously has fundamental impact to minimize and control the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection spreading in the community but cost-effectiveness analysis proved that implemented strategy 4 (implemented the HIV protection and HBV treatment controls simultaneously) is the most cost-effective strategy as compared with all other implemented strategies and we recommend for the health stake holders and policy makers to implement this strategy to tackle the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection spreading problem in the community.", "Authors": "Teklu SW; Workie AH", "Year": "2025", "Journal": "Scientific reports", "Volume": "15", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "4004", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-024-83442-z", "citation_apa": "Teklu, S.

A critical evaluation of these materials demonstrates how the gay rights and disability rights movements were repeatedly juxtaposed to uncover strategies that could benefit HIV/AIDS activism, which inadvertently overlooked barriers that prevented the communities from cooperating.

The questions were designed from a standardised questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization.\nRESULTS: Most teachers knew about the principal causes of the major oral diseases and the means of disease prevention. Nearly all teachers (95.6%) were aware of HIV/AIDS and they knew (92.3%) a virus was the direct cause of AIDS. Teachers were well informed of the general symptoms of HIV/AIDS, although oral symptoms were mentioned less often. In all, 17.6% of schoolteachers reported that children suffering from HIV/AIDS were found in their classes and 10.3% of teachers were conscious of students receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Knowledge about the disease seemed to reflect mass media as a source, while teacher colleagues and health personnel played a somewhat lesser role in communication. In total, 83.2% emphasised that they should teach children about HIV/AIDS and the mouth. Schoolteachers from Tanzania (70.5%) were more often engaged in classroom-based oral health education than were the Burkinabe teachers (53.9%).\nCONCLUSION: The study confirms that schoolteachers may be a relevant source in the fight against HIV/AIDS among children. However, they would benefit from interaction with health personnel.", "Authors": "Petersen PE; Kahabuka F; Ouattara S", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Oral health & preventive dentistry", "Volume": "20", "Issue": "", "Pages": "69-76", "DOI": "10.3290/j.ohpd.b2805333", "citation_apa": "Petersen, P.

The proportion of those over 50 is around 30% and it has now become more likely that an older HIV-positive patient with other pre-existing illnesses will have to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) for a reason not directly associated with HIV than a person with a new HIV diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nevertheless, one third of patients with a new HIV diagnosis already have an advanced immune deficiency. Neurological or respiratory symptoms that require intensive medical care must be expected in these patients. The present article aims to raise awareness of these clinical pictures and the necessary differential diagnostics, and to provide the reader with an overview of the most important opportunistic infections and their treatment.

{"PMID": "40310879", "Title": "Sex-disaggregated data along the gendered health pathways: A review and analysis of global data on hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and AIDS.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health data disaggregated by sex is vital for identifying the distribution of illness, and assessing risk exposures, service access, and utilization. Disaggregating data along a health pathway, i.e., the measurable continuum from risk factor exposure to final health outcome (death), and including disease prevalence and a three-step care cascade (diagnosis, treatment, and control), has the potential to provide a holistic and systematic source of information on sex- and gender-based health inequities and identify opportunities for more tailored interventions to reduce those inequities.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected sex- and age-disaggregated data along the health pathway. We searched for papers using global datasets on the sex-disaggregated care cascade for eight major conditions and identified cascade data for only three conditions: hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS. For each condition, we collected risk factor prevalence, disease prevalence, cascade progression, and death rates. We assessed the sex difference for all steps along the pathway and interpreted inequities through a lens of gender analysis. Sex-disaggregated data on risk factors, disease prevalence, and mortality were found for all three conditions across 204 countries. Sex-disaggregated care cascades for hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS were found only for 200, 39, and 76 countries, respectively. Significant sex differences were found in each step along the pathways. In many countries, males exhibited higher disease prevalence and death rates than females, while in some countries, they also reported lower rates of healthcare seeking, diagnosis, and treatment adherence. Smoking prevalence was higher among males in most countries, whereas prevalence of obesity and unsafe sex were higher in females in most countries.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings support the increasing need to develop strategies that encourage greater male participation in preventive and healthcare service and underscore the importance of sex-disaggregated data in understanding health inequities and guiding gender-responsive interventions at different points along the pathway. Despite limitations in data availability and completeness, this study elucidates the need for more comprehensive and harmonized datasets for these and other conditions to monitor sex differences and implement sex-/gender-responsive interventions along the health pathway.", "Authors": "Feraldi A; Zarulli V; Buse K; Hawkes S; Chang AY", "Year": "2025", "Journal": "PLoS medicine", "Volume": "22", "Issue": "5", "Pages": "e1004592", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pmed.1004592", "citation_apa": "Feraldi, A., Zarulli, V., Buse, K., Hawkes, S., & Chang, A.

The basic tenets of network interventions such as (1) selection of a change agent, (2) segmentation, (3) induction, and (4) alteration represent myriad ways to structure network interventions for HIV prevention with the potential for large public health impact.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have employed the use of social networking websites such as Facebook to identify key persons to recruit others and disseminate information aimed at decreasing HIV transmission and improving safe sex practices among groups who are more vulnerable to HIV acquisition. Many of these interventions have successfully decreased HIV risk behaviors as well as decreased the spread of HIV among intervention cohorts.

This message requires clear and unambiguous evidence-based narratives that emphasise the message that there is zero risk of sexual transmission when an undetectable viral load is maintained and negligible risk when viral suppression (as defined by 200-1000 copies per mL) is maintained. Dissemination of this information to individuals living with or affected by HIV, health-care workers, communities, the general public, and policy makers will increase awareness and credibility of this message and challenge deep-seated misperceptions. Furthermore, understanding the impact of this evidence underscores the necessity to urgently prioritise universal access to quality care, including viral load testing; leverage community leadership to address structural barriers; and monitor for ongoing success.

{"PMID": "35666083", "Title": "Obesity: A comorbidity-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (CAIDS).", "Abstract": "Accumulating data emphasize a strong link between obesity and the severity of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), including mortality. Obesity interferes with several components of the immune system including lymphoid tissue's integrity, leukocytes' development and function, complement system's activation, and the coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses. Overall, obesity results in a less efficient immune response to infectious agents. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exploits this weakened immune system in people with obesity to precipitate COVID-19, and in some cases death. It is therefore the author's recommendation that obesity should be viewed as another form of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and be treated with the appropriate seriousness. Unlike the previously described acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), obesity is a comorbidity-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. People with AIDS do not die from HIV, but may die from opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, AIDS is ascribed its due importance in the course of deterioration of the patient. Similarly, obesity should be acknowledged further as a risk factor for mortality from COVID-19. Obesity is a modifiable condition and even in people with a strong genetic predisposition, lifestyle modifications can reverse obesity, and even moderate weight loss can improve the inflammatory milieu. Strong public health actions are warranted to promote lifestyle measures to reduce the burden from overweight and obesity that currently affect more than one-third of the global population, with projections alarming this may reach 55-80% within the next thirty years.", "Authors": "Siopis G", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "International reviews of immunology", "Volume": "42", "Issue": "6", "Pages": "415-429", "DOI": "10.1080/08830185.2022.2083614", "citation_apa": "Siopis, G.

The objectives of this study were to determine the knowledge and awareness of Sixth Form students regarding the spread of HIV and AIDS among young people. A study was carried out among Sixth Form students in three schools in Harare from October 2017 to November 2017. A total of 156 students participated in the survey. Results showed that most students (74%) obtained their information on HIV and AIDS from television and radio programmes. Most students (92%) were able to identify unprotected sexual intercourse as the major mode of HIV transmission, while 89% said that HIV could be transmitted through sharing injections. Some students had misconceptions about HIV and AIDS which might negatively influence their behaviour and attitude towards HIV and AIDS, for example, 11% of students said HIV and AIDS could be cured.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The human immune virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a major threat to the health of millions of people worldwide. In Ethiopia, there were more than a million people living with HIV/AIDS. The continuous and appropriate use of condoms, particularly among those who have HIV-positive clients, is essential to a comprehensive and long-term approach to avoiding HIV and other STIs as well as unintended pregnancy. But irregular condom use is regularly reported. There is inconsistent reports of the prevalence and correlates of frequent condom use in Ethiopia. This study's goal is to provide an overview of the most recent research on magnitude condom use among people living with HIV in Ethiopia.\nMETHODS: Four databases of PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used. Finally, 10 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The data were collected using a methodical checklist for data extraction, and STATA 14 was utilized for the analysis. The consistent condom use was reported as use of condom in every sexual encounter preceding the study. The prevalence of consistent condom usage among HIV/AIDS patients was calculated by dividing the total number of patients who regularly used condoms by the total number of HIV/AIDS patients and multiplying that result by 100. The factors associated with a consistent use of condom were described using the pooled odds ratio (OR) and calculated based on binary outcomes from the included primary studies. The statistical significance was determined based on the correlation factor as their confidence level should not include 1. Subgroup analyses by region and publication years were carried out by using a random-effects model. The STATA commands of metan magnitude semagnitude, random xlab(.1,5,10) lcols (authors) by (variables)texts(120) xsize(18) ysize (14) were used to carried out the subgroup analysis. To assess the presence of publication bias, funnel plot, Egger test and Begg's test at 5% significant level were computed. The asymmetry of funnel plot and the Egger test and Begg's test P value of 0 >0.5 showed the absence of publication bias. The Cochrane Q test statistic and I2 tests were used to assess heterogeneity.\nRESULT: The pooled magnitude of consistent condom use was 50.56% (95%CI: 38.09-63.02). The predictors of consistent condom use includes urban residence (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI: 2.24-5.35), marital status (AOR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.61), and HIV disclosure status (AOR = 5.61;95%CI: 2.29-13.73).\nCONCLUSION: Half of the HIV/AIDS patients in our study regularly used condoms. According to this study, urban residency, disclosure status, and marital status were all associated with consistent condom use among HIV/AIDS patients. Therefore, health education about condom use should be provided to married couples and people living in rural regions. In addition, disclosing HIV status and the necessity of constant condom usage would be crucial for consistent condom use.", "Authors": "Bekele F; Tafese L; Debushe T", "Year": "2024", "Journal": "PloS one", "Volume": "19", "Issue": "7", "Pages": "e0304248", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0304248", "citation_apa": "Bekele, F., Tafese, L., & Debushe, T.

The model equations are solved numerically using parametric estimation.\nRESULTS: In simulation studies, as the sample size expanded, the estimates derived from the modified sharp regression discontinuity model exhibited probabilistic convergence towards the true value, thereby validating the estimator of the Average Causal Effect's consistency. Counseling has an average causal effect in the sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) for compliers that is roughly equal to 0.199. This was the variation in Alcohol Use Detective Identification Test (AUDIT) threshold scores or the change in intercept scores when counseling was effective. Following six months of participation in the counseling program, AUDIT scores decreased, leading to an increase in Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts and a decrease in viral loads.\nCONCLUSION: The Modified Sharp RDD offers a robust approach to handle fuzzy variables in causal inference. Our study contributes to the advancement of RDD methodology and its applicability in real-world settings with uncertain data.", "Authors": "Mafukidze PK; Mwalili SM; Mageto T", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "BMC research notes", "Volume": "16", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "278", "DOI": "10.1186/s13104-023-06561-2", "citation_apa": "Mafukidze, P.

Many countries have had to revise their policies as new information on the virus, and its transmission dynamics emerged. In this paper, we track the changes in Botswana's HIV/AIDS response and treatment policies using a piece-wise system of differential equations. The policy changes are easily tracked in three epochs. Models for each era are formulated from a \"grand model\" that can be linked to all the epochs. The grand model's steady states are determined and analysed in terms of the model reproduction number, $ R_{0}. $ The model exhibits a backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium when $ R_{0} < 1. $ The stability of the models for the other epochs can be derived from that of the grand model by setting some parameters to zero. The models are fitted to HIV/AIDS prevalence data from Botswana for the past three decades. The changes in the populations in each compartment are tracked as the response to the disease and treatment policy changed over time. Finally, projections are made to determine the possible trajectory of HIV/AIDS in Botswana. The implications of the policy changes are easily seen, and a discussion on how these changes impacted the epidemic are articulated.

To know one's HIV status is a part of the human right to health. The disease has continued to be on the front burner for many years now, despite initial denials and cover-ups by some countries. Sub-Saharan Africa with just over 10 percent of the world's population has the greatest burden of this disease. It is estimated that close to two-thirds of all people living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa with South Africa having the highest number.\nOBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of premarital screening of HIV/AIDS among residents of rural areas of Itas Gadau local government area of Bauchi state, North-eastern Nigeria.\nMETHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used for the study. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 379 eligible respondents comprising residents of Itas and Gadau towns of Bauchi State. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select the participants for the study. Pearson's chi-square test was used in testing for the association between educational status and premarital screening for HIV/AIDS in rural areas. Results: The results show that all (100%) of the respondents have heard of HIV/AIDS and the dominant source of information was from friends (77.6%) followed by healthcare workers (17.4%). In addition, 90% of participants have good knowledge of premarital screening for HIV/AIDS. Majority of the study respondents had undergone premarital screening for HIV/AIDS (64.4%). The result also shows that there is a statistically significant relationship between educational status and the practice of premarital screening for HIV/AIDS in Itas/Gadau, Bauchi State with p-value of 0.001.\nCONCLUSION: The study found that there was a very high level of knowledge, good attitude, and practice for HIV/AIDS among the study respondents. Thus we recommend that the community should maintain the mandatory premarital screening and continue with regular health education on premarital screening for HIV/AIDS.", "Authors": "Maigoro AM; Usman US; Abdullahi AI; Salisu RB; Maje SS; Mohammed S; Mele UA", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "West African journal of medicine", "Volume": "40", "Issue": "11 Suppl 1", "Pages": "S12", "DOI": "", "citation_apa": "Maigoro, A.

Due to HIV taking away their parents leaves them deprived of their most important social network and support, which predisposes them to poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Various studies have shown poor adherence to ART among orphaned children and adolescents. This systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, aims to determine the level of ART adherence among orphaned children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS.\nMETHODS: This PROSPERO registered review (CRD42022352867) included studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Africa Journal Online, and selected HIV/AIDS journals from data inception to June 01, 2022. We included articles published in all languages that report the prevalence of adherence to ART among children and adolescent orphans (single parent orphans and/or double orphans) living with HIV/AIDS. We excluded qualitative studies, case studies, opinion papers, and letters to editors. We used the random-effect model to calculate the pooled prevalence of ART adherence based on the highest prevalence provided by the various methods in a particular study. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute Appraisal tool for the prevalence study to evaluate for risk of bias in the included studies. The Egger's test was used to assess small study effects.\nRESULTS: Out of 1087 publications identified from the various databases, six met the selection criteria. The included six studies had a total 2013 orphans living with HIV/AIDS. The pooled prevalence of ART adherence was 78∙0% (95% Confidence Interval: 67.4-87.7; I2 = 82.92%, p<0∙001) and ranged between 7∙6% and >95%, using one of the following methods: pill count, caregiver's self-report, clinical attendance, and nevirapine plasma levels (above three μg/mL). The factors associated with adherence were pill burden, caregiver involvement, stunting, and caregiver relationship.\nLIMITATION: There was a high level of heterogeneity in the finding.\nCONCLUSION: Approximately four fifth of orphan children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS adhere to ART.

{"PMID": "33467074", "Title": "The Impact of HIV- and ART-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cellular Senescence and Aging.", "Abstract": "According to the WHO, 38 million individuals were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 25.4 million of which were using antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2019. Despite ART-mediated suppression of viral replication, ART is not a cure and is associated with viral persistence, residual inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. Indeed, due to the presence of viral reservoirs, lifelong ART therapy is required to control viremia and prevent disease progression into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Successful ART treatment allows people living with HIV (PLHIV) to achieve a similar life expectancy to uninfected individuals. However, recent studies have illustrated the presence of increased comorbidities, such as accelerated, premature immune aging, in ART-controlled PLHIV compared to uninfected individuals. Studies suggest that both HIV-infection and ART-treatment lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in cellular exhaustion, senescence, and apoptosis. Since mitochondria are essential cellular organelles for energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism, their compromise leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and beta-oxidation, abnormal cell homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations and cellular apoptosis. The progressive mitochondrial damage induced by HIV-infection and ART-treatment likely contributes to accelerated aging, senescence, and cellular dysfunction in PLHIV. This review discusses the connections between mitochondrial compromise and cellular dysfunction associated with HIV- and ART-induced toxicities, providing new insights into how HIV and current ART directly impact mitochondrial functions and contribute to cellular senescence and aging in PLHIV.

Few contributions have been made in the area of quality indicators in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). To address this gap, a recent study conducted in the said area in 2023 resulted in the development of a comprehensive list of 88 indicators for assessing the quality of clinical care for HIV and AIDS. Out of these, 66 were identified as a core set of quality indicators for the assessment of HIV and AIDS clinical care. The aim of this study was to evaluate compliance with these quality indicators and determine those that are associated with mortality among people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) in the DRC.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, South Kivu province of the DRC. The study population included PLWHA adult patients who were followed for a period of five years at the antiretroviral (ARV) clinic from January 2017 to December 2021. Descriptive analysis was performed to evaluate essential characteristics, and inferential statistics were performed including a multivariable logistic regression analysis performed to assess the association between selected clinical care indicators and PLWHA mortality, to estimate the odds ratios of mortality based on various factors, and to control for confounding variables.\nRESULTS: A total of 884 PLWHA were included. The level of compliance with the quality indicators was 78.79%. In the multivariate analysis, the quality-of-care indicators associated with mortality in the follow-up PLWHA on treatment were items 12 (Late diagnosis of HIV infection in specialized care), 24 (Assessment of resistance in cases of virologic failure), and 38 (Evaluation of Cardiac risk). Other factors associated with mortality were male sex, lower CD4 (< 500mm3) and high viral load (> 50 copies/ml).\nCONCLUSION: The level of compliance with the indicators was moderate. Some quality indicators were associated with mortality. These indicators are associated with delayed diagnosis of HIV infection, assessment of resistances in case of virologic failure, and evaluation of cardiac risk.

The knowledge, attitudes, and sex education of freshmen were conducted with an online questionnaire. The log-binomial regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of HIV/AIDS knowledge. In addition, a structural equation model was used to analyze students' health needs that affect knowledge awareness and knowledge mastery.\nRESULTS: The overall awareness rate of AIDS knowledge was 87.4%. The students in undergraduate colleges (OR = 2.523, 95% CI=2.223~2.864) and independent colleges (OR = 1.389, 95%CI = 1.172~1.646) were more likely to have a higher awareness compared with the students in junior colleges. In this study, 2,011 freshmen approved of premarital behavior, 4,921 freshmen insisted on using condoms when having sex, and 8,138 freshmen were willing to take HIV antibody test when they suspected they were infected. In total, 4,703 freshmen believed that sexual health education was necessary for colleges and universities, and most of them (57.2%) hoped that sex education in schools should be improved. The direct effect of sex education on knowledge awareness and attitude is 0.15 and 0.58. The mediation effect test found that the pass ability knowledge path of sex education indirectly affected sexual attitudes (0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The awareness rate of HIV/AIDS among Jiangsu freshmen has not reached the national standard. Health education has a significant positive effect on knowledge awareness and attitude; however, students' needs in terms of time, place, and degree of sex education have not been met in time. It is necessary to strengthen the HIV/AIDS health education of college students in multiple ways.", "Authors": "Tu F; Yang R; Li R; Du G; Liu Y; Li W; Wei P", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Frontiers in public health", "Volume": "10", "Issue": "", "Pages": "892422", "DOI": "10.3389/fpubh.2022.892422", "citation_apa": "Tu, F., Yang, R., Li, R., Du, G., Liu, Y., Li, W., & Wei, P.

However, findings from both research studies and programmatic experience have helped to inform the growing body of knowledge regarding how to reduce stigma, leading to key principles for HIV stigma reduction. These principles include immediately addressing actionable drivers of stigma, centring groups affected by stigma at the core of the response, and engaging opinion leaders and building partnerships between affected groups and opinion leaders.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health's HIV prevention programs provide more comprehensive school-based education. This qualitative study evaluated the HIV/AIDS education program in the Lower Manya Krobo Municipality to assess the perspectives of students and educators in 10 schools on school-based sexual and reproductive health programs, including HIV/AIDS education and conflicting HIV/AIDS sex education policies. HIV prevalence in the Lower Manya Krobo Municipality of Ghana was more than twice the national average at 5.64% in 2018, and prevalence among youth in the municipality aged 15-24 was the highest in the nation at 0.8%. Educators have mixed feelings regarding abstinence-based and CSE approaches. However, students generally endorse abstinence and describe the limitations of condom use. Ambiguity in overarching policies is identified as a factor that could influence the orientation of school-based health educators, create disharmony in sex education interventions, introduce confusing sex education messages to young people, and create a potentially narrow curriculum that limits the gamut of HIV/AIDS sex education to exclude young people's risky sexual behaviours and diverse teaching and implementation strategies.

However, the reports on intestinal T. marneffei infection were rare. We report a case of disseminated T. marneffei infection with intestine involvement.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old female with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to our hospital for long-term fever, followed by abdominal pain and diarrhea. The colonoscopy performed in our hospital revealed ulcerative lesions in the colon and terminal ileum. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of intestinal ulcer revealed that the small dots distributed inside and outside of the macrophages were yeast microorganisms. Further culture of bone marrow sample was confirmed T. marneffei positive. A diagnosis of disseminated T. marneffei infection was made, with intestine involvement. We also summarized the clinical characteristics, endoscopic findings and histopathological features of intestinal T. marneffei by literature review.\nCONCLUSION: In HIV-infected and other immunocompromised patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or associated abdominal imaging abnormalities, intestinal T. marneffei infection should be taken into consideration.

Among the bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens that can be sexually transmitted, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has caused one of the most important pandemic diseases, which is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). 32.7 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic. Moreover, in 2019, 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide. The need to deal with this viral infection becomes more obvious, because it represents not only a problem for public health, but also a substantial economic problem. In this context, it is necessary to focus efforts on developing methods for prevention, detection and treatment of HIV infections that significantly reduce the number of newly infected people and provide a better quality of life for patients. For several decades, biomedical research has been developed allowing quick solutions through the contribution of effective tools. One of them is the use of polymers as vehicles, drug carrier agents, or as macromolecular prodrugs. Moreover, nanosystems (NSs) play an especially important role in the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy against HIV infection. The purpose of this work is to review recent research into diverse NSs as potential candidates for prevention and treatment of HIV infection. Firstly, this review highlights the advantages of using nanosized structures for these medical applications.

To overcome the low sensitivity and long turnaround time of traditional laboratory-based diagnostic strategies, we adopted metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology to identify and classify pathogens.\nRESULTS: This study enrolled 75 patients with AIDS and suspected pulmonary infections who were admitted to Nanning Fourth People's Hospital. Specimens were collected for traditional microbiological testing and mNGS-based diagnosis. The diagnostic yields of the two methods were compared to evaluate the diagnostic value (detection rate and turn around time) of mNGS for infections with unknown causative agent. Accordingly, 22 cases (29.3%) had a positive culture and 70 (93.3%) had positive valve mNGS results (P value < 0.0001, Chi-square test). Meanwhile, 15 patients with AIDS showed concordant results between the culture and mNGS, whereas only one 1 patient showed concordant results between Giemsa-stained smear screening and mNGS. In addition, mNGS identified multiple microbial infections (at least three pathogens) in almost 60.0% of patients with AIDS. More importantly, mNGS was able to detect a large variety of pathogens from patient tissue displaying potential infection and colonization, while culture results remained negative. There were 18 members of pathogens which were consistently detected in patients with and without AIDS.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, mNGS analysis provides fast and precise pathogen detection and identification, contributing substantially to the accurate diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and treatment appropriateness of pulmonary infection in patients with AIDS.", "Authors": "Zhong J; Liu Y; Luo N; Wei Q; Su Q; Zou J; Wu X; Huang X; Jiang Y; Liang L; Li H; Lin J", "Year": "2023", "Journal": "Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials", "Volume": "22", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "57", "DOI": "10.1186/s12941-023-00608-9", "citation_apa": "Zhong, J., Liu, Y., Luo, N., Wei, Q., Su, Q., Zou, J., Wu, X., Huang, X., Jiang, Y., Liang, L., Li, H., & Lin, J.

{"PMID": "39946225", "Title": "Substantial underdiagnosis and underreporting: changes in reported HIV and AIDS cases in 31 provinces in China at the beginning of COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Background China implemented extensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain COVID-19. Methods National and provincial data on monthly reported HIV and AIDS cases from January 2017 to December 2020 were collected from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. We used interrupted time series analysis to assess whether COVID-19-related NPIs had an impact on reported HIV and AIDS cases in 31 provinces in China, and estimated underreported numbers of HIV and AIDS cases in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 393,357 HIV cases and 254,735 AIDS cases were recorded in China from January 2017 to December 2020. Nationally, the number of reported HIV cases decreased by 25.1% in the first month of the NPIs period (January 2020) compared with the counterfactual (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.749; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.664-0.845), whereas the number of reported AIDS cases decreased by 36.5% (IRR 0.635, 95% CI 0.543-0.741). An estimated 2208 HIV cases (95% CI 1209-3335) and 1525 AIDS cases (95% CI 927-2233) were underdiagnosed and underreported in the first month of the NPIs in China. The highest numbers of underdiagnosed and underreported HIV cases in the first month of NPIs were estimated in Sichuan (IRR 577, 95% CI 239-978), Guangdong (IRR 185, 95% CI 170-200) and Henan (IRR 170, 95% CI 77-286). Conclusions There was substantial underdiagnosis and underreporting of HIV and AIDS cases during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and certain provinces.

Despite early successes, the region is well short of meeting these targets. The overall stalled progress in the HIV response has been further undermined by rising new infections among young key populations and the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the HIV situation, assesses the gaps, and analyses what it would take the region to end AIDS by 2030. Political will and commitments for ending AIDS must be reaffirmed and reinforced. Focused regional strategic direction that answers the specific regional context and guides countries to respond to their specific needs must be put in place. The region must harness the power of innovative tools and technology in both prevention and treatment. Community activism and meaningful community engagement across the spectrum of HIV response must be ensured. Punitive laws, stigma, and discrimination that deter key populations and people living with HIV from accessing health services must be effectively tackled. The people-centred public health approach must be fully integrated into national universal health coverage while ensuring domestic resources are available for community-led service delivery. The region must utilise its full potential and draw upon lessons that have been learnt to address common challenges of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics and achieve the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, in fulfillment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.", "Authors": "Murphy E; Shwe YY; Bhatia R; Bakkali T; Vannakit R", "Year": "2021", "Journal": "Sexual health", "Volume": "18", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "41-49", "DOI": "10.1071/SH20204", "citation_apa": "Murphy, E., Shwe, Y.

This will be achieved when the number of new HIV infections and 'AIDS-related deaths' decline by 90% between 2010 and 2030. So far, the rate of drop in AIDS-related deaths is on track, whereas the rate of drop in new HIV infections is off track to achieve Project 2030. Even if Project 2030 was achieved, HIV would be an endemic health problem. Hence, HIV prevention and control programmes cannot close down for the foreseeable future.

This risk may be driven, in part, by reduced immune control over viral infections in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), although the lymphomagenic mechanisms are not yet established. We used bead-based multiplex assays to measure antibody seroreactivity to 32 viral antigens representing 22 different viral infections (human herpesviruses 1-8, hepatitis B and C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus type-1, and human polyomaviruses) in two prospective HIV cohorts. Incident (n = 28) and prevalent (n = 38) AIDS-related NHL cases were matched by age, sex, race, and CD4 count to 67 HIV-positive control individuals without AIDS-NHL. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of AIDS-NHL with the number of different viruses to which an individual was seropositive and seroreactivity to individual antigens. Seropositivity to an increasing number of viruses was inversely associated with AIDS-NHL (OR per virus = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98). Seroreactivity to herpes simplex virus 2 2mgG unique antigen (OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.23-0.97) and to WU polyomavirus viral capsid protein (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.10-0.65) was significantly lower in AIDS-NHL cases compared to controls. In this evaluation of antibodies to multiple viruses, we observed an inverse association between seropositivity to a larger number of viruses and AIDS-NHL. While in need of further evaluation, our data raise the novel hypothesis that insufficient exposures or impaired humoral immune responses to viral infections may be associated with AIDS-related lymphomagenesis.", "Authors": "Song M; Bassig BA; Bender N; Goedert JJ; Winkler CA; Brenner N; Waterboer T; Rabkin CS", "Year": "2020", "Journal": "AIDS research and human retroviruses", "Volume": "36", "Issue": "5", "Pages": "381-388", "DOI": "10.1089/AID.2019.0208", "citation_apa": "Song, M., Bassig, B.

However, there are limitations in terms of population data and literature evidence based on recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) reports in East Africa. Therefore, this study aims to assess the comprehensive knowledge and PMTCT of HIV/AIDS among women, as well as the associated factors in East Africa.\nMETHODS: Our data was obtained from the most recent DHS conducted in East African countries between 2011 and 2022. For our research, we included DHS data from ten nations, resulting in a total weighted sample of 133,724 women for our investigation. A generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link and binomial family to directly estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between the independent variables, and the outcome variable. Finally, we reported the adjusted prevalence ratios along with their corresponding 95% CIs. Factors with p-values ≤ 0.2 for univariate logistic regression and < 0.05 were considered statistically significant factors of HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention in the final model.\nRESULTS: In this study, 59.41% (95% CI: 59.15-59.67) of respondents had a comprehensive knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention among reproductive-age women in East Africa. Being in the older age group, better education level, being from a rich household, employment status, having ANC follow up, institutional delivery, and modern contraception usage were associated with higher prevalence ratios of comprehensive knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention. However, being single in marital status, rural women, and traditional contraception utilization were associated with lower ratios of comprehensive knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a significant deficiency in comprehensive knowledge and prevention of HIV/AIDS MTCT among women in East Africa. These results emphasize the need for significant improvements in maternal-related health services. It is crucial to effectively target high-risk populations during interventions, raise awareness about this critical public health issue, and address the catastrophic consequences associated with MTCT.

Methods This retrospective study investigated the incidence, spectrum of and risk factors for infections during chemotherapy in 164 HIV/AIDS patients with lymphoma admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from July 2013 to December 2020. Results The median age of the patients was 43 years old; 90.9% (149/164) were male. A total of 112 (68.3%) patients had a CD4 count < 200 cells/μL at lymphoma diagnosis. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (56%, 91/164) and Burkitt lymphoma (28%, 46/164) were the two most common subtypes of lymphoma.

This study employed cross-sectional, quantitative survey that involved 291 children aged 10-17 years and their caregivers in the Lower Manya Krobo District, Ghana and examined their exposure to and experience of child maltreatment. The results show that at least one form of maltreatment was reported by approximately 90% of the children, and it was significantly higher among orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) as compared with comparison children. Older age, frequent changes in residence, non-schooling and living with many siblings are associated with child maltreatment.

The odds of client satisfaction were 6.72 times higher among study participants who do not have health insurance membership cards (AOR = 6.72 95% CI: 3.42, 13.91) compared to those who have health insurance membership cards. The odds of client satisfaction were 2.77 times higher among study participants who reported the availability of community referral for any social support (AOR = 2.77 95% CI: 1.12, 6.84) when compared to those who did not report. Those study participants for whom privacy was kept during the examination were 8.67 times higher to be satisfied (AOR = 8.67 95% CI: 2.53, 29.68) compared to those for whom privacy was not kept during the examination. In conclusion, the client satisfaction on HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality was relatively high in the study area. Occupational status, health insurance membership cards, availability of community referral for any social support and keeping privacy during examination have significant associations with HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality in terms of client satisfaction.", "Authors": "Haile Uma T; Tesfaye M", "Year": "2024", "Journal": "AIDS care", "Volume": "36", "Issue": "8", "Pages": "1080-1093", "DOI": "10.1080/09540121.2024.2365868", "citation_apa": "Haile Uma, T., & Tesfaye, M.

The polymorphisms of interferon (IFN)-λ4 have been postulated as possibly associated with the pathogenesis of HIV infection. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and mortality from a cohort of HIV-positive patients as well as whether IFN-λ4 gene polymorphisms (SNP rs8099917 and SNP rs12979860) were associated with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. We followed 402 patients for up to 30 years; 347 of them began follow-up asymptomatic, without any AIDS-defining opportunistic disease and/or a lymphocytes T CD4+ count of 350 cells/mm3 or lower. We determined the probability of the asymptomatic subjects to remain AIDS-free, and the risk of death for those entering the study already with an AIDS diagnosis, as well as for subjects developing AIDS during follow-up. We compared the prognosis of patients with two different polymorphisms for the genes encoding for IFN-λ4, variants rs8099917 and rs12979860. The follow-up time of the 347 asymptomatic-at-entry subjects was 3687 person-years. IFN-λ4 rs8099917 polymorphisms were not associated with AIDS progression, but IFN-λ4 rs12979860 wild type genotype (CC) was associated with higher mortality compared to CT and TT, with an increased probability of death from AIDS (P = .01).

Using state-level panel data from 2000 to 2019, I show that marriage equality legislation decreases the spread of (shorter-term) syphilis infections and of (longer-term) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infections among the general population. Event study analyses correcting for non-staggered treatment implementation confirm these negative effects, but also suggest that standard difference-in-differences models understate the impact of the legislation by up to 8% points. Further analysis supports that these legislation effects operate through three mechanisms: increasing social tolerance, strengthening relationship commitment, and expanding health care access and coverage for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Disaggregating the results by sexual behavior reveals that legal access to same-sex marriage leads to sizable decreases in AIDS rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) (the most at-risk population for an infection).

Their clinical expressions and severity depend on the evolution of the infection and become critical at the stage of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). They are essentially infectious, tumoral, and, starting a few years ago, iatrogenic. Infections are mostly fungal (candidiasis), viral (herpes, zoster, human papillomavirus infections, etc.), and less frequently bacterial (streptococcemia). Cases of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly syphilis, are multiplying preoccupyingly. The most frequently observed tumors are Kaposi's sarcoma. Drug intolerance is common; the symptoms are mostly dermatological, but also oral (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) when sulfonamides and certain antiretrovirals are used. The advent of prolonged Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapies (HAARTs) has led to a decline in the incidence of most opportunistic conditions, infections and tumors (except for multiple oral warts and zoster). HAARTs also provoke adverse reactions such as lipodystrophy syndromes (signs of peripheral atrophy and central hypertrophy, associated in varying degrees with metabolic syndromes).

HIV is one of the most hazardous of these as it attacks CD4 + cells, or T-cell lymphocytes, which are crucial to human immunity. To explore the variability of HIV/AIDS transmission, this study introduces a nonlinear stochastic mathematical model that incorporates a recovery compartment to account for hospitalized patients' progression to complete recovery and to better capture the intricate dynamics of disease transmission. Fractional derivatives are used with a generalized Caputo operator to enhance the accuracy of the model, effectively mixing the memory and genes that exist in biological systems. The model's validity is affirmed through considerations of positivity, boundedness, reproduction number, stability, and sensitivity analysis. Stability theory is employed to explore both local and global stabilities. Sensitivity analysis identifies parameters with a significant impact on the reproduction number. To establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, the model is qualitatively examined via fixed-point theory. Apart from that, a new numerical technique for simulations focused on the predictor-corrector strategy is implemented and MATLAB is used to verify the results. By comparing the fractional-order and integer-order derivatives, it is noted that the fractional-order method is the more accurate and realistic depiction of the dynamics of the disease. The suggested technique unlocks the door for more effective interventions giving researchers a competitive edge in learning about and managing the complex mechanisms of HIV/AIDS transmission.", "Authors": "Huang L; Anjam YN; Ali A; Rehman B; Tahir MA", "Year": "2025", "Journal": "Scientific reports", "Volume": "15", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "18212", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-025-01355-x", "citation_apa": "Huang, L., Anjam, Y.

For many years, Brazil served as a model in Global Health due to a comprehensive preventive policy, a partnership between the government and health activists and the support of life-saving drugs as public goods rather than commodities. The regression of AIDS policies in Brazil interacted with developments in the United States as well as with multilateral agencies like UNAIDS that emphasised biomedicalisation in the response to the disease where broad human-rights programmes and alliance with activists were not priorities. International programmes like the 'Ending AIDS' campaign indirectly undermined the exceptional status AIDS enjoyed since the late 1980s. The backlash in Brazilian policies to fight AIDS was a result of the fragmentation of the left and the empowerment of radical conservative authoritarian and religious forces.

Initially believed to have a low HIV prevalence mainly confined to high-risk groups such as injection drug users (IDUs) and commercial sex workers. However, HIV prevalence has steadily increased, with Punjab and Sindh provinces reporting the highest rates. Heterosexual transmission is the most frequent transmission route. High-risk populations include IDUs, men having sex with men, commercial sex workers, as well as truck drivers and miners. Furthermore, HIV has spread from urban centers to rural areas. The World Health Organization has reported over 200,000 HIV cases in Pakistan, making it the second-largest HIV-positive nation in Asia after India. The proportion of undiagnosed individuals is high and antiretroviral coverage is suboptimal. Fear of societal discrimination often leads individuals with HIV to hide their status, further spreading the virus. Mother-to-child transmission is another significant concern. Challenges in patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) exist, with many patients missing follow-up appointments. ART access due to shortages is frequent stemming from the reliance on imports.

Nigeria recorded the highest increase in the rate of ART coverage (72% increase) while Ethiopia had the least (30%). New strategies adopted to increase ART coverage and retention in most countries were community-based models and the use of mobile health technology rather than clinic-based. These strategies focus on promoting task shifting, door-to-door access to HIV services, and a long-term supply of antiretroviral medications. Most of these strategies are still in the piloting stage. However, some new strategies and frameworks have been adopted nationwide in countries like Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Malawi. Identified challenges include lack of funding, inadequate testing and surveillance services, poor digital penetration, and cultural/religious beliefs.

The use of high activity antiretroviral therapy has been widely used during treatment, which, added to the use of antibiotics, antifungals, and the patients' own immunocompromised state, cause important changes in the oral microbiota. The emergence of pathological microorganisms and with high resistance to drug therapies are frequent and cause serious damage to the oral health of these patients. In this sense, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) appears as a promising alternative in the control of these oral infections. The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of a therapeutic protocol for total oral aPDT mediated by a 660-nm red LED (light-emitting diode) associated with porphyrin in individuals with AIDS. Patients were selected by exclusion criteria and randomly distributed into groups to test the effectiveness of antimicrobial aPDT with 50 μg/ml porphyrin associated with the red LED. Before and after the treatments, saliva samples were collected and processed in duplicate in selective culture media. Colonies were counted and the results obtained in Log10 CFU/ml and tested statistically. It was concluded that aPDT was effective in reducing oral enterobacteria, in addition to reducing Streptococcus spp. and general count of microorganisms, when considering the numbers of TCD4 and TCD8 lymphocytes.", "Authors": "da Silva FC; Rosa LP; de Jesus IM; de Oliveira Santos GP; Inada NM; Blanco KC; Araújo TSD; Bagnato VS", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "Lasers in medical science", "Volume": "37", "Issue": "2", "Pages": "1227-1234", "DOI": "10.1007/s10103-021-03377-z", "citation_apa": "da Silva, F.

It was one of the first separate legal enforcement around the world that governs control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yet with significant limitations regarding human rights, as it criminalized HIV infection, and dictates penal action against 'transmitters'. This papers looks into how HIV/AIDS epidemic started in Korea in 1980s, with specific focus on disease narrative that was constructed by the government. It was known to United States Forces Korea, that HIV was already spreading steady into Korean female sex workers around U.S. military bases in 1985. This information was concealed by Korean Ministry of health, in the face of upcoming international events such as 1988 Seoul Olympics. Instead, the Korean government turned public attention to 'imported' cases, constructing narrative that HIV/AIDS as a foreign disease. With direction of president, HIV/AIDS control focus on compulsory testing and isolation of identified risk group of sexual minorities and sex workers around U.S. military bases. This narrative of foreign disease had lasting impact even after democratization of Korea in 1987, as civil society, unaware that HIV/AIDS had already became endemic in Korea, argued to enforced compulsory testing against foreign nationals upon entry. This paper argues that disease narratives were carefully constructed by the government during early phase of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Korea, and used legal structure as ways to conceal the actual prevalence from both domestic and international attention.", "Authors": "Jung J", "Year": "2025", "Journal": "Ui sahak", "Volume": "34", "Issue": "1", "Pages": "209-247", "DOI": "10.13081/kjmh.2025.34.209", "citation_apa": "Jung, J.

However, only a few studies have reported the presence of intestinal infection associated with T. marneffei. Herein, we reported a case of intestinal T. marneffei infection in a man who complained of a 1-month history of intermittent fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The result of the human immunodeficiency virus antibody test was positive. Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomorrah's methylamine silver staining of the intestinal biopsy tissue revealed T. marneffei infection. Fortunately, the patient's symptoms rapidly resolved with prompt antifungal treatment. In addition, we summarized and described the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with intestinal T. marneffei infection. A total of 29 patients were identified, the majority of whom (65.52%) were comorbid with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The main clinical features included anemia, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The transverse and descending colon, ileocecum, and ascending colon were the most common sites of lesions. A considerable number of patients (31.03%) developed intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Of the 29 patients, six underwent surgery, 23 survived successfully with antifungal treatment, five died of T. marneffei infection, and one died of unknown causes. T. marneffei intestinal infection should be considered when immunodeficient patients in endemic areas present with non-specific symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

Currently different treatments are available against HIV infection which can improve life expectancy of the patient but still it remains incurable. CCR5, which is also required as a co-receptor by majority of HIV strains for entry into the target cells, is now being targeted for gene therapy to develop HIV resistance in patients. In this review, we discuss different strategies that are being adapted for CCR5-gene disruption in CD4+ T cells and in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate a HIV-resistant immune system in infected individuals. If CCR5 gene that can shape HIV-resistant T cells, it will aim in new approaches in clinical trials. But these techniques have certain weaknesses and disadvantages, and will need to be paired with other strategies to form a full HIV remedy.

The classic recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) model was expanded into RFm, RF, RFL and RFmL models. In the observation dataset, the best predictive model was obtained using k-means clustering and C5.0 verification. Then, two rounds of k-means modelling were performed on the best model: data with R ≤ 6 months were retained, randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%) and used to perform the second round of modelling to subdivide the churn and non-churn patients. Next, an ANN algorithm was used to predict LTFU, and the confusion matrix with prediction datasets was constructed.\nRESULTS: The observation and prediction datasets included 16 949 and 10 748 samples, respectively. The RF model with three clusters and a quality of 0.82 was the best predictive model.

Up to today, there are still no definite criteria for immune recovery uveitis, and although closely associated with cytomegalovirus retinitis and HIV/AIDS, there are several cases of similar intraocular response in non-HIV patients. The exact pathology for this paradoxical inflammatory reaction remains unclear; however, there is an interest in identifying biomarkers to determine underlying mechanisms and identify patients at risk. The management of this disease also remains a challenge and no standardized treatment approach exists currently.\nSUMMARY: Immune recovery uveitis is an important cause of visual morbidity particularly in HIV/AIDS patients receiving highly active antiretroviral. It is a paradoxical reaction that is frequently associated with a prior cytomegalovirus retinitis infection.

We also documented a progressive increase in the proportion of viral load suppression as a result of ART expansion. While the pre-ART CD4 T cell count has increased steadily in recent years, there is still a large proportion of PLWH being diagnosed in later stages of HIV infection. New HIV diagnoses have been rapidly declining, however to a lesser extent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and BC is currently experiencing an increase in infectious syphilis cases in this population. These facts reinforce the effectiveness of TasP in decreasing HIV transmission, but at the same time, it highlights the need for further innovation to enhance the control of HIV and syphilis among MSM.

The objectives of the study were to (1) identify the girls' major sources of information on HIV/AIDS; (2) assess their exposure to HIV/AIDS media and their HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitude and practice; and (3) verify relationships between media exposure and HIV/AIDS KAP. Based on the Advertising Research Foundation's Hierarchy of Effects model, hypotheses were posed to test the relationships. A questionnaire survey was administered on a randomly selected sample of 500 Islamiyya girls in Bauchi, Nigeria, from an estimated population of 35,000. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results showed media exposure is not a significant predictor of HIV/AIDS practice, but it is a significant predictor of HIV/AIDS knowledge.

To assess the factors associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS, we have fitted a multilevel binary logistic regression model. Bivariable analysis was done to select eligible variables for the multivariable analysis. Finally, variables with p<0.05, in the multivariable analysis, were considered as significant predictors of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards HIV/AIDS in the 15 sub-Saharan African nations was 47.08% (95% CI: 47.08, 47.42), which ranges from 17.64% (95% CI: 17.22, 18.07) in Malawi to 79.75% (95% CI: 79.02, 80.45) in Guinea. In the multivariable analysis, both individual level and community level variables were significantly associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Being younger age, no formal education, never married, low socioeconomic status, male-headed household, non-contraceptive use, no mass media exposure, and incorrect comprehensive knowledge towards HIV/AIDS were among the individual-level factors that were associated with higher odds of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. While being from urban residence and the western SSA region were among the community-level factors that were significantly associated with higher odds discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS in 15 sub-Saharan African nations was high. Both individual and community-level factors were associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, special attention should be given to those who are poor, uneducated, and younger adults. In addition, it is better to strengthen the accessibilities of different media for adult populations to create an appropriate attitude towards people with HIV/AIDS.", "Authors": "Teshale AB; Tesema GA", "Year": "2022", "Journal": "PloS one", "Volume": "17", "Issue": "2", "Pages": "e0261978", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0261978", "citation_apa": "Teshale, A.
