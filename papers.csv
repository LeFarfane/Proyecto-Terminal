40522983,"Motivational interviewing pilot randomized trial targeting ethnically-, linguistically-, and racially-diverse mothers' Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) bedside presence.","OBJECTIVE: We evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of motivational interviewing (MI) designed to increase neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) presence among ethnically/linguistically/racially diverse mothers. We also assessed study design feasibility to inform a larger, future randomized controlled trial.
METHOD: We randomized 95 mothers to receive MI (intervention condition) or treatment as usual (control condition) during their baby's Level IV NICU admission. Eligibility criteria included mothers' adult age, English- and/or Spanish-language proficiency, and having a NICU-hospitalized infant. Using single-blind methodology, we assigned mothers to receive MI (n = 47) or treatment-as-usual (n = 42). Mothers rated intervention satisfaction, the extent to which MI motivated their NICU presence, and their openness to additional MI intervention. We evaluated MI fidelity to further assess MI feasibility.
RESULTS: Of 131 eligible mothers, 72.5% enrolled. Motivational interviewing-arm mothers received 1-6 weekly MI sessions. Regarding MI-arm mothers, 100% agreed to subsequent MI intervention, and 90% reported strong MI satisfaction. Eighty-seven percent of mothers reported that MI motivated them to be present in the NICU. Motivational interviewing interventionists achieved expert proficiency for 72.7% of coded MI sessions and basic competency for the remaining 27.3% of coded sessions. Mothers' MI perceptions did not differ by ethnic or linguistic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interviewing was feasible and highly acceptable across all ethnic/linguistic/racial groups, making MI a promising intervention to increase maternal NICU presence among mothers from traditionally marginalized groups. Future research should evaluate the extent to which MI can increase maternal NICU presence and enhance infant (e.g., medical/developmental) and maternal (e.g., postpartum depression, infant bonding) outcomes.",Faith MA; Sobalvarro S; Schimmel-Bristow A; Rawlins JT; Glock R; Miranda ASP; Dariya V; Acosta D,2025,Journal of pediatric psychology,50,6,456-466,10.1093/jpepsy/jsaf030,"Faith, M.

34376515,Efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) is recommended for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), if general lifestyle and dietary advice fails. However, although the impact of a low FODMAP diet on individual IBS symptoms has been examined in some randomised controlled trials (RCTs), there has been no recent systematic assessment, and individual trials have studied numerous alternative or control interventions, meaning the best comparator is unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis addressing these uncertainties.
DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through to 2 April 2021 to identify RCTs of a low FODMAP diet in IBS. Efficacy was judged using dichotomous assessment of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs, and interventions ranked according to their P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs (944 patients). Based on failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms, a low FODMAP diet ranked first vs habitual diet (RR of symptoms not improving=0.67; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91, P-score=0.99), and was superior to all other interventions. Low FODMAP diet ranked first for abdominal pain severity, abdominal bloating or distension severity and bowel habit, although for the latter it was not superior to any other intervention. A low FODMAP diet was superior to British Dietetic Association (BDA)/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) dietary advice for abdominal bloating or distension (RR=0.72; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94). BDA/NICE dietary advice was not superior to any other intervention in any analysis.
CONCLUSION: In a network analysis, low FODMAP diet ranked first for all endpoints studied. However, most trials were based in secondary or tertiary care and did not study effects of FODMAP reintroduction and personalisation on symptoms.",Black CJ; Staudacher HM; Ford AC,2022,Gut,71,6,1117-1126,10.1136/gutjnl-2021-325214,"Black, C.

38394983,Job satisfaction and burnout syndrome among intensive-care unit nurses: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The severe conditions often experienced in an intensive care unit, combined with poor working conditions, increase stress and therefore decrease job satisfaction. Sustained stress in the workplace leads to the development of burnout, a syndrome characterised by three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and perceived lack of personal fulfilment.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relationship between burnout syndrome and job satisfaction among ICU personnel.
DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus databases were used.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The study sample consisted of 18 quantitative primary studies conducted in the last five years. Validated questionnaires were used to assess burnout in ICU healthcare workers, the most commonly used being the Maslach Burnout Inventory.
EXTRACTION METHODS: The search equation applied was: ""job satisfaction AND nurs* AND burnout AND (ICU OR intensive care units)"". The search was performed in October 2022.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The search returned 514 results. Only 73 articles met the eligibility criteria. After reading the title and abstract, 20 articles were selected. After reading the full texts, 12 articles remained and after the reverse search, 18 articles were finally selected. The studies reported a 50% prevalence of burnout, all three dimensions of which were heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the study findings revealed an inverse association between burnout and job satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Job dissatisfaction of ICU nurses depends on lack of experience, working conditions or working environment among others. ICU nurses with lower job satisfaction have higher levels of burnout.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: This meta-analysis shows the potential value of job satisfaction on improving health outcomes related to burnout syndrome for nursing professional in Intensive Care Units. Different factors that could increase job satisfaction and consequently protect them from suffering high levels of burnout, such as salary, permanence in the service, mental health care are the responsibility of the hospital supervisor and, finally, of the own Health System. Knowledge of a risk profile based on the factors influencing job dissatisfaction would enable the implementation of effective workplace interventions to reduce or prevent the risk of burnout. Health policies should focus on protecting the worker, so in addition to improving working conditions, it would be interesting to promote coping skills in order to improve the quality of care and patient safety.",Quesada-Puga C; Izquierdo-Espin FJ; Membrive-Jiménez MJ; Aguayo-Estremera R; Cañadas-De La Fuente GA; Romero-Béjar JL; Gómez-Urquiza JL,2024,Intensive & critical care nursing,82,,103660,10.1016/j.iccn.2024.103660,"Quesada-Puga, C., Izquierdo-Espin, F.

35433498,Efficacy of Probiotics for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal condition. Studies regarding the treatment of IBS with probiotics have not yielded consistent results, and the best probiotics has not yet been confirmed. Therefore, we performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the relative rank order of different probiotics for IBS.
METHOD: We searched for RCTs on the efficacy of probiotics for IBS until August 25, 2021. The primary outcome was the symptom relief rate, as well as global symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, and straining scores. The NMA was conducted using Stata 15.0. We also used meta-regression to explore whether the treatment length and dose influenced the efficacy.
RESULTS: Forty-three RCTs, with 5,531 IBS patients, were included in this analysis. Firstly, we compared the efficacy of different probiotic species. B.coagulans exhibited the highest probability to be the optimal probiotic specie in improving IBS symptom relief rate, as well as global symptom, abdominal pain, bloating, and straining scores. In regard to the secondary outcomes, L.plantarum ranked first in ameliorating the QOL of IBS patients, but without any significant differences compared with other probiotic species in standardized mean differences (SMD) estimates. Moreover, patients received L.acidophilus had lowest incidence of adverse events. The meta-regression revealed that no significant differences were found between participants using different doses of probiotics in all outcomes, while the treatment length, as a confounder, can significantly influence the efficacy of probiotics in ameliorating abdominal pain (Coef = -2.30; p = 0.035) and straining (Coef = -3.15; p = 0.020) in IBS patients. Thus, we performed the subgroup analysis on treatment length subsequently in these two outcomes, which showed that efficacy of B.coagulans using 8 weeks ranked first both in improving the abdominal pain and straining scores. Additionally, B. coagulans still had significant efficacy compared to different types of probiotic combinations in present study.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this NMA suggested that B.coagulans had prominent efficacy in treating IBS patients, and incorporating B.coagulans into a probiotic combination, or genetically engineering it to amplify its biological function may be a future research target to treat IBS patients. With few direct comparisons available between individual therapies today, this NMA may have utility in forming treatment guideline for IBS with probiotics.",Zhang T; Zhang C; Zhang J; Sun F; Duan L,2022,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,12,,859967,10.3389/fcimb.2022.859967,"Zhang, T., Zhang, C., Zhang, J., Sun, F., & Duan, L.

37541528,Efficacy of Probiotics in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some probiotics may be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but differences in species and strains used, as well as endpoints reported, have hampered attempts to make specific recommendations as to which should be preferred. We updated our previous meta-analysis examining this issue.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (up to March 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with IBS, comparing probiotics with placebo were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk of global symptoms, abdominal pain, or abdominal bloating or distension persisting after therapy, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference with a 95% CI. Adverse events data were also pooled.
RESULTS: We identified 82 eligible trials, containing 10,332 patients. Only 24 RCTs were at low risk of bias across all domains. For global symptoms, there was moderate certainty in the evidence for a benefit of Escherichia strains, low certainty for Lactobacillus strains and Lactobacillus plantarum 299V, and very low certainty for combination probiotics, LacClean Gold S, Duolac 7s, and Bacillus strains. For abdominal pain, there was low certainty in the evidence for a benefit of Saccharomyces cerevisae I-3856 and Bifidobacterium strains, and very low certainty for combination probiotics, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, and Bacillus strains. For abdominal bloating or distension there was very low certainty in the evidence for a benefit of combination probiotics and Bacillus strains. The relative risk of experiencing any adverse event, in 55 trials, including more than 7000 patients, was not significantly higher with probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Some combinations of probiotics or strains may be beneficial in IBS. However, certainty in the evidence for efficacy by GRADE criteria was low to very low across almost all of our analyses.",Goodoory VC; Khasawneh M; Black CJ; Quigley EMM; Moayyedi P; Ford AC,2023,Gastroenterology,165,5,1206-1218,10.1053/j.gastro.2023.07.018,"Goodoory, V.

36729570,"mHealth Intervention for Improving Pain, Quality of Life, and Functional Disability in Patients With Chronic Pain: Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) is 1 of the leading causes of disability worldwide and represents a significant burden on individual, social, and economic aspects. Potential tools, such as mobile health (mHealth) systems, are emerging for the self-management of patients with CP.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to analyze the effects of mHealth interventions on CP management, based on pain intensity, quality of life (QoL), and functional disability assessment, compared to conventional treatment or nonintervention.
METHODS: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases from February to March 2022. No filters were used. The eligibility criteria were RCTs of adults (≥18 years old) with CP, intervened with mHealth systems based on mobile apps for monitoring pain and health-related outcomes, for pain and behavioral self-management, and for performing therapeutic approaches, compared to conventional treatments (physical, occupational, and psychological therapies; usual medical care; and education) or nonintervention, reporting pain intensity, QoL, and functional disability. The methodological quality and risk of bias (RoB) were assessed using the Checklist for Measuring Quality, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence, and the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool.
RESULTS: In total, 22 RCTs, involving 2641 patients with different CP conditions listed in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), including chronic low back pain (CLBP), chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP), chronic neck pain (CNP), unspecified CP, chronic pelvic pain (CPP), fibromyalgia (FM), interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and osteoarthritis (OA). A total of 23 mHealth systems were used to conduct a variety of CP self-management strategies, among which monitoring pain and symptoms and home-based exercise programs were the most used. Beneficial effects of the use of mHealth systems in reducing pain intensity (CNP, FM, IC/BPS, and OA), QoL (CLBP, CNP, IBS, and OA), and functional disability (CLBP, CMSP, CNP, and OA) were found. Most of the included studies (18/22, 82%) reported medium methodological quality and were considered as highly recommendable; in addition, 7/22 (32%) studies had a low RoB, 10/22 (45%) had some concerns, and 5/22 (23%) had a high RoB.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of mHealth systems indicated positive effects for pain intensity in CNP, FM, IC/BPS, and OA; for QoL in CLBP, CNP, IBS, and OA; and for functional disability in CLBP, CMSP, CNP, and OA. Thus, mHealth seems to be an alternative to improving pain-related outcomes and QoL and could be part of multimodal strategies for CP self-management. High-quality studies are needed to merge the evidence and recommendations of the use of mHealth systems for CP management.

35942669,Systematic review and meta-analysis: efficacy of peppermint oil in irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, with a complex pathophysiology. Antispasmodics are prescribed as first-line therapy because of their action on gut dysmotility. In this regard, peppermint oil also has antispasmodic properties.
AIM: To update our previous meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of peppermint oil, particularly as recent studies have cast doubt on its role in the treatment of IBS METHODS: We searched the medical literature up to 2nd April 2022 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of peppermint oil in IBS. Efficacy and safety were judged using dichotomous assessments of effect on global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain, and occurrence of any adverse event or of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We identified 10 eligible RCTs (1030 patients). Peppermint oil was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptoms (RR of not improving = 0.65; 95% CI 0.43-0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4; 95% CI 2.5-71), and abdominal pain (RR of abdominal pain not improving = 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.93, NNT = 7; 95% CI 4-24). Adverse event rates were significantly higher with peppermint oil (RR of any adverse event = 1.57; 95% CI 1.04-2.37).
CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint oil was superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS, but adverse events were more frequent, and quality of evidence was very low.

32702295,Global prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome according to Rome III or IV criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional bowel disorders, but community prevalence appears to vary widely between different countries. This variation might be due to the fact that previous cross-sectional surveys have neither applied uniform diagnostic criteria nor used identical methodology, rather than being due to true global variability. We aimed to determine the global prevalence of IBS.
METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from all population-based studies using relatively uniform methodology and using only the most recent iterations of the Rome criteria (Rome III and IV). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Classic (from Jan 1, 2006, to April 30, 2020) to identify cross-sectional surveys reporting the prevalence of IBS in adults (≥90% of participants aged ≥18 years) according to the Rome III or Rome IV criteria. We also hand-searched a selection of conference proceedings for relevant abstracts published between 2006 and 2019. We extracted prevalence data for all studies, according to the criteria used to define the presence of IBS. We did a meta-analysis to estimate pooled prevalence rates, according to study location and certain other characteristics (eg, sex and IBS subtype).
FINDINGS: We identified 4143 citations, of which 184 studies appeared relevant. 57 of these studies were eligible, and represented 92 separate adult populations, comprising 423 362 participants. The pooled prevalence of IBS in 53 studies that used the Rome III criteria, from 38 countries and comprising 395 385 participants, was 9·2% (95% CI 7·6-10·8; I2=99·7%). By contrast, pooled IBS prevalence among six studies that used the Rome IV criteria, from 34 countries and comprising 82 476 individuals, was 3·8% (95% CI 3·1-4·5; I2=96·6%). IBS with mixed bowel habit (IBS-M) was the most common subtype with the Rome III criteria, reported by 33·8% (95% CI 27·8-40·0; I2=98·1%) of people fulfilling criteria for IBS (ie, 3·7% [2·6-4·9] of all included participants had IBS-M), but IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) was the most common subtype with the Rome IV criteria (reported by 31·5% [95% CI 23·2-40·5; I2=98·1% 61·6%] of people with IBS, corresponding to 1·4% [0·9-1·9] of all included participants having IBS-D). The prevalence of IBS was higher in women than in men (12·0% [95% CI 9·3-15·0] vs 8·6% [6·3-11·2]; odds ratio 1·46 [95% CI 1·33-1·59]). Prevalence varied substantially between individual countries, and this variability persisted even when the same diagnostic criteria were applied and identical methodology was used in studies.
INTERPRETATION: Even when uniform symptom-based criteria are applied, based on identical methodology, to define the presence of IBS, prevalence varies substantially between countries. Prevalence was substantially lower with the Rome IV criteria, suggesting that these more restrictive criteria might be less suitable than Rome III for population-based epidemiological surveys.

33585949,Efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet in adult irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: This review provides an updated overview of observational and intervention studies investigating the effect of a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols) diet (LFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, quality of life (QoL), nutritional adequacy, and gut microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.
METHODS: We systematically searched available literature until October 2020 for studies that investigated the effect of LFDs on GI symptoms, QoL, nutritional adequacy, and the gut microbiome in IBS patients. The data were represented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for IBS severity, and as mean differences (MD) for IBS-QoL. Meta-analyses were performed for the quantitative analyses using random effects models with inverse variance weighing.
RESULTS: Twelve papers (nine parallel trials, three crossover studies) were included for the meta-analysis. The LFD reduced IBS severity by a moderate-to-large extent as compared to a control diet (SMD - 0.66, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.44, I2 = 54%). When analyzing only studies that used the validated IBS-SSS questionnaire, a mean reduction of 45 points (95% CI - 77, - 14; I2 = 89%) was observed. Subgroup analyses on adherence, age, intervention duration, IBS subtype, outcome measure, and risk of bias revealed no significantly different results. The LFD also increased IBS-QoL scores, when compared with a control diet (MD 4.93; 95% CI 1.77, 8.08; I2 = 42%).
CONCLUSIONS: The low-FODMAP diet reduces GI symptoms and improves quality of life in IBS subjects as compared to control diets. Future work is required to obtain definitive answers regarding potential long-term effects of such diets on nutritional adequacy and the gut microbiome.

32276950,Efficacy of psychological therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: National guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) recommend that psychological therapies should be considered, but their relative efficacy is unknown, because there have been few head-to-head trials. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to try to resolve this uncertainty.
DESIGN: We searched the medical literature through January 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of psychological therapies for adults with IBS, compared with each other, or a control intervention. Trials reported a dichotomous assessment of symptom status after completion of therapy. We pooled data using a random effects model. Efficacy was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic, with a 95% CI to summarise efficacy of each comparison tested, and ranked by therapy according to P score.
RESULTS: We identified 41 eligible RCTs, containing 4072 participants. After completion of therapy, the psychological interventions with the largest numbers of trials, and patients recruited, demonstrating efficacy included self-administered or minimal contact cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83, P score 0.66), face-to-face CBT (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80, P score 0.65) and gut-directed hypnotherapy (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91, P score 0.57). After completion of therapy, among trials recruiting only patients with refractory symptoms, group CBT and gut-directed hypnotherapy were more efficacious than either education and/or support or routine care, and CBT via the telephone, contingency management, CBT via the internet and dynamic psychotherapy were all superior to routine care. Risk of bias of trials was high, with evidence of funnel plot asymmetry; the efficacy of psychological therapies is therefore likely to have been overestimated.
CONCLUSIONS: Several psychological therapies are efficacious for IBS, although none were superior to another. CBT-based interventions and gut-directed hypnotherapy had the largest evidence base and were the most efficacious long term.

32949284,Endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Irritable bowel disease and endometriosis are two common diseases characterized by chronic inflammation state and recurrent abdominal pain. As a consequence of sharing of symptoms and chronic inflammation, endometriosis and IBS may coexist and be misdiagnosed and this leads to delays in diagnosis, mismanagement, and unnecessary testing. In recent years, some studies have found higher risk of IBS in women with endometriosis, compared to women without endometriosis. To provide a general overview, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis on published data on this issue.
METHODS: By a systematic literature search selection process, 11 studies were identified for the current study: 2 prospective and 2 retrospective cohort studies, 4 case-control studies, 1 cross-sectional study and 2 clinical series.
RESULTS: When we meta-analysed data about the prevalence of IBS in women with endometriosis, the overall OR (95%CI), compared to women without endometriosis was 3.26 (1.97-5.39) with no statistically significant heterogeneity. All three studies considering the incidence of IBS in women with a previous diagnosis of endometriosis showed about twofold greater risk among women with endometriosis than women without. Likewise, in the random effects model of the meta-analysis, the overall OR of history of IBS in women with endometriosis was 3.10 (95% CI 2.06-4.67), with no heterogeneity between three studies considered.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a link between endometriosis and IBS, highlighting two or more times higher risk of IBS in women with endometriosis compared to women without the condition.",Chiaffarino F; Cipriani S; Ricci E; Mauri PA; Esposito G; Barretta M; Vercellini P; Parazzini F,2021,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,303,1,17-25,10.1007/s00404-020-05797-8,"Chiaffarino, F., Cipriani, S., Ricci, E., Mauri, P.

36893621,Mediterranean diet and risk of breast cancer: An umbrella review.,"BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is a healthy dietary pattern which has been related to a lower risk of certain chronic diseases, such as some cancers. However, its role in breast cancer development remains unclear. This umbrella review aims to summarize the highest available evidence on MedDiet and breast cancer risk.
METHODS: Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic platforms were searched for relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The selection criteria included systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis including women aged 18 years or older which evaluated the adherence to a MedDiet as the exposure and incidence of breast cancer as the outcome variable. Overlapping and quality of the reviews using AMSTAR-2 tool were independently assessed by two authors.
RESULTS: Five systematic reviews and six systematic reviews with meta-analysis were included. Overall, 4 systematic reviews - two with and two without meta-analysis - were rated as of high quality. An inverse association was found in 5 of the 9 reviews which evaluated the role of MedDiet on the risk of total breast cancer. The meta-analyses showed moderate-high heterogeneity. The risk reduction seemed to be more consistent among postmenopausal women. No association was found for MedDiet among premenopausal women.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this umbrella review suggest that adherence to a MedDiet pattern had a protective effect on the risk of breast cancer, especially for postmenopausal breast cancer. The stratification of breast cancer cases and conducting high-quality reviews are aspects needed to overcome the current results' heterogeneity and to improve knowledge in this field.",González-Palacios Torres C; Barrios-Rodríguez R; Muñoz-Bravo C; Toledo E; Dierssen T; Jiménez-Moleón JJ,2023,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",42,4,600-608,10.1016/j.clnu.2023.02.012,"González-Palacios Torres, C., Barrios-Rodríguez, R., Muñoz-Bravo, C., Toledo, E., Dierssen, T., & Jiménez-Moleón, J.

38201996,Intermittent Fasting: Does It Affect Sports Performance? A Systematic Review.,"Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular types of diet at the moment because it is an effective nutritional strategy in terms of weight loss. The main objective of this review is to analyze the effects that intermittent fasting has on sports performance. We analyzed physical capacities: aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, strength, and power, as well as their effect on body composition. For this, a bibliographic search was carried out in several databases where 25 research articles were analyzed to clarify these objectives. Inclusion criteria: dates between 2013 and present, free full texts, studies conducted in adult human athletes, English and/or Spanish languages, and if it has been considered that intermittent fasting is mainly linked to sports practice and that this obtains a result in terms of performance or physical capacities. This review was registered in PROSPERO with code ref. 407024, and an evaluation of the quality or risk of bias was performed. After this analysis, results were obtained regarding the improvement of body composition and the maintenance of muscle mass. An influence of intermittent fasting on sports performance and body composition is observed. It can be concluded that intermittent fasting provides benefits in terms of body composition without reducing physical performance, maintenance of lean mass, and improvements in maximum power. But despite this, it is necessary to carry out new studies focusing on the sports field since the samples have been very varied. Additionally, the difference in hours of intermittent fasting should be studied, especially in the case of overnight fasting.",Conde-Pipó J; Mora-Fernandez A; Martinez-Bebia M; Gimenez-Blasi N; Lopez-Moro A; Latorre JA; Almendros-Ruiz A; Requena B; Mariscal-Arcas M,2024,Nutrients,16,1,,10.3390/nu16010168,"Conde-Pipó, J., Mora-Fernandez, A., Martinez-Bebia, M., Gimenez-Blasi, N., Lopez-Moro, A., Latorre, J.

Here we review the findings from EPIC on the relationship between diet-related exposures and incidence or mortality from the four most frequent cancers in the European population: colorectal, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and identified 110 high-quality studies based on the EPIC cohort. Fruit and vegetable consumption had a protective effect against colorectal, breast, and lung cancer, whereas only fruit had a protective effect against prostate cancer. A higher consumption of fish and lower consumption of red and processed meat were related with a lower risk of colorectal cancer; and higher consumption of fatty fish with lower risk of breast cancer. Calcium and yogurt intake were found to protect against colorectal and prostate cancer. Alcohol consumption increased the risk for colorectal and breast cancer. Finally, adherence to the Mediterranean diet emerged as a protective factor for colorectal and breast cancer. The EPIC study results are in agreement with the latest evidence from leading authorities on cancer prevention and help to inform public prevention policies and strategies.",Ubago-Guisado E; Rodríguez-Barranco M; Ching-López A; Petrova D; Molina-Montes E; Amiano P; Barricarte-Gurrea A; Chirlaque MD; Agudo A; Sánchez MJ,2021,Nutrients,13,10,,10.3390/nu13103582,"Ubago-Guisado, E., Rodríguez-Barranco, M., Ching-López, A., Petrova, D., Molina-Montes, E., Amiano, P., Barricarte-Gurrea, A., Chirlaque, M.

The efficacy of different probiotics in treating IBS remains controversial. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare and rank the outcome-specific efficacy of different probiotic strains or combinations in adults with IBS. We searched the literature up to June 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in IBS were included. A frequentist framework was used to perform this study. In total, 9253 participants from 81 RCTs were included in the study. Four probiotic strains and five mixtures were significantly superior to placebo in improving IBS Symptom Severity Scale, among which Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 ranked first (surface under the cumulative ranking, SUCRA, 92.9%). A mixture containing five probiotics (SUCRA, 100%) ranked first in improving the IBS-Quality of life. Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 (SUCRA, 96.9%) and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 (SUCRA, 92.6%) were among the most effective probiotics for improving abdominal pain. Three probiotic strains and two mixtures were effective in alleviating abdominal bloating. Four probiotic strains and a mixture were significantly superior to placebo in reducing the bowel movement frequency in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 (SUCRA, 99.6%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 (SUCRA, 89.7%) were among the most effective probiotics for improving the Bristol stool form scale of IBS-D.

39013599,Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia after acute gastroenteritis: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Disorders of gut-brain interaction may arise after acute gastroenteritis. Data on the influence of pathogen type on the risk of postinfection IBS (PI-IBS), as on postinfection functional dyspepsia (PI-FD), are limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine prevalence of PI-IBS or PI-FD after acute gastroenteritis.
DESIGN: We included observational studies recruiting ≥50 adults and reporting prevalence of IBS or FD after acute gastroenteritis with ≥3-month follow-up. A random effects model was used to estimate prevalence and ORs with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: In total, 47 studies (28 170 subjects) were eligible. Overall prevalence of PI-IBS and PI-FD were 14.5% and 12.7%, respectively. IBS persisted in 39.8% of subjects in the long-term (>5 years follow-up) after diagnosis. Individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis had a significantly higher odds of IBS (OR 4.3) and FD (OR 3.0) than non-exposed controls. PI-IBS was most associated with parasites (prevalence 30.1%), but in only two studies, followed by bacteria (18.3%) and viruses (10.7%). In available studies, Campylobacter was associated with the highest PI-IBS prevalence (20.7%) whereas Proteobacteria and SARS-CoV-2 yielded the highest odds for PI-IBS (both OR 5.4). Prevalence of PI-FD was 10.0% for SARS-CoV-2 and 13.6% for bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae 19.4%).
CONCLUSION: In a large systematic review and meta-analysis, 14.5% of individuals experiencing acute gastroenteritis developed PI-IBS and 12.7% PI-FD, with greater than fourfold increased odds for IBS and threefold for FD. Proinflammatory microbes, including Proteobacteria and subcategories, and SARS-CoV-2, may be associated with the development of PI-IBS and PI-FD.",Porcari S; Ingrosso MR; Maida M; Eusebi LH; Black C; Gasbarrini A; Cammarota G; Ford AC; Ianiro G,2024,Gut,73,9,1431-1440,10.1136/gutjnl-2023-331835,"Porcari, S., Ingrosso, M.

38999862,"The Efficacy of Probiotics, Prebiotics, Synbiotics, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with gut microbiota imbalance playing a significant role. There are increasing numbers of research studies exploring treatment options involving probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), but it is still uncertain which treatment option is superior. The research was conducted on various databases and unpublished trial data (up to February 2023). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were screened for adult patients with IBS comparing interventions with placebo. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and FMT were assessed for their impact using mean difference and Bayesian network meta-analysis. Out of 6528 articles, 54 were included for probiotics, 7 for prebiotics/synbiotics, and 6 for FMT. Probiotics showed improvement in IBS symptoms, particularly with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains. Prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement. Network meta-analysis indicated the favorable effects of probiotics (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.59) and FMT (OR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64) on IBS, with no serious adverse events reported. In short, probiotics and FMT are effective for managing IBS, with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus being dominant strains. However, the most effective probiotic combination or strain remains unclear, while prebiotics and synbiotics did not show significant improvement.",Wu Y; Li Y; Zheng Q; Li L,2024,Nutrients,16,13,,10.3390/nu16132114,"Wu, Y., Li, Y., Zheng, Q., & Li, L.

32144836,Worldwide prevalence of oral lichen planus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The objective was to assess the global oral lichen planus prevalence. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published before September 2019. We evaluated the quality of studies and carried out several meta-analyses. The global pooled prevalence was 1.01%, with a marked geographical difference (p < .001). The highest prevalence was reported from Europe (1.43%) and the lowest in India (0.49%), where tobacco-associated keratosis appears to mask oral lichen planus resulting in attenuation of its prevalence. From the age of 40 years, the prevalence increases significantly and progressively (OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 2.48-4.73, p < .001). Studies that define diagnostic criteria report a higher prevalence (1.31% vs. 0.70%, p = .03), although the application of the WHO criteria (year 1978-2007) does not increase the ability to diagnose the disease compared with other criteria (p = .11). The studies performed by oral medicine/oral pathology specialists report significantly higher prevalence (1.80%) than dentists (0.61%) and dermatologists (0.33%; p < .001). In conclusion, we propose that reliable diagnostic criteria should be defined, which should include a set of essential criteria including the presence of white reticular lesions in any location of the oral mucosa. The impact of histopathological confirmation with defined diagnostic criteria must be researched in the future, although its main use should be to determine the presence or absence of epithelial dysplasia. The necessity to improve the knowledge of oral lichen planus among dentists and dermatologists through continuing education is apparent in the results of this meta-analysis.",González-Moles MÁ; Warnakulasuriya S; González-Ruiz I; González-Ruiz L; Ayén Á; Lenouvel D; Ruiz-Ávila I; Ramos-García P,2021,Oral diseases,27,4,813-828,10.1111/odi.13323,"González-Moles, M.

31781857,Improving type 2 diabetes mellitus glycaemic control through lifestyle modification implementing diet intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a significant health problem. Many studies have reported that intensive nutritional intervention by itself or in addition to medications is the best method to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, in clinical practice, dietary education is not implemented as an integral part in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyse the scientific evidence concerning the role of nutritional intervention in the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from inception till May 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that include dietary interventions in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were included. Our results demonstrated that lifestyle interventions significantly lowered glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels compared to the usual care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, overall weighted mean difference, WMD = - 0.51 (- 0.67, - 0.35). Strategies combining individualized and group-based activities were the most effective, WMD = - 0.95 (- 1.24, - 0.66). Most of stratified analyses did not totally resolve heterogeneity, but improvement in HbA1c levels has been consistently observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence from RCTs shows that lifestyle intervention is more effective than the standard care regarding the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetic patients, particularly when there is a weight loss. It is time to translate this evidence to the primary health care practice.

The functional outcomes and knee stability at the same time points were also compared using isokinetic technology.
METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched the Medline (via PubMed search engine), Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases to include full text comparative studies that assessed isokinetic strength test following ACL reconstruction. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used.
RESULTS: In total, ten studies were included; seven compared studies QTAs vs. HTAs, and three compared QTAs vs. PTAs. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis. Isokinetic strength data were reported 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after ACL reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: The QTAs showed better and significant results with knee flexion compared with HTAs, similar results to PTAs at 6 and 12 months. While HTAs showed better and significant results with knee extension at 6 months and similar results at 12 months compared to QTAs.

38788892,The relationship between BDNF and physical activity on depression.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the leading causes of disease burden and disability worldwide. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems to have an important role in the molecular mechanisms underlying MDD aetiology, given its implication in regulating neuronal plasticity. There is evidence that physical activity (PA) improves depressive symptoms, with a key role of BDNF in this effect. We aim to perform a systematic review examining the relationship between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the BDNF protein, PA and MDD.
METHODS: Both observational and experimental design original articles or systematic reviews were selected, according to the PRISMA statement.
RESULTS: Six studies evaluated the Val66Met polymorphism, suggesting a greater impact of physical activity on depression depending on the Val66Met genotype. More discordant findings were observed among the 13 studies assessing BDNF levels with acute or chronic exercise interventions, mainly due to the high heterogeneity found among intervention designs, limited sample size, and potential bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is cumulative evidence supporting the potential role of BDNF in the interaction between PA and MDD. However, this review highlights the need for further research with more homogeneous and standardised criteria, and pinpoints important confounding factors that must be considered in future studies to provide robust conclusions.",Zarza-Rebollo JA; López-Isac E; Rivera M; Gómez-Hernández L; Pérez-Gutiérrez AM; Molina E,2024,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,134,,111033,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2024.111033,"Zarza-Rebollo, J.

36372047,Probiotics and synbiotics in chronic constipation in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics and synbiotics have been increasingly investigated for the management of chronic constipation. We aimed to investigate the effect of probiotics and synbiotics on stool output, gut transit time, symptoms and quality of life in adults with chronic constipation via a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: Studies were identified using electronic databases, backward citation and hand-searching abstracts. The search date was 10 July 2022. RCTs reporting administration of probiotics or synbiotics in adults with chronic constipation were included. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for probiotics and synbiotics. Results were synthesized using risk ratios (RRs), mean differences or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty RCTs investigating probiotics and four RCTs investigating synbiotics were included. Overall, 369/647 (57%) responded to probiotic treatment and 252/567 (44%) to control (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07, 1.52, p = 0.007). Probiotics increased stool frequency (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.37, 1.04, p < 0.00001), with Bifidobacterium lactis having a significant effect, but not mixtures of probiotics, Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 or Lactobacillus casei Shirota. Probiotics did not impact stool consistency (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.03, 0.54, p = 0.08). Probiotics improved integrative symptom scores compared to control (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.89, -0.04). Synbiotics did not impact stool output or integrative symptom scores compared to control.
CONCLUSIONS: Certain probiotics may improve response to treatment, stool frequency and integrative constipation symptoms, providing cautious optimism for their use as a dietary management option. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend synbiotics in the management of chronic constipation. Caution is needed when interpreting these results due to high heterogeneity and risk of bias amongst the studies.",van der Schoot A; Helander C; Whelan K; Dimidi E,2022,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",41,12,2759-2777,10.1016/j.clnu.2022.10.015,"van der Schoot, A., Helander, C., Whelan, K., & Dimidi, E.

35716771,Risk Factors for Abdominal Pain-Related Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction in Adults and Children: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many studies have assessed risk factors of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other abdominal pain-related disorders of gut-brain interaction (AP-DGBI); however, the role of these factors is unclear due to heterogeneous study designs. The aim of this systematic review was to extensively evaluate the literature and determine clinical risk and protective factors for the presence and persistence of AP-DGBI in children and adults.
METHODS: A PubMed search identified studies investigating potential risk and protective factors for AP-DGBI in adults and children. Inclusion criteria included fully published studies with a control group; exclusion criteria included poor-quality studies (using a validated scale). For each factor, the proportion of studies that found the factor to be a risk factor, protective factor, or neither was summarized. The number of studies, diagnostic criteria, number of subjects, and average study quality rating provided further context. Whenever possible, a meta-analysis generated pooled odds ratios or mean difference.
RESULTS: The systematic review included 348 studies. Female sex, gastroenteritis, abuse, stress, psychological disorders, somatic symptoms, and poor sleep were consistent risk factors for developing AP-DGBI in adults and children. In adults, additional risk factors included obesity, smoking, and increased use of medical resources. Protective AP-DGBI factors in adults included social support and optimism; no studies for protective factors were found for children.
CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple risk factors for AP-DGBI in adults and children. These include female sex, gastroenteritis, abuse, stress, poor sleep, obesity, psychological disorders, and somatic symptoms. Additional studies are needed in children, on protective factors, and on factors associated with persistence of AP-DGBI.",Zia JK; Lenhart A; Yang PL; Heitkemper MM; Baker J; Keefer L; Saps M; Cuff C; Hungria G; Videlock EJ; Chang L,2022,Gastroenterology,163,4,995-1023.e3,10.1053/j.gastro.2022.06.028,"Zia, J.

38725230,Diet-microbiota associations in gastrointestinal research: a systematic review.,"Interactions between diet and gastrointestinal microbiota influence health status and outcomes. Evaluating these relationships requires accurate quantification of dietary variables relevant to microbial metabolism, however current dietary assessment methods focus on dietary components relevant to human digestion only. The aim of this study was to synthesize research on foods and nutrients that influence human gut microbiota and thereby identify knowledge gaps to inform dietary assessment advancements toward better understanding of diet-microbiota interactions. Thirty-eight systematic reviews and 106 primary studies reported on human diet-microbiota associations. Dietary factors altering colonic microbiota included dietary patterns, macronutrients, micronutrients, bioactive compounds, and food additives. Reported diet-microbiota associations were dominated by routinely analyzed nutrients, which are absorbed from the small intestine but analyzed for correlation to stool microbiota. Dietary derived microbiota-relevant nutrients are more challenging to quantify and underrepresented in included studies. This evidence synthesis highlights advancements needed, including opportunities for expansion of food composition databases to include microbiota-relevant data, particularly for human intervention studies. These advances in dietary assessment methodology will facilitate translation of microbiota-specific nutrition therapy to practice.",Duncanson K; Williams G; Hoedt EC; Collins CE; Keely S; Talley NJ,2024,Gut microbes,16,1,2350785,10.1080/19490976.2024.2350785,"Duncanson, K., Williams, G., Hoedt, E.

32326280,Endocrine Disruptors in Food: Impact on Gut Microbiota and Metabolic Diseases.,"Endocrine disruptors (EDCs) have been associated with the increased incidence of metabolic disorders. In this work, we conducted a systematic review of the literature in order to identify the current knowledge of the interactions between EDCs in food, the gut microbiota, and metabolic disorders in order to shed light on this complex triad. Exposure to EDCs induces a series of changes including microbial dysbiosis and the induction of xenobiotic pathways and associated genes, enzymes, and metabolites involved in EDC metabolism. The products and by-products released following the microbial metabolism of EDCs can be taken up by the host; therefore, changes in the composition of the microbiota and in the production of microbial metabolites could have a major impact on host metabolism and the development of diseases. The remediation of EDC-induced changes in the gut microbiota might represent an alternative course for the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases.",Gálvez-Ontiveros Y; Páez S; Monteagudo C; Rivas A,2020,Nutrients,12,4,,10.3390/nu12041158,"Gálvez-Ontiveros, Y., Páez, S., Monteagudo, C., & Rivas, A.

The aim of this study was to search the recent knowledge of the protagonist played by high-intensity and high-duration aerobic exercise on gut microbiota composition in athletes and how these effects could provide disadvantages in sports performance. (2) Methods: This systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines. An exhaustive bibliographic search in Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted considering the articles published in the last 5 years. The selected articles were categorized according to the type of study. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews. (3) Results: Thirteen studies had negative effects of aerobic exercise on intestinal microbiota such as an upsurge in I-FABP, intestinal distress, and changes in the gut microbiota, such as an increase in Prevotella, intestinal permeability and zonulin. In contrast, seven studies observed positive effects of endurance exercise, including an increase in the level of bacteria such as increased microbial diversity and increased intestinal metabolites.

38627233,"Comparative efficacy of exercise, diet and/or pharmacological interventions on BMI, ovulation, and hormonal profile in reproductive-aged women with overweight or obesity: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide poses a significant threat to reproductive function owing, in part, to hormonal disturbances caused by negative feedback between excess adiposity and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Consequently, finding the most appropriate strategies to lose weight and improve ovulation in women with overweight or obesity is a clinically relevant matter that needs to be investigated. A comprehensive comparison of the independent and combined efficacy of lifestyle and/or pharmacological interventions on BMI, ovulation, and hormonal profile in women with overweight or obesity at risk of anovulatory infertility would facilitate improving fertility strategies in this population.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of exercise, diet, and pharmacological interventions on BMI, ovulation, and hormonal profile in reproductive-aged women with overweight or obesity.
SEARCH METHODS: A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library up to 14 December 2023, for randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of exercise, diet and/or pharmacological interventions (i.e. weight-lowering drugs or ovulation inducers) on BMI, ovulation, and/or hormonal profile in reproductive-aged women with overweight or obesity. We performed frequentist random-effect network meta-analyses and rated the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were BMI and ovulation rate, and the secondary outcomes were serum reproductive hormone levels (gonadotrophins, androgens, or oestrogens). We performed sensitivity analyses, including the studies that only involved women with PCOS.
OUTCOMES: Among 1190 records screened, 148 full texts were assessed for eligibility resulting in 95 trials (9910 women), of which 53% presented a high or unclear risk of bias. The network meta-analyses revealed that, compared to control: diet combined with weight-lowering drugs (mean difference (MD) -2.61 kg/m2; 95% CI -3.04 to -2.19; τ2 = 0.22) and adding exercise (MD -2.35 kg/m2; 95% CI -2.81 to -1.89; τ2 = 0.22) led to the greatest decrease in BMI; exercise combined with diet and ovulation inducers (risk ratio (RR) 7.15; 95% CI 1.94-26.40; τ2 = 0.07) and exercise combined with diet and weight-lowering drugs (RR 4.80; 95% CI 1.67-13.84; τ2 = 0.07) produced the highest increase in ovulation rate; and exercise combined with diet and weight-lowering drugs was the most effective strategy in reducing testosterone levels (standardized mean difference (SMD) -2.91; 95% CI -4.07 to -1.74; τ2 = 2.25), the third most effective strategy in increasing sex hormone-binding globulin levels (SMD 2.37; 95% CI 0.99-3.76; τ2 = 2.48), and it was coupled with being ranked first in terms of free androgen index reduction (SMD -1.59; 95% CI -3.18 to 0.01; τ2 = 1.91). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve scores suggested that: diet combined with weight-lowering drugs is the strategy most likely (94%) to produce the highest BMI reduction; and exercise combined with diet and ovulation inducers is the strategy most likely (89%) to produce the highest ovulation rate improvement. The sensitivity analyses, which exclusively included studies involving women diagnosed with PCOS, were consistent with the results presented above.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Overall, the findings of this network meta-analysis indicate that the combination of exercise, diet, and pharmacological interventions is effective for weight loss, improving ovulation, and normalizing the androgen levels of women with overweight or obesity. Although higher quality studies are needed, these results support that the optimal treatment strategy for women with overweight or obesity wishing to conceive must consider exercise, diet, and pharmacological interventions during the shared decision-making process.",Ruiz-González D; Cavero-Redondo I; Hernández-Martínez A; Baena-Raya A; Martínez-Forte S; Altmäe S; Fernández-Alonso AM; Soriano-Maldonado A,2024,Human reproduction update,30,4,472-487,10.1093/humupd/dmae008,"Ruiz-González, D., Cavero-Redondo, I., Hernández-Martínez, A., Baena-Raya, A., Martínez-Forte, S., Altmäe, S., Fernández-Alonso, A.

35766861,Physical activity for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Current recommendations for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to partake in physical activity are based on low-level evidence, do not incorporate evidence from all available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and provide little information regarding potential adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of physical activity interventions in adults diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and to explore possible effect moderators including type, setting and nature of physical activity interventions.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 5 November 2021. We handsearched reference lists and sought unpublished studies through trial registries.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs involving adults (aged 18 years or older) diagnosed with IBS and conducted in any setting comparing a physical activity intervention with no intervention, usual care or wait-list control group or another physical activity intervention group and assessing a validated measure of symptoms, quality of life or bowel movement.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted study data, and performed risk of bias and GRADE assessments to assess the certainty of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and synthesised data from other studies narratively.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs with data for 622 participants. Most (10/11) were set in high- or middle- to high-income countries, with five involving supervised physical activity, three unsupervised activity and three a mix of supervised and unsupervised activity. No trial was at low risk of bias. Four trials specified a minimally important difference for at least one assessed outcome measure. Data for 10 trials were obtained from published journal articles, with data for one obtained from an unpublished Masters degree thesis. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms Six RCTs assessed the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention compared with usual care on global symptoms of IBS. Meta-analysis of five studies showed an observed improvement in reported symptoms following physical activity (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.44 to -0.42; 185 participants). We rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as very low due to unclear and high risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision from sparse data. This means physical activity may improve IBS symptoms but the evidence is very uncertain. The results of the remaining study supported the meta-analysis but were at unclear risk of bias and sample size was small. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of a yoga intervention compared with a walking intervention on global IBS symptoms. Meta-analysis of these two studies found no conclusive evidence of an effect of yoga compared with walking on IBS symptoms (SMD -1.16, 95% CI -3.93 to 1.62; 124 participants). We rated the certainty of evidence as very low, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of yoga interventions compared with walking interventions on IBS symptoms. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention (yoga) compared with medication. One reported no observed difference in global IBS symptoms, though CIs were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the observed estimates and risk of bias was high (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.65 to 0.25; 21 participants). We excluded IBS symptom data for the remaining study as it used a non-validated method. One study compared a yoga intervention with a dietary intervention and reported an observed improvement in symptoms with both interventions but neither intervention was superior to the other. Quality of life Five RCTs assessed the impact of physical activity on self-reported quality of life compared with usual care. Meta-analysis of data from four studies found no improvement in quality of life following a physical activity intervention (SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.30 to 2.64; 134 participants; very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision). We rated the certainty of evidence as very low, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity interventions on quality-of-life outcomes in people with IBS. One study assessed the impact on quality of life of a yoga intervention compared with walking and observed an improvement in the yoga group (MD 53.45, 95% CI 38.85 to 68.05; 97 participants ). One study reported no observed difference in quality of life between a yoga and a dietary intervention. Abdominal pain Two trials assessed the impact of physical activity compared with usual care on reported abdominal pain. Meta-analysis found no improvement in abdominal pain with physical activity compared with usual care (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.50; 64 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low due to risk of bias and imprecision, meaning the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity interventions on abdominal pain in people with IBS. One study assessing the impact of a yoga intervention compared with walking advice reported no observed differences between groups on abdominal pain. One study comparing a yoga intervention with a dietary intervention found neither intervention had a more beneficial impact than the other and both interventions did not conclusively reduce abdominal pain. There was insufficient evidence to adequately assess adverse effects associated with physical activity due to a lack of reporting in trials. One study reported a musculoskeletal injury in a yoga intervention group but this did not result in withdrawal from the study.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Findings from a small body of evidence suggest that physical activity comprising of yoga, treadmill exercise or support to increase physical activity may improve symptoms but not quality of life or abdominal pain in people diagnosed with IBS but we have little confidence in these conclusions due to the very low certainty of evidence. The numbers of reported adverse events were low and the certainty of these findings was very low for all comparisons, so no conclusions can be drawn. Discussions with patients considering physical activity as part of symptom management should address the uncertainty in the evidence to ensure fully informed decisions. If deemed sufficiently important to patients and healthcare providers, higher quality research is needed to enable more certain conclusions.",Nunan D; Cai T; Gardener AD; Ordóñez-Mena JM; Roberts NW; Thomas ET; Mahtani KR,2022,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,6,6,CD011497,10.1002/14651858.CD011497.pub2,"Nunan, D., Cai, T., Gardener, A.

38173154,Symptomatic Response to Antibiotics in Patients With Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the symptomatic response rate to antibiotics in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Similarly, we performed a meta-analysis on the symptomatic response to antibiotics in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients with and without SIBO.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to March 2021. Randomized controlled trials and prospective studies reporting dichotomous outcomes were included.
RESULTS: There were 6 studies included in the first meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of antibiotics to placebo or no antibiotic. This included 196 patients, of whom 101 received antibiotics and 95 received placebo or no antibiotics. Significantly more patients improved with antibiotics (relative risk [95% CI] = 2.46 [1.33-4.55], P = 0.004). There were 4 studies included in the analysis comparing symptomatic response rates in IBS patients with or without SIBO with 266 IBS patients, of whom 172 had SIBO and 94 did not. The pooled response rate for symptomatic response was 51.2% in the SIBO group vs 23.4% in the no SIBO group, respectively. Significantly more IBS patients with SIBO responded to antibiotics compared to those without SIBO (relative risk [95% CI] = 2.07 [1.40-3.08], P = 0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics appear to be efficacious in treating SIBO, although small sample sizes and poor data quality limit this interpretation. Symptomatic response rates also appear to be higher in IBS patients with SIBO. This may be the first example of precision medicine in IBS as opposed to our current empiric treatment approach. Large-multicenter studies are needed to verify the results.",Takakura W; Rezaie A; Chey WD; Wang J; Pimentel M,2024,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,30,1,7-16,10.5056/jnm22187,"Takakura, W., Rezaie, A., Chey, W.

38754307,"The efficacy and real-world effectiveness of a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD) has been shown to effectively reduce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. Effects resulting from real-world studies may differ from those seen in efficacy studies because of the diversity of patients in real-world settings. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effect of the LFD on reducing IBS symptoms and improving the quality of life (QoL) in efficacy trials and real-world studies.
METHODS: Major databases, trial registries, dissertations, and journals were systematically searched for studies on the LFD in adults with IBS. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model with standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Outcomes of interest were all patient-reported: stool consistency, stool frequency, abdominal pain, overall symptoms, adequate symptom relief, IBS-specific QoL and adherence to the LFD.
RESULTS: Eleven efficacy and 19 real-world studies were reviewed. The meta-analysis results for abdominal pain (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.54) and QoL (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.50) showed the LFD was beneficial in efficacy studies with no statistically significant results for stool frequency (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.07). Real-world studies found improvements in abdominal pain and QoL. Due to heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was done for stool consistency and overall symptoms. In these outcomes, results were mostly supportive of the LFD, but they were not always statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest the LFD improves outcomes compared to a control diet (efficacy studies) or baseline data (real-world studies). Because of diverse study designs and heterogeneity of results, a clear superiority of the LFD over control diets could not be concluded. There are no indications of an efficacy-effectiveness gap for the LFD in adults with IBS.",Jent S; Bez NS; Haddad J; Catalano L; Egger KS; Raia M; Tedde GS; Rogler G,2024,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",43,6,1551-1562,10.1016/j.clnu.2024.05.014,"Jent, S., Bez, N.

35631213,A Low-FODMAP Diet Provides Benefits for Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms but Not for Improving Stool Consistency and Mucosal Inflammation in IBD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet (LFD) is claimed to improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms (FGSs). However, the role of LFD in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with FGSs remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the efficacy of LFD in IBD patients with FGSs.
METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception to 1 January 2022. Data were synthesized as the relative risk of symptoms improvement and normal stool consistency, mean difference of Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ), IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QoL), Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBi), Mayo score, and fecal calprotectin (FC). Risk of bias was assessed based on study types. A funnel plot and Egger's test were used to analyze publication bias.
RESULTS: This review screened and included nine eligible studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five before-after studies, involving a total of 446 participants (351 patients with LFD vs. 95 controls). LFD alleviated overall FGSs (RR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33-0.66, p = 0.0000) and obtained higher SIBDQ scores (MD = 11.24, 95% CI 6.61 to 15.87, p = 0.0000) and lower HBi score of Crohn's disease (MD = -1.09, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.42, p = 0.002). However, there were no statistically significant differences in normal stool consistency, BSFS, IBS-QoL, Mayo score of ulcerative colitis, and FC. No publication bias was found.
CONCLUSIONS: LFD provides a benefit in FGSs and QoL but not for improving stool consistency and mucosal inflammation in IBD patients.

Several drugs under advanced clinical development are addressed in this review. A systematic literature search was conducted in three electronic databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus) and in the ClinicalTrials.gov register from 1 January 2016 to 1 June 2023 to identify Phase II, III and IV clinical trials evaluating drugs for the treatment of PHN. A total of 18 clinical trials were selected evaluating 15 molecules with pharmacological actions on nine different molecular targets: Angiotensin Type 2 Receptor (AT2R) antagonism (olodanrigan), Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC) α2δ subunit inhibition (crisugabalin, mirogabalin and pregabalin), Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel (VGSC) blockade (funapide and lidocaine), Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition (TRK-700), Adaptor-Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1) inhibition (LX9211), Lanthionine Synthetase C-Like Protein (LANCL) activation (LAT8881), N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism (esketamine), mu opioid receptor agonism (tramadol, oxycodone and hydromorphone) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) inhibition (fulranumab). In brief, there are several drugs in advanced clinical development for treating PHN with some of them reporting promising results.

31859183,"Efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, and gut-brain neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Although novel therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) continue to be developed, many doctors rely on more established, traditional therapies as first-line or second-line treatment options. These therapies include soluble fibre (eg, ispaghula husk), antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators (including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or α-2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands). However, the relative efficacy of traditional treatments in patients with IBS is unclear because there have been few head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We aimed to compare and rank the efficacy of traditional therapies in patients with IBS to help inform clinical decisions.
METHODS: For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to week 2 of August 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials or supplementary data published up to Aug 18, 2019; and gastroenterology conference proceedings for study abstracts published between 2001 and Aug 18, 2019. We included RCTs that compared any of these treatments with each other (head-to-head trials) or with placebo, in which the efficacy of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, or gut-brain neuromodulators was assessed in adults (aged at least 18 years) with IBS of any subtype after 4-12 weeks of treatment. Only RCTs reporting a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, in terms of either improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in abdominal pain, were included. The efficacy and safety of all treatments were reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and treatments were ranked according to their P-score.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 5863 references, of which 81 were screened for eligibility. 51 RCTs with data from 4644 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis, but only 13 of these trials were at low risk of bias. Based on an endpoint of failure to achieve improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, peppermint oil capsules were ranked first for efficacy (RR 0·63, 95% CI 0·48-0·83, P-score 0·84) and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked second (0·66, 0·53-0·83, P-score 0·77). For failure to achieve an improvement in global IBS symptoms at 4-12 weeks, there were no significant differences between active treatments after direct or indirect comparisons. For failure to achieve improvement in abdominal pain at 4-12 weeks, tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy (0·53, 0·34-0·83, P-score 0·87); however, this result was based on data from only four RCTs involving 92 patients. For failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal pain, none of the active treatments showed superior efficacy upon indirect comparison. Tricyclic antidepressants were more likely than placebo to lead to adverse events (1·59, 1·26-2·06, P-score 0·16).
INTERPRETATION: In this network meta-analysis of RCTs of soluble fibre, antispasmodic drugs, peppermint oil, and gut-brain neuromodulators for IBS, few of which were judged as being at a low risk of bias, peppermint oil was ranked first for efficacy when global symptoms were used as the outcome measure, and tricyclic antidepressants were ranked first for efficacy when abdominal pain was used as the outcome measure. However, because of the lack of methodological rigour of some RCTs analysed in our study, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty around these findings. In addition, because treatment duration in most included trials was 4-12 weeks, the long-term relative efficacy of these treatments is unknown.

37375612,Efficacy of Different Dietary Patterns in the Treatment of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review of Intervention Studies.,"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children and adolescents. In recent years, interest in the role of diet in the treatment of FGIDs has increased. Currently, interest focuses on the low-FODMAP diet (LFD), the fructose- or lactose-restricted diet (FRD or LRD), the gluten-free diet (GFD), and the Mediterranean diet (MD). In this review, we focus on the role of these dietary patterns in the FGIDs most commonly diagnosed in clinical practice, namely irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal pain (FAP), functional dyspepsia (FD), and functional constipation (FC). Fifteen clinical trials were systematically reviewed (both RCTs and single-arm clinical trials). We demonstrated the lack of high-quality intervention trials. Based on current evidence, low-FODMAP diet, LRD, FRD, and GFD have no place in daily clinical practice for the management of children and adolescents with FGIDs. Nevertheless, some patients with IBS or RAP may experience some benefit from the use of a low-FODMAP diet or FRD/LRD. Limited data suggest that MD may be promising in the management of FGIDs, especially in IBS patients, but more data are required to investigate the mechanisms of its protective effects.",Katsagoni CN; Karagianni VM; Papadopoulou A,2023,Nutrients,15,12,,10.3390/nu15122708,"Katsagoni, C.

38279559,Comparative efficacy of oral Janus kinase inhibitors and biologics in adult alopecia areata: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.,"Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the hair follicles, resulting in patchy recurrent hair loss. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the favourable clinical response of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics, but a lack of comprehensive comparison among these therapies exists in the current literature. This study aimed to compare their efficacy. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed including randomized trials that report the outcomes of the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT)50 and/or the mean change in SALT. These articles were pooled and a network meta-analysis (NAM) was conducted. Based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve estimates obtained for the mean change in SALT score, baricitinib_4 mg (0.7949656) had the best probability of being the most effective therapy, followed by ritlecitinib_200_50 mg (0.7391906) and ivarmacitinib_4 mg (0.7292594). In contrast, dupilumab, secukinumab, tralokinumab and apremilast were less likely to be effective. Targeting the JAK signalling pathway holds great potential for restoring hair regrowth, albeit the contribution of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 inhibition to the therapeutic effect on AA is apparently different. Baricitinib_4 mg and ritlecitinib 200_50 mg demonstrated notable efficacy, and both molecules displayed a dose-dependent effect, which is not observed with ivarmacitinib. Further investigations into the specific mechanisms of action of these JAK inhibitors are warranted to elucidate the reasons behind these differences.",Husein-ElAhmed H; Husein-ElAhmed S,2024,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,38,5,835-843,10.1111/jdv.19797,"Husein-ElAhmed, H., & Husein-ElAhmed, S.

38738384,Febuxostat provides renoprotection in patients with hyperuricemia or gout: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"PURPOSE: It is unknown whether febuxostat can delay the progression of kidney dysfunction and reduce kidney endpoint events. The aim was to evaluate the renoprotective effect of febuxostat in patients with hyperuricemia or gout by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Web of science, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register for Randomized Controlled Trials were searched. The main outcomes included kidney events (serum creatinine doubling or progression to end-stage kidney disease or dialysis). The secondary outcomes were the rate of change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and changes in the urine protein or urine albumin to creatinine ratio from baseline to the end of follow-up. We used random-effects models to calculate the pooled risk estimates and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. In comparison with the control group, the patients who received febuxostat showed a reduced risk of kidney events (RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.84, p = 0.006) and a slower decline in eGFR (WMD = 0.90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI 0.31-1.48, p = 0.003). The pooled results also revealed that febuxostat use reduced the urine albumin to creatinine ratio (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.01, p = 0.042).
CONCLUSION: Febuxostat use is associated with a reduced risk of kidney events and a slow decline in eGFR. In addition, the urine albumin to creatinine ratio decreased in febuxostat users. Accordingly, it is an effective drug for delaying the progression of kidney function deterioration in patients with gout.Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42021272591.",Yang XH; Zhang BL; Cheng Y; Fu SK; Jin HM,2024,Annals of medicine,56,1,2332956,10.1080/07853890.2024.2332956,"Yang, X.

40258374,Efficacy of dietary interventions in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often interested in dietary interventions as a means of managing their symptoms. However, the relative efficacy of available diets for the management of IBS is unclear. We aimed to examine the relative efficacy of various dietary interventions in IBS.
METHODS: For this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to Feb 7, 2025, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing an active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food in IBS with either a control intervention, such as a habitual diet, sham diet, a high fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet, or alternative miscellaneous dietary advice, or any other active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food. We assessed efficacy using dichotomous assessments of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. We pooled data using a random-effects model, with the efficacy of each intervention reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. We ranked interventions according to their P-score, which measures the mean extent of certainty that one intervention is better than another, averaged over all competing interventions.
FINDINGS: We identified 28 eligible randomised controlled trials (comprising 2338 patients) of 11 different dietary interventions compared with four control interventions, of which six (low FODMAP diet, British Dietetic Association/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [BDA/NICE] diet, lactose-reduced diet, starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet, a personalised diet, and a Mediterranean diet) were studied in more than one trial. For global IBS symptoms, assessed in 28 randomised controlled trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked first (RR of global IBS symptoms not improving 0·41 [95% CI 0·26-0·67]; P-score 0·84; two trials), a low FODMAP diet ranked fourth (0·51 [0·37-0·70]; P-score 0·71; 24 trials), and a BDA/NICE diet ranked tenth (0·62 [0·43-0·90]; P-score 0·44; eight trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal pain, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised controlled trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked second (RR of abdominal pain not improving 0·54 [95% CI 0·33-0·90]; P-score 0·73; two trials), and a low FODMAP diet ranked fifth (0·61 [0·42-0·89]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal bloating or distension, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised trial, only a low FODMAP diet (RR of abdominal bloating or distension not improving 0·55 [95% CI 0·37-0·80]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials) was superior to a habitual diet and ranked fourth. For bowel habit, assessed in 23 randomised trials, none of the dietary interventions was superior to any of the control interventions, but a low FODMAP diet was superior to a BDA/NICE diet (RR of bowel habit not improving 0·79 [95% CI 0·63-0·99]). All comparisons across the network were rated as low or very low confidence, except for direct comparisons between a low FODMAP diet or a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet and habitual diet, both of which were rated as moderate confidence.
INTERPRETATION: In terms of dietary interventions for IBS, the most evidence exists for a low FODMAP diet, but other promising therapies are emerging and should be the subject of further study.

38711328,Effects of a low FODMAP diet on the symptom management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic umbrella review with the meta-analysis of clinical trials.,"A low FODMAP diet (LFD) is a common restrictive diet to manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, there is no consensus on the alleviating effects of this diet. Herein, a systematic umbrella review with meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of an LFD on IBS symptoms and its secondary outcomes in patients, which were not reported in previous meta-analyses. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science up to December 2023. The methodological quality of systematic reviews and their included trials was evaluated using AMSTAR 2 and the Cochrane risk of bias, respectively. The certainty of the evidence tool was evaluated using the GRADE approach. The data related to IBS symptoms, quality of life (QoL), microbiome diversity, and stool short-chain fatty acids were extracted. A random-effect (if RCTs ≥ 6) or fixed-effect model (if RCTs < 5) was used to recalculate effect sizes and 95% CIs and report them in both qualitative and quantitative terms (pooled risk ratio, Hedges' g, and weighted mean difference). A total of 658 articles were initially identified, with 11 meta-analyses and 24 RCTs reporting 28 outcomes with 1646 participants included. An LFD significantly affected the clinical improvement of total symptoms according to the IBS-SSS questionnaire (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.97; P = 0.04) in all the subtypes of IBS and also had favorable effects on stool consistency (WMD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.902, -0.07) and frequency (WMD: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.10) and some other GI symptoms in both less and more than 4 weeks of diet intervention except for stool consistency, which needed more than 4 weeks of LFD implementation. A significant QoL improvement was observed but not in the anxiety and depression state. Furthermore, some studies showed that an LFD may increase fecal pH and dysbiosis and reduce SCFA and the abundance of Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, an LFD can alleviate symptoms and QoL in IBS patients, although dysbiosis may occur. Considering the low certainty of evidence, strong RCTs with more appropriate designs are needed.",Khalighi Sikaroudi M; Soltani S; Ghoreishy SM; Ebrahimi Z; Shidfar F; Dehnad A,2024,Food & function,15,10,5195-5208,10.1039/d3fo03717g,"Khalighi Sikaroudi, M., Soltani, S., Ghoreishy, S.

39458528,Is Fasting Superior to Continuous Caloric Restriction for Weight Loss and Metabolic Outcomes in Obese Adults? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"BACKGROUND: fasting-based strategies (FBS) and continuous caloric restriction (CCR) are popular methods for weight loss and improving metabolic health. FBS alternates between eating and fasting periods, while CCR reduces daily calorie intake consistently. Both aim to create a calorie deficit, but it is still uncertain as to which is more effective for short- and long-term weight and metabolic outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of FBS and CCR on these parameters in obese adults.
METHODS: after screening 342 articles, 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 623 participants were included.
RESULTS: both interventions led to weight loss, with a reduction of 5.5 to 6.5 kg observed at the six-month mark. However, the results showed that FBS led to slightly greater short-term reductions in body weight (-0.94 kg, p = 0.004) and fat mass (-1.08 kg, p = 0.0001) compared to CCR, although these differences are not clinically significant. Both interventions had similar effects on lean mass, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glucose metabolism. However, FBS improved insulin sensitivity, with significant reductions in fasting insulin (-7.46 pmol/L, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (-0.14, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: despite these short-term benefits, FBS did not show superior long-term outcomes compared to CCR. Both strategies are effective for weight management, but more research is needed to explore the long-term clinical relevance of FBS in obese populations.",Siles-Guerrero V; Romero-Márquez JM; García-Pérez RN; Novo-Rodríguez C; Guardia-Baena JM; Hayón-Ponce M; Tenorio-Jiménez C; López-de-la-Torre-Casares M; Muñoz-Garach A,2024,Nutrients,16,20,,10.3390/nu16203533,"Siles-Guerrero, V., Romero-Márquez, J.

37211024,Overlap of disorders of gut-brain interaction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Rome criteria differentiate distinct types of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI); also known as functional gastrointestinal disorders. Overlap of symptom categories frequently occurs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the prevalence of DGBI overlap and compare overlap in population-based, primary care or tertiary care health settings. Furthermore, we aimed to compare symptom severity of psychological comorbidities in DGBI with and without overlap.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase electronic databases from inception until March 1, 2022, for original articles and conference abstracts of observational cross-sectional, case-controlled, or cohort design studies that reported the prevalence of DGBI overlap in adult participants (aged ≥18 years). We included only those studies where the diagnosis of DGBI was based on clinical assessment, questionnaire data, or specific symptom-based criteria. Studies were excluded if reporting on mixed populations of DGBI and organic diseases. Aggregate patient data were extracted from eligible published studies. The prevalence of DGBI overlap in all studies was pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model, and further analysis stratified by subgroups (care setting, diagnostic criteria, geographic region, and gross domestic product per capita). We also assessed the relationship between DGBI overlap with anxiety, depression, and quality of life symptom scores. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022311101).
FINDINGS: 46 of 1268 screened studies, reporting on 75 682 adult DGBI participants, were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Overall, 24 424 (pooled prevalence 36·5% [95% CI 30·7 to 42·6]) participants had a DGBI overlap, with considerable between-study heterogeneity (I2=99·51, p=0·0001). In the tertiary health-care setting, overlap among participants with DGBI was more prevalent (8373 of 22 617, pooled prevalence 47·3% [95% CI 33·2 to 61·7]) compared with population-based cohorts (11 332 of 39 749, pooled prevalence 26·5% [95% CI 20·5 to 33·4]; odds ratio 2·50 [95% CI 1·28 to 4·87]; p=0·0084). Quality of life physical component scores were significantly lower in participants with DGBI overlap compared with participants without overlap (standardised mean difference -0·47 [95% CI -0·80 to -0·14]; p=0·025). Participants with DGBI overlap had both increased symptom scores for anxiety (0·39 [95% CI 0·24 to 0·54]; p=0·0001) and depression (0·41 [0·30 to 0·51]; p=0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Overlap of DGBI subtypes is frequent, and is more prevalent in tertiary care settings and associated with more severe symptom manifestations or psychological comorbidities. Despite the large sample size, the comparative analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity, and the results should be interpreted with caution.

36681019,Positive psychological well-being and clinical characteristics in IBS: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Psychological factors (e.g., depression, anxiety) are known to contribute to the development and maintenance of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Less is known, however, about the role of positive psychological well-being (PPWB) in IBS. Accordingly, we completed a systematic review of the literature examining relationships between PPWB and clinical characteristics in IBS.
METHOD: A systematic review using search terms related to PPWB and IBS from inception through July 28, 2022, was completed. Quality was assessed with the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. A narrative synthesis of findings, rather than meta-analysis, was completed due to study heterogeneity.
RESULTS: 22 articles with a total of 4285 participants with IBS met inclusion criteria. Individuals with IBS had lower levels of PPWB (e.g., resilience, positive affect, self-efficacy, emotion regulation) compared to healthy populations, which in turn was associated with reduced physical and mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Limited exploration of potential biological mechanisms underlying these relationships has been described.
CONCLUSIONS: PPWB is diminished in individuals with IBS compared to other populations, and greater PPWB is linked to superior physical, psychological, and HRQoL outcomes. Interventions to increase PPWB may have the potential to improve IBS-related outcomes.

38777133,Effect of Brain-Gut Behavioral Treatments on Abdominal Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some brain-gut behavioral treatments (BGBTs) are beneficial for global symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). United States management guidelines suggest their use in patients with persistent abdominal pain, but their specific effect on this symptom has not been assessed systematically.
METHODS: We searched the literature through December 16, 2023, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of BGBTs for adults with IBS, compared with each other or a control intervention. Trials provided an assessment of abdominal pain resolution or improvement at treatment completion. We extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming dropouts to be treatment failures and reporting pooled relative risks (RRs) of abdominal pain not improving with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), ranking therapies according to the P score.
RESULTS: We identified 42 eligible randomized controlled trials comprising 5220 participants. After treatment completion, the BGBTs with the largest numbers of trials and patients recruited demonstrating efficacy for abdominal pain, specifically, included self-guided/minimal contact cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95; P score, 0.58), face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97; P score, 0.56), and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96; P score, 0.49). Among trials recruiting only patients with refractory global IBS symptoms, group CBT was more efficacious than routine care for abdominal pain, but no other significant differences were detected. No trials were low risk of bias across all domains, and there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry.
CONCLUSIONS: Several BGBTs, including self-guided/minimal contact CBT, face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy, and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy may be efficacious for abdominal pain in IBS, although none was superior to another.",Goodoory VC; Khasawneh M; Thakur ER; Everitt HA; Gudleski GD; Lackner JM; Moss-Morris R; Simren M; Vasant DH; Moayyedi P; Black CJ; Ford AC,2024,Gastroenterology,167,5,934-943.e5,10.1053/j.gastro.2024.05.010,"Goodoory, V.

38618735,Assessing the 5-year persistence in positive clinical response with innovative psoriasis treatments: a network meta-analysis of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score.,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition, for which the approval of several biologics has made a dramatic impact. Despite their initial treatment effectiveness, the challenge lies in understanding the long-term responses, as they may diminish over time. Limitations of drug survival analysis warrant the application of additional outcomes to fully capture the performance of a biologic.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a broader perspective on the global landscape of biologic agents' persistence in positive clinical response by comparing innovative therapies over a 5-year period through a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS: We comprehensively identified studies in PubMed, Embase, Scopus and ClinicalTrials.gov. We defined two outcomes: (i) 'persistence at optimal response' (POR) or 'clinical remission', and (ii) 'persistence at suboptimal response' (PSR) or 'low disease activity'. Outcomes were measured as the proportions of patients with continuous exposure to a biologic who achieved ≥ 90% or 100% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at the end of the predefined 5-year follow-up period.
RESULTS: Eleven publications, comprising 18 randomized controlled trials and 11 202 patients, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the network meta-analysis. In the ranking analysis, guselkumab exhibited the highest cumulative probability of POR (0.84), followed by ixekizumab (0.82) and risankizumab (0.76). Conversely, etanercept (0.42), brodalumab (0.36), apremilast (0.25) and placebo (0.026) showed the lowest cumulative probabilities of POR. For PSR, guselkumab (0.86), ixekizumab (0.75) and risankizumab (0.71) also ranked highest, while brodalumab (0.42), secukinumab (0.23), etanercept (0.19) and placebo (0.019) presented the lowest PSR probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The highest rates of persistence with clear or almost clear skin can be expected with guselkumab, ixekizumab and risankizumab compared with other biologics. The proposed proxy definitions of long-term persistence (POR and PSR) are reliable measures of patients being successfully treated that warrant further exploration and validation.",Husein-ElAhmed H; Husein-ElAhmed S,2024,Clinical and experimental dermatology,49,10,1148-1155,10.1093/ced/llae131,"Husein-ElAhmed, H., & Husein-ElAhmed, S.

39048485,"Physical activity, sedentary behavior and microbiome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: The effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior on human health are well known, however, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Growing evidence points to physical activity as an important modulator of the composition and function of microbial communities, while evidence of sedentary behavior is scarce. We aimed to synthesize and meta-analyze the current evidence about the effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior on microbiome across different body sites and in different populations.
METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases was conducted until September 2022. Random-effects meta-analyses including cross-sectional studies (active vs. inactive/athletes vs. non-athletes) or trials reporting the chronic effect of physical activity interventions on gut microbiome alpha-diversity in healthy individuals were performed.
RESULTS: Ninety-one studies were included in this systematic review. Our meta-analyses of 2632 participants indicated no consistent effect of physical activity on microbial alpha-diversity, although there seems to be a trend toward a higher microbial richness in athletes compared to non-athletes. Most of studies reported an increase in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria such as Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Veillonella or Roseburia in active individuals and after physical activity interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity levels were positively associated with the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. Athletes seem to have a richer microbiome compared to non-athletes. However, high heterogeneity between studies avoids obtaining conclusive information on the role of physical activity in microbial composition. Future multi-omics studies would enhance our understanding of the molecular effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior on the microbiome.",Pérez-Prieto I; Plaza-Florido A; Ubago-Guisado E; Ortega FB; Altmäe S,2024,Journal of science and medicine in sport,27,11,793-804,10.1016/j.jsams.2024.07.003,"Pérez-Prieto, I., Plaza-Florido, A., Ubago-Guisado, E., Ortega, F.

35957857,Endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analyses.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the pooled odds ratio of endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome, and to estimate the pooled prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in patients with endometriosis.
DATA SOURCES: Using Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Science Direct, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, and CINAHL, we conducted a systematic literature search through October 2021, using the key terms ""endometriosis"" and ""irritable bowel syndrome."" Articles had to be published in English or Spanish. No restriction on geographical location was applied.
METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The following eligibility criteria were applied: full-text original articles; human studies; studies that investigated the association between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome. Two investigators screened and reviewed the studies. A total of 1,776 studies were identified in 6 separate databases. After screening and applying the eligibility criteria, a total of 17 studies were included for analyses. The meta-analysis of association between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome included 11 studies, and the meta-analysis on the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in endometriosis included 6 studies.
TABULATION INTEGRATION AND RESULTS: Overall 96,119 subjects were included in the main meta-analysis (11 studies) for endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome, with 18,887 endometriosis patients and 77,171 controls. The odds of irritable bowel syndrome were approximately 3 times higher among patients with endometriosis compared with healthy controls (odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval, 2.17 - 4.06). Similar results were obtained after subgroup analyses by endometriosis diagnosis, irritable bowel syndrome diagnostic criteria, and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores. Six studies reported prevalence rates of irritable bowel syndrome in women with endometriosis, ranging from 10.6 to 52%. The pooled prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in women with endometriosis was 23.4% (95% confidence interval, 9.7 - 37.2).
CONCLUSION: Patients with endometriosis have an approximately threefold increased risk of developing irritable bowel syndrome. Development and recent update of Rome criteria has evolved the diagnosis of IBS, potential bias should still be considered as there are no specific tests available for diagnosis.

36858143,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Efficacy of Mesalamine in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) demonstrate low-grade inflammation in the intestine. Mesalamine, which has anti-inflammatory effects, may be an efficacious treatment for IBS, but studies are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of mesalamine in IBS.
METHODS: We searched the medical literature up to September 14, 2022, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mesalamine in IBS. We judged efficacy and safety using dichotomous assessments of effect on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain, bowel habit or stool frequency, and occurrence of any adverse event. We pooled data using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We identified 8 eligible RCTs (820 patients). Mesalamine was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptoms (RR of global symptoms not improving, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95; number needed to treat = 10; 95% CI, 6-27), but not for abdominal pain or bowel habit or stool frequency. Subgroup analyses demonstrated efficacy of mesalamine in IBS with diarrhea for global IBS symptoms (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99), but not patients with other predominant bowel habits or those with post-infection IBS. Adverse event rates were no higher with mesalamine (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.89-1.63) but were reported in only 5 trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Mesalamine may be modestly efficacious for global symptoms in IBS, particularly IBS with diarrhea, but quality of evidence was low. Adequately powered high quality RCTs of mesalamine in IBS are needed.",Goodoory VC; Tuteja AK; Black CJ; Ford AC,2024,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,22,2,243-251.e5,10.1016/j.cgh.2023.02.014,"Goodoory, V.

38199885,Acupuncture and moxibustion for irritable bowel syndrome: An umbrella systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS. Many systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS have been published in recent years, but their results are not entirely consistent.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the methodological, reporting, and evidence quality of systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic reviews of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS published before February 20, 2023 were searched in eight databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and China Biology Medicine. The keywords used for literature search were acupuncture, moxibustion, systematic review, meta-analysis, and irritable bowel syndrome.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Relevant information was independently extracted by two investigators. The A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020), and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) were used to evaluate the methodological quality, reporting quality and evidence quality, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 342 studies were retrieved and 15 systematic reviews were included. The results of AMSTAR 2 showed low methodological quality in 2 studies and very low methodological quality in the remaining 13 studies, with main issues being failure to register a protocol, incomplete search strategy, not providing a list of excluded studies, incomplete consideration of the risk of bias in the included studies, and a failure to assess the publication bias. The results of PRISMA 2020 showed seriously deficient reporting quality of 2 studies, somewhat deficient reporting quality of 12 studies, and relatively complete reporting quality of 1 study, with the main problems being lack of a complete search strategy, non-availability of a list of excluded studies with justification for their exclusion, not conducting heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses, not evaluating the credibility of the evidence, and not registering the protocol. The results of GRADE showed that the quality of the evidence is low or very low.
CONCLUSION: Most included systematic reviews interpreted findings to suggest that acupuncture and moxibustion have benefits for IBS. However, there is a need to improve the methodological, reporting and evidence quality of the systematic reviews. Larger, multicenter, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials and high-quality systematic reviews are required to obtain more robust evidence.

34114657,Systematic review and network meta-analysis: efficacy of licensed drugs for abdominal bloating in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation.,"BACKGROUND: Although bloating is a highly prevalent and troublesome symptom in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), treatment is empirical with no specific guidelines for its management.
AIM: To conduct a pairwise and network meta-analysis, using a frequentist approach, of Food and Drug Administration-licensed drugs for IBS-C comparing their efficacy for abdominal bloating as a specific endpoint.
METHODS: We searched the medical literature through December 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in IBS-C, with abdominal bloating reported as a dichotomous assessment. Efficacy of each drug was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their P-score.
RESULTS: We identified 13 eligible RCTs, containing 10 091 patients. Linaclotide 290 μg o.d., lubiprostone 8 μg b.d., tenapanor 50 mg b.d. and tegaserod 6 mg b.d. were all superior to placebo for abdominal bloating in patients with IBS-C, in both pairwise and the network meta-analyses. Linaclotide demonstrated the greatest improvement in abdominal bloating in both pairwise and network meta-analysis (RR of failure to achieve an improvement in abdominal bloating = 0.78; 95% CI 0.74-0.83, number needed to treat = 7, P-score 0.97). Indirect comparison revealed no significant differences between individual drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: We found all licensed drugs for IBS-C to be superior to placebo for abdominal bloating. Linaclotide appeared to be the most efficacious at relieving abdominal bloating. Further research is needed to assess long-term efficacy of these agents and to better understand the precise mechanism of improving bloating.",Nelson AD; Black CJ; Houghton LA; Lugo-Fagundo NS; Lacy BE; Ford AC,2021,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,54,2,98-108,10.1111/apt.16437,"Nelson, A.

37565634,Probiotics for the management of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and three-level meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Previous systematic reviews demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, these studies are either affected by the inclusion of insufficient trials or by the problem of dependent data across multiple outcomes, and an overall effect size has not been provided. We aimed to determine the effect of probiotics on IBS through a three-level meta-analysis and clarify potential effect moderators.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, screening for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the effect of probiotics on IBS. The primary outcome was the improvement in the severity of global IBS symptoms at the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the improvement in abdominal pain and the quality of life. The effect sizes of the probiotics were measured by using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled by a three-level meta-analysis model.
RESULTS: We included 72 RCTs in the analysis. The meta-analysis showed significantly better overall effect of probiotics than placebo on the global IBS symptoms (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.34, P <0.001), abdominal pain (SMD -0.89, 95% CI -1.29 to -0.5, P <0.001) and quality of life (SMD 0.99, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.54, P <0.001), respectively. Moderator analysis found that a treatment duration shorter than 4 weeks was associated with a larger effect size in all the outcomes, and Bacillus probiotics had better improvement on the abdominal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics had a short-term effect and a medium effect size on the global IBS symptoms. Treatment duration and types of probiotics affected the effect size of probiotics, and shorter durations and Bacillus probiotics were associated with better treatment effects.

32973596,Alexithymia and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Given the role of alexithymia-as the inability to identify, differentiate, and express emotions-in chronic and immune-mediated illness, this systematic review analyzed the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), mainly represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed throughout this systematic review of the literature published between 2015 and 2020 in indexed sources from PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Search terms for eligible studies were: ""Inflammatory bowel disease"" AND ""Alexithymia"" [Titles, Abstract, Keywords]. Inclusion criteria were: articles written and published in English from 2015 and up to April 2020, reporting relevant and empirical data on alexithymia and IBD. Results: The initial search identified 34 indexed scientific publications. After screening, we found that five publications met the established scientific inclusion criteria. Overall, the mean value of alexithymia ranged from 39 to 53.2 [Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) score], thus mostly falling in non-clinical range for alexithymia (≤51). Comparisons of alexithymia between patients with UC and CD highlighted that patients with CD showed externally oriented thinking and difficulties identifying feelings to a greater extent. Regarding comparisons with other samples or pathologies, patients with IBD were more alexithymic than healthy controls and less alexithymic than patients with major depressive disorder, but no difference was found when compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Then, regarding correlations with other variables, alexithymia was positively associated with anxiety and depression, as well as with psychopathological symptoms and somatic complaints. Conclusion: This systematic review suggests that patients with IBD cannot be generally considered alexithymic at a clinically relevant extent. However, their greater alexithymic levels and its associations with psychological variables and somatic distress may suggest a reactivity hypothesis, in which living with IBD may progressively lead to impaired emotion recognition over time. Specifically, the relationship between IBD and IBS should be further explored, paying deeper attention to the clinical psychological functioning of CD, as IBD requires more emotional challenges to patients.",Martino G; Caputo A; Schwarz P; Bellone F; Fries W; Quattropani MC; Vicario CM,2020,Frontiers in psychology,11,,1763,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01763,"Martino, G., Caputo, A., Schwarz, P., Bellone, F., Fries, W., Quattropani, M.

37346153,Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder in developed countries and reduces patients' quality of life, hinders their ability to work, and increases health care costs. A growing number of trials have demonstrated an aberrant gut microbiota composition in IBS, also known as 'gut dysbiosis'. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been suggested as a treatment for IBS.
AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of IBS.
METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science up to 24 October 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of FMT compared to placebo (including autologous FMT) in treating IBS. The primary outcome was the number of patients with improvements of symptoms measured using a validated, global IBS symptoms score. Secondary outcomes were changes in quality-of-life scores, non-serious and serious adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95%CI were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, as were the mean differences (MD) and 95%CI for continuous outcomes. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the trials. GRADE criteria were used to assess the overall quality of the evidence.
RESULTS: Eight RCTs (484 participants) were included in the review. FMT resulted in no significant benefit in IBS symptoms three months after treatment compared to placebo (RR 1.19, 95%CI: 0.68-2.10). Adverse events were reported in 97 participants in the FMT group and in 45 participants in the placebo group (RR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.15). One serious adverse event occurred in the FMT group and two in the placebo group (RR 0.42, 95%CI: 0.07-2.60). Endoscopic FMT delivery resulted in a significant improvement in symptoms, while capsules did not. FMT did not improve the quality of life of IBS patients but, instead, appeared to reduce it, albeit non significantly (MD -6.30, 95%CI: -13.39-0.79). The overall quality of the evidence was low due to moderate-high inconsistency, the small number of patients in the studies, and imprecision.
CONCLUSION: We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of FMT for IBS.

37711240,Characteristics and effectiveness of interventions to reduce cyberbullying: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: This paper presents the results from a systematic review on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce Cyberbullying (CB) as a function of their outcomes and main characteristics; and an analysis of the level of completeness to which the characteristics of these interventions are described.
METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ERIC and Psycinfo databases on February 14, 2022. In addition, relevant publications were hand searched for relevant studies. We considered interventions that provided data on CB prevalence changes in populations between primary school and college age.
RESULTS: In total, 111 studies were retained for further screening from 3,477 results. Following rigorous screening, 43 reports including 46 studies and information from 36 different interventions were included in our systematic review. Results shows that most of the interventions measuring reductions in global CB, cyberperpetration/victimization, cybervictimization and cyberperpetration were effective or partially effective. While the interventions measuring reductions in cyber-bystanding were not effective. Multicomponent interventions showed higher effectiveness than single-component interventions. After completion of the TIDieR check-list, included interventions were considered to offer an insufficient level of detail for a number of the analyzed items in relation to ""how well planned,"" ""intervention modifications"" and ""tailoring.""
CONCLUSION: Given the aforementioned, it is critical to increase the number of studies and the quality of interventions targeting CB and the level of detail of its description in order to obtain more robust outcomes about how to reduce its prevalence and facilitate the replication of the effective interventions.

35581170,Association between irritable bowel syndrome and micronutrients: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of gut brain interaction with a multifactorial etiology. Food trigger avoidance is common among individuals with IBS and exclusion diets are gaining popularity. However, recent guidelines on IBS management cautioned regarding the use of unsupervised dietary therapy with concerns of development of poor eating habits and even nutritional deficiencies. We aimed to review the available literature on the effect of habitual and exclusion diets on micronutrient status as well as the role of micronutrient supplementation in alleviating IBS symptoms.
METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science) were searched for articles that reported micronutrient data in patients with IBS. Serum micronutrient levels and dietary intake of micronutrients in patients with IBS were collected. The extracted data were tabulated and organized by micronutrient type to observe for trends.
RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were included in this systematic review (12 interventional and 14 observational studies). Studies showed that generally IBS subjects had lower levels of vitamin B2, vitamin D, calcium, and iron at baseline compared with non-IBS subjects. Studies also found that exclusion diets were associated with lower intake of micronutrients especially vitamin B1, B2, calcium, iron, and zinc. There was a lack of interventional studies on micronutrients.
CONCLUSION: Irritable bowel syndrome patients are at risk of developing multiple micronutrient deficiencies that may have both localized gastrointestinal as well as systemic effects. Dietary management of IBS patients should include a proper dietitian review to ensure nutritional adequacy where possible.",Bek S; Teo YN; Tan XH; Fan KHR; Siah KTH,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,8,1485-1497,10.1111/jgh.15891,"Bek, S., Teo, Y.

30996042,Efficacy of pharmacological therapies in patients with IBS with diarrhoea or mixed stool pattern: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Over half of patients with IBS have either diarrhoea (IBS-D) or a mixed stool pattern (IBS-M). The relative efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies is unclear in the absence of head-to-head trials. We conducted a network meta-analysis to resolve this uncertainty.
DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov through January 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of licenced pharmacological therapies (alosetron, eluxadoline, ramosetron and rifaximin) in adults with IBS-D or IBS-M. Trials included in the analysis reported a dichotomous assessment of overall response to therapy, and data were pooled using a random effects model. Efficacy and safety of all pharmacological therapies were reported as a pooled relative risk with 95% CIs to summarise the effect of each comparison tested. Treatments were ranked according to their p score.
RESULTS: We identified 18 eligible RCTs (seven alosetron, five ramosetron, two rifaximin and four eluxadoline), containing 9844 patients. All were superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS-D or IBS-M at 12 weeks, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoint for trials in IBS. Alosetron 1 mg twice daily was ranked first for efficacy, based on the FDA-recommended composite endpoint of improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency, effect on global symptoms of IBS and effect on stool consistency. Ramosetron 2.5μg once daily was ranked first for effect on abdominal pain. Total numbers of adverse events were significantly greater with alosetron 1 mg twice daily and ramosetron 2.5μg once daily, compared with placebo. Rifaximin 550 mg three times daily ranked first for safety. Constipation was significantly more common with all drugs, except rifaximin 550 mg three times daily.
CONCLUSION: In a network meta-analysis of RCTs of pharmacological therapies for IBS-D and IBS-M, we found all drugs to be superior to placebo, but alosetron and ramosetron appeared to be the most effective.",Black CJ; Burr NE; Camilleri M; Earnest DL; Quigley EM; Moayyedi P; Houghton LA; Ford AC,2020,Gut,69,1,74-82,10.1136/gutjnl-2018-318160,"Black, C.

37834010,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) poses a significant challenge due to its poorly understood pathogenesis, substantial morbidity, and often inadequate treatment outcomes. The role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in managing IBS symptoms remains inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of FMT in relieving symptoms in IBS patients. A thorough search was executed on PubMed/Medline and Embase databases until 14 June 2023, including all studies on FMT use in IBS patients. We examined the efficiency of FMT in reducing patients' symptoms overall and in particular subgroups, classified by placebo preparation, FMT preparation, frequency, and route of administration. Among 1015 identified studies, seven met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The overall symptomatology of FMT-treated IBS patients did not significantly differ from the control group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.39-2.5). Multiple doses of FMT compared with non-FMT placebo, or single-donor FMT therapy compared with autologous FMT placebo also showed no significant benefit (OR = 0.32, 95%CI (0.07-1.32), p = 0.11, and OR = 1.67, 95%CI (0.59-4.67), p = 0.32, respectively). However, a single dose of multiple-donor FMT administered via colonoscopy (lower gastrointestinal (GI) administration) significantly improved patient symptoms compared with autologous FMT placebo (OR = 2.54, 95%CI (1.20-5.37), p = 0.01, and OR = 2.2, 95%CI (1.20-4.03), p = 0.01, respectively). The studies included in the analysis showed a low risk of bias and no publication bias. In conclusion, lower GI administration of a single dose of multiple-donor FMT significantly alleviates patient complaints compared with the autologous FMT used as a placebo. The underlying mechanisms need to be better understood, and further experimental studies are desired to fill the current gaps.",Jamshidi P; Farsi Y; Nariman Z; Hatamnejad MR; Mohammadzadeh B; Akbarialiabad H; Nasiri MJ; Sechi LA,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,19,,10.3390/ijms241914562,"Jamshidi, P., Farsi, Y., Nariman, Z., Hatamnejad, M.

31912613,Intimate partner violence and perinatal health: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Physical, psychological and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) has been described in the literature as different types of IPV experienced by women during pregnancy all over the world.
OBJECTIVES: To review and summarise systematically the empirical evidence on the links between IPV during pregnancy and the perinatal health of mothers and fetuses/neonates.
SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, Nursing@ovid (Ovid) and LILACS were searched (2008-2018).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Observational studies that examined perinatal health outcomes (i.e. pre-term birth, low birthweight, miscarriage, perinatal death and premature rupture of membranes) in pregnant women exposed to IPV.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Information on study characteristics, type of IPV measured, study design, methodological quality and outcome variable extracted.
RESULTS: Fifty studies were included. Twenty-nine analysed undifferentiated IPV (n = 25 489), 34 included physical IPV (n = 7333), 22 analysed psychological IPV (n = 7833) and 18 examined sexual IPV (n = 2388). Fifteen studies were from Asia, 12 from North America and Oceania, and 12 from Central and South America. The studies examined the association between IPV and 39 different perinatal health outcomes. The most frequent outcomes reported were pre-term birth (50%), low birthweight (46%), miscarriage (30%), perinatal death (20%) and premature rupture of membranes (20%). A significant association with perinatal health outcomes was reported by 12 of the studies analysing undifferentiated IPV, 18 physical IPV, six psychological IPV and two sexual IPV.
CONCLUSIONS: The relation between IPV and perinatal health outcomes can be seen in different epidemiological designs and countries. In all, 39 different outcomes were identified and 29 were associated with IPV.

32004880,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Endometriosis and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are common conditions among young women of reproductive age. The etiologies to the diseases are uncertain, but multifactorial pathophysiology has been proposed for each of them. Many studies have examined the two conditions separately, but the literature on the associations between endometriosis and IBS is sparse. However, there is an increasing amount of research on how endometriosis patients are likely to also have a diagnosis of IBS. Furthermore, endometriosis shares several features with IBS, such as low-grade inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. This systematic review summarized published original articles in English that have compared associations between endometriosis and IBS. The inclusion criteria for articles in the review were: i) endometriosis was diagnosed by surgical methods, ii) gastrointestinal symptoms were examined in a structured manner and iii) IBS was diagnosed by Rome criteria. From the initial 254 publications identified on PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE, 13 fulfilled the criteria and could finally be included in the summary. The findings from the review showed that women diagnosed with endometriosis seem to have a twofold or threefold risk to also fulfill the criteria for IBS. The summary risk estimate of the four studies included in the meta-analysis was 2.39 (95 % confidence interval: 1.83-3.11). In women initially diagnosed with IBS, some studies reported a threefold risk of having an endometriosis diagnosis. Despite the strong associations reported between the two conditions, this review also revealed a gap in adjusting for factors that may have affected the expression of gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., phases of the menstrual cycle, medication and psychological aspects, which may have interpretation of the reviewed articles' results. The conclusion of this review is that there is a coexistence of gastrointestinal symptoms fulfilling the Rome criteria in patients with endometriosis, but it is uncertain whether there is a true comorbidity between endometriosis and IBS, or whether the gastrointestinal symptomatology in endometriosis depends on medication. Additionally, the adequacy of the Rome criteria to differentiate IBS from the shared symptomatology of other diseases with visceral hypersensitivity must be further evaluated.",Saidi K; Sharma S; Ohlsson B,2020,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",246,,99-105,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.01.031,"Saidi, K., Sharma, S., & Ohlsson, B.

38820411,Inflammatory biomarkers and perinatal depression: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 10 to 20% of pregnant women worldwide experience perinatal depression (PND), a depressive episode with onset during pregnancy or after childbirth. We performed a systematic review to identify, summarize and discuss studies on inflammatory biomarkers described in relation to PND.
METHOD: Inclusion criteria defined the selection of observational studies written in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese, that evaluate analytical levels of inflammatory molecules (protein levels) in biological fluids in women, with a diagnosis of depression using ICD/DSM diagnostic criteria or depressive symptoms assessed by standardized psychometric instruments, during pregnancy and/or postpartum. Case reports, experimental studies, reviews, qualitative analysis, meta-analysis, gray literature or replicated data were excluded. Three electronic databases were used for search (Pubmed, Web of Science and PsychInfo) and quality assessment of selected studies were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data extraction included study design; number of subjects; obstetric information; tools and timepoints of depression and inflammatory markers assessment.
RESULTS: 56 studies (sample size for cross-sectional and case-control studies ranging from 10 to 469; sample size for longitudinal studies ranging from 26 to 467), where the major aim was to analyze the association between depression and inflammatory biomarkers during pregnancy and postpartum period were included in this systematic review. Overall, the findings of our systematic review lend support to the hypothesis that several inflammatory markers may be associated with peripartum depressive symptoms. The associations were somewhat different looking at pregnancy compared to the delivery time-point and postpartum, and mainly referred to increased levels of IL-6, IL-8, CRP and TNF-α among depressed.
DISCUSSION: In summary, our systematic review findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that several inflammatory markers may correlate with peripartum depressive symptoms. However, our work also highlighted notable differences in the timing of biological sampling for inflammatory markers and in the methodologies used to assess depression during the perinatal period. Additionally, variations were observed in how inflammatory biomarkers and depression were approached, including their classification as exposure or outcome variables, and the timing of assessments. It is essential for future research to investigate the influence of biological fluids and the timing of assessments for both inflammatory biomarkers and depression to gain a deeper understanding of their association. This comprehensive exploration is pivotal for elucidating the intricate relationship between inflammation and perinatal depression.",Silva-Fernandes A; Conde A; Marques M; Caparros-Gonzalez RA; Fransson E; Mesquita AR; Figueiredo B; Skalkidou A,2024,PloS one,19,5,e0280612,10.1371/journal.pone.0280612,"Silva-Fernandes, A., Conde, A., Marques, M., Caparros-Gonzalez, R.

31913194,Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Case-Control Studies.,"INTRODUCTION: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and controls.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to December 2018 for studies reporting SIBO prevalence in patients with IBS. Prevalence rates, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SIBO in patients with IBS and controls were calculated.
RESULTS: We included 25 studies with 3,192 patients with IBS and 3,320 controls. SIBO prevalence in patients with IBS was significantly increased compared with controls (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 2.3-6.0). In studies using only healthy controls, the OR for SIBO in patients with IBS was 4.9 (95% CI 2.8-8.6). With breath testing, SIBO prevalence in patients with IBS was 35.5% (95% CI 33.6-37.4) vs 29.7% (95% CI 27.6-31.8) in controls. Culture-based studies yielded a SIBO prevalence of 13.9% (95% CI 11.5-16.4) in patients with IBS and 5.0% (95% CI 3.9-6.2) in controls with a cutoff value of 10 colony-forming units per milliliter vs 33.5% (95% CI 30.1-36.9) in patients with IBS and 8.2% (95% CI 6.8-9.6) in controls with a cutoff value of 10 colony-forming unit per milliliter, respectively. SIBO prevalence diagnosed by lactulose breath test is much greater in both patients with IBS (3.6-fold) and controls (7.6-fold) compared with glucose breath test. Similar difference is seen when lactulose breath test is compared with culture methods. OR for SIBO in patients with IBS-diarrhea compared with IBS-constipation was 1.86 (95% CI 1.83-2.8). Methane-positive breath tests were significantly more prevalent in IBS-constipation compared with IBS-diarrhea (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2). In patients with IBS, proton pump inhibitor was not associated with SIBO (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.5, P = 0.55).
DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a link between IBS and SIBO. However, the overall quality of the evidence is low. This is mainly due to substantial ""clinical heterogeneity"" due to lack of uniform selection criteria for cases and controls and limited sensitivity and specificity of the available diagnostic tests.",Shah A; Talley NJ; Jones M; Kendall BJ; Koloski N; Walker MM; Morrison M; Holtmann GJ,2020,The American journal of gastroenterology,115,2,190-201,10.14309/ajg.0000000000000504,"Shah, A., Talley, N.

37208218,Microbial composition across body sites in polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women, but the cause remains unclear. Recent evidence has linked microbial composition with PCOS; however, the results are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to gather current knowledge of the microbes across body sites (oral cavity, blood, vagina/cervix, gut) in women with PCOS, and meta-analyse the microbial diversity in PCOS. For this purpose, a systematic search using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus was carried out. After selection, 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies associated changes in the microbiome with PCOS, whereas heterogeneity of the studies in terms of ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and methodology, among other confounders, made it difficult to corroborate this relationship. In fact, 19 out of 34 of the studies were categorised as having high risk of bias when the quality assessment was conducted. Our meta-analysis on the gut microbiome of 14 studies demonstrated that women with PCOS possess significantly lower microbial alpha diversity compared with controls (SMD = -0.204; 95% CI -0.360 to -0.048; P = 0.010; I2 = 5.508, by Shannon Index), which may contribute to the development of PCOS.

34942583,Emotional stress responsivity of patients with IBS - a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of the gut-brain interaction characterized by abdominal discomfort and pain associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of structural abnormalities. Chronic psychological stress is considered a risk factor for the development of IBS. The multifactorial pathogenesis involves complex interactions between biological, psychological and social factors, yet the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature from the databases MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to assess stress responsivity of patients with IBS in comparison to healthy individuals, specifically focusing acute psychological stressors.
RESULTS: A total of 37 case-control studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Findings comprised subjective changes in emotion (k = 18) and of gastrointestinal symptoms (k = 8) as well as objective parameters of gastrointestinal motility (k = 10), autonomic nervous system (k = 23), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (k = 11), functional brain activity (k = 7) and immune system (k = 3). Mental stress was found to increase IBS-specific symptomatology and alter gastrointestinal motility. Some patients with IBS showed stress-induced emotional hyperresponsivity and different patterns of neural activation. Autonomic and endocrine stress responses depend on the type of stressor and showed no clear evidence of differential reactivity, partly due to confounding factors. Data on acute immunological changes remains sparse and requires further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests altered stress reactivity in patients with IBS however, it remains unclear whether it can be attributed to the syndrome itself or the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities.",Schaper SJ; Stengel A,2022,Journal of psychosomatic research,153,,110694,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110694,"Schaper, S.

34752585,Coping Strategies and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities. While psychosocial determinants were intently studied, coping strategies with stress used by IBS patients were never comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize the coping strategies used by IBS patients and to identify which tools are frequently used to measure coping strategies.
METHODS: According to PRISMA guidelines, we searched for articles indexed in PubMed, EBSCOhost, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. The search terms included: (coping OR coping strategies OR coping mechanism) AND (irritable bowel syndrome OR IBS). The initial search identified 756 articles. After applying all filters (human filters, excluding conference abstracts and conference papers), 96 studies remained. Finally, a total of 21 articles were included in this systematic review.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles using fifteen coping instruments and six measures of quality of life were found. One was interventional, one longitudinal, and the rest were cross-sectional studies. One study was qualitative, while the rest used quantitative measures. Emotion-focused coping was associated with worse psychological outcomes, while the effect of problem-focused coping was not regularly associated with better psychological outcomes. Catastrophizing was negatively associated with health-related quality of life. Psychological distress (anxiety, depression) was significantly related to the impairment of health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Patients with IBS cope in different ways when confronted with health and daily-life stressors. The maladaptive strategy of coping is associated with poor health-related quality of life and psychiatric comorbidities but methodological problems limit conclusions regarding the strength and nature of this association. Future research needs to focus on which strategies are most effective at reducing psychological distress in IBS patients.",David L; Fadgyas Stanculete M; Bolba AR; Chiaroni G; Barsan M; Popa SL,2021,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,30,4,485-494,10.15403/jgld-3937,"David, L., Fadgyas Stanculete, M., Bolba, A.

35101341,Vaccination coverage among migrants: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Migrants, a population vulnerable to communicable diseases, face multiple barriers in access to immunization programs. Individual studies suggest that they suffer immunization inequity compared to non-migrants, but the gap in vaccination has not been quantified. This systematic review assessed quantitatively the level of vaccination coverage among migrants, in comparison with non-migrants, collating the published literature.
METHODS: Review protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42021228061). A literature search without language restrictions was conducted in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from database inception to February 2021. This review included observational studies that provided the vaccination rates among migrant and non-migrant groups. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Data were synthesized pooling data from individual studies to generate summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using random effects model, assessing heterogeneity with I2 statistic and publication bias with funnel asymmetry analysis.
FINDINGS: There were 44 relevant studies (7,937,996 participants). Overall risk of bias was low in 13 (30%), moderate in 22 (50%) and high in 9 (20%) studies. Point estimates of individual ORs showed lower vaccination coverage among migrants in 36 of 39 meta-analyzable studies. Overall, the odds of vaccination coverage among migrants were lower compared to non-migrants (7,375,184 participants; summary OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.37-0.66; I2 99.9%). There was no funnel asymmetry.
INTERPRETATION: Migrants are half as often vaccinated compared to non-migrants.

DATA SOURCES: We retrieved records from Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library to identify studies published between January 2002 and October 2022.
REVIEW METHODS: Articles were independently assessed by 2 reviewers and verified by a third reviewer. Published cross-sectional studies, cohort/longitudinal studies, case series, and noncomparative cohort studies were considered eligible for inclusion. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to a registered protocol on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Selected studies were classified into 2 groups: epidemiological and genetic association studies. Relative frequencies and odds ratios (ORs) for each autoinflammatory/autoimmune disease or genetic marker reported to be associated with MD.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies from 6 countries met our inclusion criteria. Nine are epidemiological studies and 6 are genetic association studies. The epidemiological studies were used to perform 3 different meta-analyses. Airway allergic disease and autoimmune thyroid disease showed a significant association with MD (OR = 2.27 [2.08-2.48] and OR = 1.35 [1.25-1.46]); while rheumatoid arthritis did not (OR = 0.63 [0.28-1.41]). Other comorbidities also showed a significant association with MD like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vitiligo, fibromyalgia, arthritis, and psoriasis.
CONCLUSION: Epidemiological evidence supports an association between MD and immune-related disorders in European and Asian populations, with population-specific effects.

35086857,Meta-analysis and systematic review of the association between adverse childhood events and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by abdominal pain, bowel habits alterations, constipation, and/or diarrhea. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are events such as abuse and mental illness causing childhood trauma. Studies report higher prevalence of ACEs in patients with IBS with varied effect consistency and association strength. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate current literature, assess heterogeneity and research gaps in this relationship. A search across PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar with keywords ('childhood adversity' OR 'childhood trauma' OR 'adverse childhood events') AND ('irritable colon' OR 'irritable bowel syndrome') yielded 106 studies. A restricted maximum likelihood model of 15 chosen studies with 272,686 participants found the association between ACEs and IBS to be uncertain given the considerable heterogeneity (I2=93.58%, p<0.001). Objective reporting methods for ACE and IBS, study size, and study quality explained some heterogeneity. Twelve studies showed publication bias (Egger's test, p<0.001), which further weakened interpretation. Gender-stratified subanalysis of three studies found ACEs associated with IBS in females (pOR=2.20, 95% CI (1.13 to 4.29), I2=66.90%) with substantial heterogeneity, but no association in males (pOR=1.30, 95% CI (0.62 to 2.78)). This meta-analysis explores the current literature to understand the biopsychosocial perspective of IBS and ACEs' role as risk factors. However, the risk of publication and design/study quality biases substantiates the need for further research. If an association is confirmed, further mechanistic research and development of targeted psychological therapies may be warranted.",Joshee S; Lim L; Wybrecht A; Berriesford R; Riddle M,2022,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,70,6,1342-1351,10.1136/jim-2021-002109,"Joshee, S., Lim, L., Wybrecht, A., Berriesford, R., & Riddle, M.

40077681,Meat Consumption and Depression: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Several original studies have reported an inconsistent association between low meat consumption (e.g., vegetarian diets) and the risk of depression. The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between low meat consumption and depression, identifying possible sources of heterogeneity and the potential role of psychosocial variables. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines through a comprehensive search in Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsychInfo databases from inception to January 2024 (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42023405426). The exposures analyzed were (1) a meat-free diet and (2) a flexitarian (low-meat) diet. The outcome was depression. The meta-analysis included twenty longitudinal observational studies. Forest plots were designed, and heterogeneity was analyzed through I2 statistic and subgroup analyses. Publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and Egger's test. Results: The pooled overall analysis showed a protective association (HR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.59-0.89, I2 = 53.9%) between meat-free consumption and depression, which was consistent in the group of highest-quality studies. The main sources of heterogeneity identified were study quality, study design, year and country of publication, gender inequality in the country, and adjustment for certain variables (including social variables). The association between flexitarian diet and depression (HR: 0.90, 95%CI: 0.81-0.99, I2 = 58.9%) was not consistent between subgroups. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis show a consistent protective association between meat-free diets and depression and an inconclusive association regarding flexitarian diet. Primary studies analyzing psychosocial variables are needed to explain these results.",Luque-Martínez A; Ávila-Jiménez ÁF; Reinoso-Espín Á; Araújo-Jiménez MÁ; Martos-Salcedo CR; González-Domenech P; Jiménez-Fernández S; Martínez-Ruiz V; Cano-Ibáñez N; Rivera-Izquierdo M,2025,Nutrients,17,5,,10.3390/nu17050811,"Luque-Martínez, A., Ávila-Jiménez, Á.

36076616,Pharmacogenetics of siponimod: A systematic review.,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory neurological disease, and siponimod (Mayzent) is the first oral treatment option for adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We performed a systematic review of the pharmacogenetics of Siponimod, and we found that (430 C>T; rs1799853) and CYP2C9 * 3 (1075 A>C; rs1057910), both translated no-function alleles, have been related to a lower metabolism of siponimod by CYP2C9 enzyme. The FDA-approved drug label and EMA risk management plan for siponimod require testing patients for CYP2C9 genotype before treatment starts. The FDA drug label states that siponimod is contraindicated in patients carrying a CYP2C9 * 3/* 3 genotype, and a daily maintenance dose of 1 mg in patients with CYP2C9 * 1/* 3 and * 2/* 3 genotypes. The EMA reported the potential long-term safety implications in CYP2C9 poor metabolizer patients treated with this drug. Based on this systematic review we concluded that CYP2C9 SNPs influence on siponimod response might be stated by assessing not only CYP2C9 * 2 and CYP2C9 * 3 but other genetic variants resulting in CYP2C9 IM/PM status. CYP2C9 IM phenotype translated from the CYP2C9 * 2 genotype should be revised since it is contradictory compared to other CYP2C9 no-function alleles, and CYP2C9 * 2 might be excluded from PGx testing recommendation before treatment starts with siponimod since it is not translated into a therapeutic recommendation.",Díaz-Villamarín X; Piñar-Morales R; Barrero-Hernández FJ; Antúnez-Rodríguez A; Cabeza-Barrera J; Morón-Romero R,2022,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,153,,113536,10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113536,"Díaz-Villamarín, X., Piñar-Morales, R., Barrero-Hernández, F.

35396764,Vitamin D supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent and complex gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Observational studies have suggested a relationship between serum vitamin D levels and IBS symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation on IBS symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) measures.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by four authors independently, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus from the senior author. Continuous data were pooled with standardized mean difference (SMD) using the DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis by risk of bias and potentially ""predatory"" publication were performed as well.
RESULTS: A total of 685 patients across eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation significantly improved IBS symptom severity scale scores, with a SMD of -0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.47 to -0.07, P = 0.04, I2 = 91%). Improvements in IBS-QoL scores were also observed, albeit not statistically significant (SMD 0.54; 95% CI -0.34 to 1.41, P = 0.15, I2 = 87%). However, small sample sizes, a relatively young study population, limited ethnicities, and varied vitamin D dosing strategies across the studies were notable limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation could be part of our clinical armamentarium when managing IBS patients due to the potential efficacy and good safety profile. Further randomized, controlled trials are required to confirm the therapeutic effects.",Chong RIH; Yaow CYL; Loh CYL; Teoh SE; Masuda Y; Ng WK; Lim YL; Ng QX,2022,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,37,6,993-1003,10.1111/jgh.15852,"Chong, R.

DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis.
SETTING: Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
PARTICIPANTS: Original research evaluating patients, with or without the need for protective invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with a diagnosis of COVID-19, who developed atraumatic PNX or PNMD on admission or during hospital stay.
INTERVENTIONS: Data of interest were obtained from each article and analyzed and assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The risk of the variables of interest was assessed with data derived from studies including patients who developed atraumatic PNX or PNMD.
MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Mortality, mean ICU stay and mean PaO2/FiO2 at diagnosis.
RESULTS: Information was collected from 12 longitudinal studies. Data from a total of 4901 patients were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 1629 patients had an episode of atraumatic PNX and 253 patients had an episode of atraumatic PNMD. Despite the finding of significantly strong associations, the great heterogeneity between studies implies that the interpretation of results should be made with caution.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality among COVID-19 patients was higher in those who developed atraumatic PNX and/or PNMD compared to those who did not. The mean PaO2/FiO2 index was lower in patients who developed atraumatic PNX and/or PNMD.

38128150,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based telerehabilitation could be a valuable option for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, with the advantage of providing rehabilitation from anywhere. However, there is no solid and updated evidence demonstrating its effectiveness on relevant clinical and cost outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of internet-based telerehabilitation during the recovery of musculoskeletal disorders.
METHODS: Medline, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception to June 2023. Trials investigating the effects of internet-based telerehabilitation in any musculoskeletal disorder were selected. Nonoriginal articles and grey literature were excluded. Two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction. Random effect meta-analyses (standardized mean difference) and further sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: We selected 37 clinical trials (33 randomized and 4 non-randomized) and 5 health economics studies, which included a total of 4,288 participants. Telerehabilitation was more favourable than control treatments in improving all studied clinical outcomes, although the effectiveness varied depending on the type of musculoskeletal disorder. The standard mean differences (SMD) ranged from 0.24 to 0.91. For physical function, the primary outcome, superior effectiveness was found only in people with hip fractures (SMD, 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.34 to 1.41). The effects for joint replacement, osteoarthritis, and spine pain were similar to those of control treatments. However, the favourable outcomes for telerehabilitation became insignificant when compared specifically to face-to-face rehabilitation. Some results displayed publication bias and a lack of robustness, necessitating cautious interpretation. In terms of health economics studies, telerehabilitation was 89.55$ (95 % CI 4.6 to 174.5) cheaper per individual than conventional treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Telerehabilitation should be considered in the recovery process of musculoskeletal disorders when optimal face-to-face rehabilitation is not feasible. Moreover, telerehabilitation reduces costs and time.

33227554,Adults living with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): A qualitative systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: To consolidate existing qualitative studies which examined the experiences and needs of adults living with IBS, and to gather a holistic insight for future directions and avenues to support these adults.
METHODS: A qualitative systematic review was conducted and six databases were searched for qualitative studies, beginning from each database's inception to July 2020. The qualitative data were meta-synthesised and thematic analysis was adopted. Any discrepancies that arose were discussed between the reviewers until a consensus was reached throughout the process of data screening, selection, critical appraisal and synthesis.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies with a total of 299 adults diagnosed with IBS were included. Four themes were identified: (1) physical, psychological, and social consequences; (2) impact of IBS on working adults; (3) dealing with IBS; and (4) sources of support and support needs.
CONCLUSION: Future research across geographically diverse locations are needed to gather a thorough perspective of the experiences and needs of adults living with IBS. The development and evaluation of technology-based, trained peer-led volunteers, and interventions that adopt mindfulness, active coping strategies, cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance, and commitment therapy are needed.

38004138,Examining the Association between Coffee Intake and the Risk of Developing Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of brain-gut interaction with a significant impact on quality of life. Coffee is a widely consumed beverage with numerous bioactive compounds that have potential effects on human health and disease states. Current studies on the effect of regular coffee consumption on the risk of developing IBS symptoms have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether coffee intake is associated with developing IBS. A systematic literature search was performed in three electronic databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, from inception until 31 March 2023. All original studies reporting associations between coffee intake and IBS were considered for inclusion. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study, and estimates were pooled, and where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values were calculated. Eight studies comprising 432,022 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. Using a fixed-effects model, coffee drinkers (any intake) had a reduced likelihood of developing IBS compared to controls, with a pooled OR of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.84). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the estimates.

34049374,Postinfection Irritable Bowel Syndrome Following Clostridioides difficile Infection: A Systematic-review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) affects ~14% patients after acute bacterial enterocolitis.
AIM: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of PI-IBS following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).
METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through January 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing PI-IBS following CDI. Primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [MetaXL (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria-Rome vs. others, time of IBS diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing IBS and CDI treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I2>50%.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). Data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies. Pooled prevalence of PI-IBS was 21.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2%-35.7%), I2=96%. Common PI-IBS subtypes were diarrhea-predominant in 46.3% (50) patients, and mixed in 33.3% (36) patients. Subgroup analyses by IBS diagnostic criteria, time of IBS diagnosis or CDI treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all P>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. Funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 20% of patients develop PI-IBS after CDI. Factors such as diagnostic criteria for IBS and CDI treatment did not affect prevalence, though small numbers limit the confidence in these conclusions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar for studies published before January 2021. We evaluated the quality of studies using a specific method for systematic reviews addressing prevalence questions, designed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. We carried out meta-analyses and performed heterogeneity, subgroups, meta-regression, and small-study effects analyses.
RESULTS: Fifty-one studies (which recruited 6,815 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Our results reveal a high prevalence of depression (31.19%), anxiety (54.76%), and stress (41.10%) in oral lichen planus. Furthermore, OLP patients presented a significantly higher relative frequency than control group without OLP for depression (OR = 6.15, 95% CI = 2.73-13.89, p < 0.001), anxiety (OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 2.10-5.85, p < 0.001), and stress (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.48-8.94, p = 0.005), showing large effect sizes. Subgroups meta-analyses showed the relevance of the participation of psychologists and psychiatrists in the diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and stress in patients with OLP. Multivariable meta-regression analysis showed the importance of the comorbidity of depression-anxiety in patients with OLP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that patients with OLP suffer a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress, being more frequent than in general population.

Furthermore, a gluten-free diet (GFD) can positively influence IBS symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive online search for IBS related to CD, NCGS and GFD was made using the Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane databases. Results: Although a systematic screening for CD in IBS is not recommended, CD prevalence can be increased in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. On the other hand, IBS symptoms can be persistent in treated CD patients, and their prevalence tends to decrease on a GFD. IBS symptoms may overlap and be similar to those associated to nonceliac gluten and/or wheat sensitivity. Increased gut permeability could explain the gluten/wheat effects in IBS patients. Finally, a GFD could improve symptoms in a subgroup of IBS patients. Conclusions: The possible interplay between IBS and gluten-related disorders represents a scientifically and clinically challenging issue.

37897138,A systematic review and meta-analysis of diet and nutrient intake in adults with irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous individual and environmental factors including diet may play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear to what degree dietary intake is affected in individuals with IBS. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize dietary intake of adults with IBS and to compare dietary intake between adults with IBS and non-IBS controls.
METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched through February 2023 for clinical trials and observational studies measuring usual diet in adults with IBS. Pooled weighted averages were estimated for total energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient data. Mean differences (MD) in nutrient intake were estimated for adults with IBS versus non-IBS controls using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the inconsistency index (I2).
KEY RESULTS: Sixty-three full-text articles were included in the review of which 29 studies included both IBS and control subjects. Nutrients not meeting the recommended intake level for any dietary reference values in the IBS population were fiber and vitamin D. Meta-regression by female proportion was positively correlated with total fat intake and negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake. Comparisons between participants with IBS and controls showed significantly lower fiber intake in participants with IBS with high heterogeneity (MD: -1.8; 95% CI: -3.0, -0.6; I2 = 85%).
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: This review suggests that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS; however, overall dietary intake does not appear to be comprised. Causes and consequences of reduced fiber in IBS deserve further study. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that fiber and vitamin D intake is suboptimal in IBS. However, overall intake of other macro- and micronutrients does not appear to be compromised.

33110417,Systematic Review of Prevalence Studies and Familial Aggregation in Vestibular Migraine.,"Background: Vestibular migraine (VM) is complex disorder consisting of episodes of migraine and vertigo with an estimated prevalence of 1-3%. As migraine, it is considered that VM has genetic predisposition; however, evidence to support a genetic contribution has not been critically appraised. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to assess available evidence in scientific publications to determine the role of inheritance in VM. Methods: After performing the quality assessment of the retrieved records, 31 studies were included (24 epidemiological reports and 7 genetic association studies in families or case-control in candidate genes). We gathered data about prevalence of VM in different populations and in families, and also about the genetic findings reported. In addition, other variables were considered to assess the heritability of VM, such as the ancestry, the age of onset or the familial history of vertigo and migraine. Results: The estimated prevalence of VM was different between black (3.13%), white (2.64%) and Asian (1.07%) ethnicities. The reported prevalence of VM in migraine patients is higher in European countries (21%) than in Asian countries (10%). Moreover, the prevalence of the migraine-vertigo association in families is 4-10 times higher than the prevalence reported in the general population (sibling recurrence risk ratio λs = 4.31-10.42). We also found that the age of onset is lower in patients with simultaneous onset of symptoms and in those who have familial history for migraine and/or vertigo, suggesting anticipation. Although some genetic studies have reported few allelic variants associated to MV, replication studies are needed to validate these results. Conclusions: The available evidence to support heritability in VM is limited. Variability in prevalence depending on ethnicity and geographic location suggests a combined genetic and environmental contribution to VM.

35848156,Indoor Built Environment and Older Adults' Activity: A Systematic Review.,"Although the physical environment can influence people's activity, there are few knowledge syntheses for indoor environments and older adults' daily life routines. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed evidence to inform future research and practice. Inclusion criteria were studies with any research designs, across all years and languages focused on older adults 60 years of age or more, on physical activity/sedentary behaviour and the indoor environment. After searching five databases, two authors completed title/abstract and full-text screening. The last search was on December 19, 2020. We screened 1,367 citations, and included 23 studies situated in private or collective dwellings (e.g., assisted living). We identified physical activity-supportive indoor features across three domains: campus (e.g., amenities, pathways), building (e.g., area, floor level), and fixtures (e.g., elevators, hallways).

37529242,Burnout syndrome and work engagement in nursing staff: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A difficult and demanding work environment, such as that often experienced in healthcare, can provoke fatigue, anxiety, distress, and discomfort. This study considers factors that may influence levels of burnout and work engagement among nurses and seeks to determine the relationship between these conditions.
METHOD: A systematic scoping review was performed, in accordance with the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, based on data obtained from a search of the PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases carried out in 2022 using the search equation: ""work engagement AND nurs* AND burnout."" This search identified nine quantitative primary studies suitable for inclusion in our analysis.
RESULTS: Work overload, type of shift worked, and/or area of hospital service, among other elements, are all relevant to the development of burnout. This syndrome can be countered by social support and appropriate personal resources and values, which are all positively associated with work engagement. Our analysis revealed a significant correlation between work engagement and the different domains of burnout. The correlation effect size between burnout and work engagement was -0.46 (95% CI -0.58, -0.31), with p < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: Well-targeted interventions in the healthcare work environment can reduce burnout levels, strengthen work engagement, and enhance the quality of healthcare.",Vargas-Benítez MÁ; Izquierdo-Espín FJ; Castro-Martínez N; Gómez-Urquiza JL; Albendín-García L; Velando-Soriano A; Cañadas-De la Fuente GA,2023,Frontiers in medicine,10,,1125133,10.3389/fmed.2023.1125133,"Vargas-Benítez, M.

38479936,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disease characterized by abdominal pain, distension, and altered bowel habits. Probiotics may alleviate IBS symptoms, but clinical trials remain conflicting.
AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for IBS patients.
METHODS: We searched relevant trials in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 2000 to June 2023. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes. A risk ratio (RR) and a 95% CI were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies involving 3011 patients were obtained. The results demonstrated that probiotics are more effective than placebo in reducing global IBS symptoms improvement rate (RR = 1.401, 95% CI 1.182-1.662, P < 0.001) and quality of life scores (SMD = 0.286, 95% CI = 0.154-0.418, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that a shorter treatment time (less than eight weeks) could reduce distension scores (SMD = 0.197, 95% CI = 0.038-0.356, P = 0.015). High doses (daily dose of probiotics ≥ 10ˆ10) or multiple strains of probiotics exhibit beneficial effects on abdominal pain (SMD = 0.412, 95% CI = 0.112-0.711, P = 0.007; SMD = 0.590, 95% CI = 0.050-1.129, P = 0.032; respectively). However, there was no significant benefit on global symptom scores (SMD = 0.387, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.653, P = 0.004) with statistically high inter-study heterogeneity (I2 = 91.9%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, there was no significant inter-group difference in terms of adverse events frequency (RR = 0.997, 95% CI 0.845-1.177, P = 0.973).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective and safe for IBS patients. High doses or multiple probiotic strains seem preferable, but definite conclusions are challenging due to the high heterogeneity. Large-scale, well-designed, and rigorous trials are needed to confirm their effectiveness.",Yang R; Jiang J; Ouyang J; Zhao Y; Xi B,2024,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,60,,362-372,10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.02.025,"Yang, R., Jiang, J., Ouyang, J., Zhao, Y., & Xi, B.

37494961,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between polycystic ovary syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Research on the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients has gained significant momentum over the years. However, it remains unclear whether PCOS is related to a higher prevalence of IBS. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to fully study IBS correlation with PCOS.
METHODS: From inception until October 16th, 2022, all observational studies documenting IBS prevalence in PCOS patients were collected from the China national knowledge infrastructure(CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database(VIP), Wanfang database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. The quality of case-control studies was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Review Manager 5.3 was used to determine the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: 5 case-control studies involving 1268 individuals and one cross-sectional study involving 291 participants were included in our qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis was conducted based on five case-control studies. Four case-control studies involving 1063 participants showed a higher prevalence of IBS in PCOS This meta-analysis revealed an almost twice higher risk of IBS in comparison with controls (OR = 2.23, 95%CI:1.58-3.14, p < 0.001; I2=41%, p = 0.150). Four sensitivity analyses validated the consistency of the aggregated findings.

38503513,A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of turmeric in the treatment of digestive disorders.,"Turmeric has been gaining popularity as a treatment option for digestive disorders, although a rigorous synthesis of efficacy has not been conducted. This study aimed to summarize the evidence for the efficacy and safety of turmeric in the treatment of digestive disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcers. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, EMBASE, AMED, the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, and Dissertation Abstracts from inception to November 15, 2021. Dual independent screening of citations and full texts was conducted and studies meeting inclusion criteria were retained: randomized controlled trials (RCT) and comparative observational studies evaluating turmeric use in people of any age with one of the digestive disorders of interest. Extraction of relevant data and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to high heterogeneity. From 1136 citations screened, 26 eligible studies were retained. Most studies were assessed to have a high risk of bias, and many had methodological limitations. Descriptive summaries suggest that turmeric is safe, with possible efficacy in patients with IBD or IBS, but its effects were inconsistent for other conditions. The efficacy of turmeric in digestive disorders remains unclear due to the high risk of bias and methodological limitations of the included studies. Future studies should be designed to include larger sample sizes, use rigorous statistical methods, employ core outcome sets, and adhere to reporting guidance for RCTs of herbal interventions to facilitate more meaningful comparisons and robust conclusions.",Thavorn K; Wolfe D; Faust L; Shorr R; Akkawi M; Isaranuwatchai W; Klinger C; Chai-Adisaksopa C; Tanvejsilp P; Nochaiwong S; Straus SE; Hutton B,2024,Phytotherapy research : PTR,38,6,2687-2706,10.1002/ptr.8189,"Thavorn, K., Wolfe, D., Faust, L., Shorr, R., Akkawi, M., Isaranuwatchai, W., Klinger, C., Chai-Adisaksopa, C., Tanvejsilp, P., Nochaiwong, S., Straus, S.

38699957,A systematic review of the association between environmental risk factors and the development of irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with roots in genetic, immune, psychological, and dietary factors. Recently, the potential correlation between environmental exposures, such as air pollution, and IBS has gained attention. This review aimed to systematically examine existing studies on environmental factors associated with IBS, elucidating this interplay and guiding future research.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from database inception to October 10, 2023, using the keywords ""Irritable Bowel"" or IBS or ""Irritable Colon"" or ""Mucous Colitis"" or ""Spastic Colitis"" or ""Spastic Colon"" AND ""environment* exposure*"". Studies were included if they were original, published in English, described defined environmental exposure(s), and had documented diagnosis of IBS. For the purposes of this review, articles reporting physical (e.g. radiation and climate change), biological (e.g. bacteria and viruses), and chemical (e.g. harmful gases) exposures were included while psychological and dietary factors, which have been reviewed in detail elsewhere, are outside of the scope.
RESULTS: A total of seven studies focusing on air quality, microbial exposure, and other environmental factors were reviewed. Studies highlighted a potential association between air pollutants and increased IBS incidence. Microbial exposure, post-natural disaster or due to poor sanitation, was linked to IBS development and gut dysbiosis. Other exposures, such as early pet ownership, were also associated with IBS risk.
CONCLUSION: Existing research demonstrates an epidemiologic relationship between environmental exposures and the development of IBS. Further research is needed to understand these associations.",Ng QX; Yaow CYL; Moo JR; Koo SWK; Loo EXL; Siah KTH,2024,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,39,9,1780-1787,10.1111/jgh.16587,"Ng, Q.

34547858,The association between irritable bowel syndrome and ischemic colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have suggested an association between ischemic colitis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) although the results were inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to comprehensively examine the association between IBS and ischemic colitis by identifying all available cohort and case-control studies and combining their effect estimates together.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: EMBASE, MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were systematically reviewed up to June 2020. Eligible study had to be either cohort or case-control studies that evaluated whether patients with IBS have a higher risk of ischemic colitis than individuals without IBS. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The systematic review identified three cohort and eight case-control studies. The pooled analysis found a significantly higher risk of ischemic colitis among patient with IBS with the pooled odds ratio of 2.50 (95% CI, 2.00-3.14; I2 57%). Funnel plot was relatively symmetric and was not suggestive of presence of publication bias.

36573039,Factors influencing rectal hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A frequent, although not universal, feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is heightened sensitivity to mechanical stimulation of the rectum, termed rectal hypersensitivity (RH). Differences in RH-based on sex, IBS subtype, IBS diagnostic criteria and age of population studied are incompletely understood. We aimed to determine whether IBS population had lower pain thresholds than healthy controls.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1970-2021). Prospective studies that compared pain/discomfort thresholds to mechanical rectal stimuli in IBS and healthy controls were included. Data were pooled for meta-analyses and effect sizes were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CIs).
RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 809 studies of which 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. Reduced rectal pain thresholds was more common in IBS patients compared to healthy controls with an effect size of 1.00 95% CIs (0.77-1.24) (p < 0.0001) (I2 = 78.6%). The pediatric IBS population had lower pain thresholds than adult IBS populations (p = 0.05) but no difference based on IBS diagnostic criteria, subtype or sex.
CONCLUSION & INFERENCES: The results suggest that reduced rectal pain threshold to experimental stimulation is far more common in IBS patients than healthy controls. Further research is required to understand the pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of rectal sensitivity such as its role in measuring response to treatment and prognosis in IBS.",Roberts C; Albusoda A; Farmer AD; Aziz Q,2023,Neurogastroenterology and motility,35,4,e14515,10.1111/nmo.14515,"Roberts, C., Albusoda, A., Farmer, A.

36589968,Clinical evidence of acupuncture and moxibustion for irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture and moxibustion have been widely used in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). But the evidence that acupuncture and moxibustion for IBS reduction of symptom severity and abdominal pain, and improvement of quality of life is scarce.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, China Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed), and unpublished sources were searched from inception until June 30, 2022. The quality of RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. The strength of the evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system (GRADE). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to determine whether the participants in the included trials had reached optimal information size and whether the cumulative data was adequately powered to evaluate outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 31 RCTs were included. Acupuncture helped reduce the severity of symptoms more than pharmaceutical drugs (MD, -35.45; 95% CI, -48.21 to -22.68; I 2 = 71%). TSA showed the cumulative Z score crossed O'Brien-Fleming alpha-spending significance boundaries. Acupuncture wasn't associated with symptom severity reduction (SMD, 0.03, 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.31, I 2 = 46%), but exhibited therapeutic benefits on abdominal pain (SMD, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.01; I 2 = 8%) compared to sham acupuncture. Moxibustion show therapeutic benefits compared to sham moxibustion on symptom severity (SMD, -3.46, 95% CI, -5.66 to -1.27, I 2 = 95%) and abdominal pain (SMD, -2.74, 95% CI, -4.81 to -0.67, I 2 = 96%). Acupuncture (SMD, -0.46; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.24; I 2 = 47%) and the combination of acupuncture and moxibustion (SMD, -2.00; 95% CI, -3.04 to -0.96; I 2 = 90%) showed more benefit for abdominal pain compared to pharmacological medications as well as shams. Acupuncture (MD, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.46-7.67; I 2 = 79%) and moxibustion (MD, 6.97; 95% CI, 5.78-8.16; I 2 = 21%) were more likely to improve quality of life than pharmaceutical drugs.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture and/or moxibustion are beneficial for symptom severity, abdominal pain and quality of life in IBS. However, in sham control trials, acupuncture hasn't exhibited robust and stable evidence, and moxibustion's results show great heterogeneity. Hence, more rigorous sham control trials of acupuncture or moxibustion are necessary.

34470728,Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting bisoprolol response.,"β-blockers are commonly prescribed to treat multiple cardiovascular (CV) diseases, but, frequently, adverse drug reactions and intolerance limit their use in clinical practice. Interindividual variability in response to β-blockers may be explained by genetic differences. In fact, pharmacogenetic interactions for some of these drugs have been widely studied, such as metoprolol. But studies that explore genetic variants affecting bisoprolol response are inconclusive, limited or confusing because of mixed results with other β-Blockers, different genetic polymorphisms observed, endpoint studied etc. Because of this, we performed a systematic review in order to find relevant genetic variants affecting bisoprolol response. We have found genetic polymorphism in several genes, but most of the studies focused in ADRB variants. The ADRB1 Arg389Gly (rs1801253) was the most studied genetic polymorphism and it seems to influence the response to bisoprolol, although studies are inconclusive. Even, we performed a meta-analysis about its influence on systolic/diastolic blood pressure in patients treated with bisoprolol, but this did not show statistically significant results. In conclusion, many genetic polymorphisms have been assessed about their influence on patients ́ response to bisoprolol and the ADRB1 Arg389Gly (rs1801253) seems the most relevant genetic polymorphism in this regard but results have not been confirmed with a meta-analysis. Our results support the need of further studies about the impact of genetic variants on bisoprolol response, considering different genetic polymorphisms and conducting single and multiple SNPs analysis, including other clinical parameters related to bisoprolol response in a multivariate study.",Castaño-Amores C; Díaz-Villamarín X; Pérez-Gutiérrez AM; Antúnez-Rodríguez A; Pozo-Agundo A; Moreno-Escobar E; Sánchez-Ramos JG; Martínez-González LJ; Dávila-Fajardo CL,2021,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,142,,112069,10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112069,"Castaño-Amores, C., Díaz-Villamarín, X., Pérez-Gutiérrez, A.

39047023,Depression in nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The pandemic meant a change in academic approach. This had an impact on the mental health of students, leading to, among other problems, depressive disorders. The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence and factors that favoured the development of depression in nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review with meta-analysis of prevalence was conducted in October 2023, using Pubmed, CINAHL and Scopus as the data sources used for the search. This review followed the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Search equation was: ""(undergraduate nurses OR nursing students) AND depression AND (COVID-19 OR Sars-CoV-2)"". The final set of articles was N = 12. Quantitative primary studies using anonymous scales and surveys to assess the prevalence of depression in nursing students in the last 3 years were included. Studies show a high prevalence of depression among young university students with figures above 50%. The total sample of students in the meta-analysis was n = 4,479 with a prevalence value of 32% (CI95% 22%-42%). Affected students are characterised by young, female students. Concerns included generalised academic uncertainty, social isolation, work overload, fear of contagion and concern about teaching delivery. Coping mechanisms were generally resilience, spiritual support, laughter therapy, seeking information about COVID-19 and eating food. In conclusion, students, especially female students, are at high risk of depression due to social isolation. In addition, coping techniques were inadequate and future strategies to prevent this situation should be considered.",Quesada-Puga C; Cañadas GR; Gómez-Urquiza JL; Aguayo-Estremera R; Ortega-Campos E; Romero-Béjar JL; Cañadas-De la Fuente GA,2024,PloS one,19,7,e0304900,10.1371/journal.pone.0304900,"Quesada-Puga, C., Cañadas, G.

37233510,Efficacy and Security of Tetrodotoxin in the Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pharmacological treatment of cancer-related pain is unsatisfactory. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) has shown analgesia in preclinical models and clinical trials, but its clinical efficacy and safety have not been quantified. For this reason, our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical evidence that was available. A systematic literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 1 March 2023 in order to identify published clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and security of TTX in patients with cancer-related pain, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Five articles were selected, three of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The number of responders to the primary outcome (≥30% improvement in the mean pain intensity) and those suffering adverse events in the intervention and placebo groups were used to calculate effect sizes using the log odds ratio. The meta-analysis showed that TTX significantly increased the number of responders (mean = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.19-1.16, p = 0.0065) and the number of patients suffering non-severe adverse events (mean = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.31-1.95, p = 0.0068). However, TTX did not increase the risk of suffering serious adverse events (mean = 0.75; 95% CI: -0.43-1.93, p = 0.2154). In conclusion, TTX showed robust analgesic efficacy but also increased the risk of suffering non-severe adverse events. These results should be confirmed in further clinical trials with higher numbers of patients.",Huerta MÁ; de la Nava J; Artacho-Cordón A; Nieto FR,2023,Marine drugs,21,5,,10.3390/md21050316,"Huerta, M.

Efficacy and safety of probiotic fungi were re-evaluated. Continuous data were pooled to obtain standardised difference in means (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval. The search strategy identified 120 articles of which 7 trial assessing 883 subjects were included in the analysis. Systematic data support that Saccharomyces helps to relieve abdominal pain/discomfort (SMD = -0.205, P = 0.005), and presented potential improvements on psychological outcomes, stool form for IBS patients. It is hard to demonstrate favourable effects on other symptoms (including distension, mucus passage, sense of incomplete evacuation, urgency, straining). The incidence of mild complications ranged from 0 to 51.4%, but no serious complications were observed in the included trials. Therefore, the partial response and the relative safe of probiotic fungi for IBS treatment have been demonstrated from the existing trials. However, it is premature to eventually declare the practical effects of probiotic fungi. Conducting more high-quality and large-scale trials and real-world studies, or even developing new fungal strains, is still necessary.",Qing Q; Chen Y; Zheng DK; Sun ML; Xie Y; Zhang SH,2023,Beneficial microbes,14,4,303-315,10.1163/18762891-20220134,"Qing, Q., Chen, Y., Zheng, D.

38892659,Changes in Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids in IBS Patients and Effects of Different Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"CONTEXT: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the results are conflicting.
OBJECTIVE: Here, a systematic review of case-control studies detecting fecal SCFAs in IBS patients compared with healthy controls (HCs) and self-controlled studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating fecal SCFA alterations after interventions were identified from several databases.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) identified 21 studies published before 24 February 2023. Data extractions: Three independent reviewers completed the relevant data extraction.
DATA ANALYSIS: It was found that the fecal propionate concentration in IBS patients was significantly higher than that in HCs, while the acetate proportion was significantly lower. Low-FODMAP diets significantly reduced the fecal propionate concentration in the IBS patients while fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic administration did not significantly change the fecal propionate concentration or acetate proportion.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the fecal propionate concentration and acetate proportion could be used as biomarkers for IBS diagnosis. A low-FODMAP diet intervention could potentially serve as a treatment for IBS while FMT and probiotic administration need more robust trials.",Ju X; Jiang Z; Ma J; Yang D,2024,Nutrients,16,11,,10.3390/nu16111727,"Ju, X., Jiang, Z., Ma, J., & Yang, D.

32008157,The association between irritable bowel syndrome and osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could be a risk factor for osteoporosis although the evidence is still limited. The current study aimed to comprehensively examine the risk of osteoporosis among patients with IBS using systematic review and meta-analysis technique.
METHODOLOGY: Literature search was independently conducted by two investigators using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar database up to October 2019. Eligible study must evaluate whether patients with IBS have a higher risk of osteoporosis and/or osteoporotic fracture. It could be either cross-sectional study, case-control study, or cohort study. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
RESULTS: Of the 320 articles identified from the three databases, four cohort and one cross-sectional study with 526,633 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. All five studies investigated the risk of osteoporosis among patients with IBS, and the pooled analysis found that patients with IBS had a significantly higher risk of osteoporosis than individuals without IBS with the pooled risk ratio of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.04-3.64; I2 100%). Sensitivity analysis including only cohort studies found a lower RR (pooled RR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.39-1.72) with a lower I2 (59%). Three studies investigated the risk of osteoporotic fracture, and the pooled analysis found that patients with IBS also had a higher risk of osteoporotic fracture than individuals without IBS with the pooled risk ratio of 1.58 although statistical significance was not reached (95% CI, 0.95-2.62; I2 99%). Sensitivity analysis including only cohort studies found a lower RR (pooled RR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20-1.39) with a dramatically lower I2 (0%). Limitations included high heterogeneity and reliance on diagnostic codes.
CONCLUSION: A significantly increased risk of osteoporosis among IBS patients was observed in this study. Early intervention to prevent the development of osteoporosis, such as weight-bearing exercise, adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium, and early screening for osteoporosis, may be beneficial to these patients although further studies are still required to confirm the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach.",Wongtrakul W; Charoenngam N; Ungprasert P,2020,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,31,6,1049-1057,10.1007/s00198-020-05318-y,"Wongtrakul, W., Charoenngam, N., & Ungprasert, P.

While traditionally considered to be commensal bacteria, there are scattered case reports and case series of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in CS and reports of colonic polyps with adherent spirochetes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the association between CS and GI symptoms and conditions including the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and colonic polyps. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed using specific keywords for CS and GI disease. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Of 75 studies identified in the search, 8 case-control studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis and 67 case series studies met the inclusion criteria for pooled prevalence analysis. CS was significantly associated with diarrhea (n = 141/127, cases/controls, OR: 4.19, 95% CI: 1.72-10.21, P = 0.002) and abdominal pain (n = 64/65, OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1.43-9.35, P = 0.007). CS cases were significantly more likely to have Rome III-diagnosed IBS (n = 79/48, OR: 3.84, 95% CI: 1.44-10.20, P = 0.007), but not colonic polyps (n = 127/843, OR: 8.78, 95% CI: 0.75-103.36, P = 0.084). In conclusion, we found evidence of associations between CS and both diarrhea and IBS, but not colonic polyps.

36476659,A comprehensive systematic review of colorectal cancer screening clinical practices guidelines and consensus statements.,"High-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and consensus statements (CSs) are essential for evidence-based medicine. The purpose of this systematic review was to appraise the quality and reporting of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening CPGs and CSs. After prospective registration (Prospero no: CRD42021286156), a systematic review searched CRC guidances in duplicate without language restrictions in ten databases, 20 society websites, and grey literature from 2018 to 2021. We appraised quality with AGREE II (% of maximum score) and reporting with RIGHT (% of total 35 items) tools. Twenty-four CPGs and 5 CSs were analysed. The median overall quality and reporting were 54.0% (IQR 45.7-75.0) and 42.0% (IQR 31.4-68.6). The applicability had low quality (AGREE II score <50%) in 83% of guidances (24/29). Recommendations and conflict of interest were low-reported (RIGHT score <50%) in 62% guidances (18/29) and 69% (20/29). CPGs that deployed systematic reviews had better quality and reporting than CSs (AGREE: 68.5% vs. 35.5%; p = 0.001; RIGHT: 74.6% vs. 41.4%; p = 0.001).

37772692,"Efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.","Introduction. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects the quality of life of numerous people worldwide.Gap statement. The therapeutic role of gut microbiota modulation in IBS remains controversial.Aim. We aimed to assess the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics in patients with IBS.Methodology. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 August 2023, to identify the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics among patients with IBS. Pooled analyses of the effects of probiotics in relieving IBS symptoms were calculated using a random-effects model. Further subgroup analyses were performed by different genera, doses and duration of treatment.Results. Our final analysis included 52 trials involving 6289 IBS patients. Probiotics significantly increased the overall response rate (RR:1.64; P<0.00001), subjective relief rate (RR:1.50; P=0.0002) and abdominal pain relief rate (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). As for specific genera, mixed probiotics (RR:1.41; P=0.0001), Bifidobacterium (RR:1.76; P<0.00001), Lactobacillus (RR:1.97; P=0.0004) and Saccharomyces (RR:1.31; P=0.0004) markedly relieved IBS symptoms. Mixed probiotics (RR:1.31; P=0.005), Lactobacillus (RR:2.22; P=0.04) and Bifidobacterium (RR:1.62; P<0.0001) elevated patients' subjective relief rate. Besides, probiotics effectively relieved the abdominal pain in IBS patients (RR:1.69; P<0.00001). Probiotics appeared to show a remarkable beneficial role at a dose of 109 c.f.u./day or above (RR:1.662; P<0.0001) and started to work at 4 weeks (RR 1.72; P<0.00001). Efficacy of prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS remained uncertain, due to the deficiency of available RCTs.Conclusions. Probiotics have a therapeutic role in IBS. However, the effect of different probiotics varies. The minimal effective dose of probiotics may be 109 c.f.u./day. With appropriate probiotic formula, the therapeutic effect can occur at 4 weeks. These data provide a basis for further research on the optimal probiotic therapy in IBS.",Zhang WX; Shi LB; Zhou MS; Wu J; Shi HY,2023,Journal of medical microbiology,72,9,,10.1099/jmm.0.001758,"Zhang, W.

31898645,Efficacy and safety of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional bowel disorder and the evidence shows most drug therapies in the treatment of IBS are weak. Recently, some studies showed probiotics may have a positive effect in IBS and they are widely used to improve the symptom of IBS, which indicate probiotics may play an important role in the treatment of IBS. However, the exact effectiveness and safety of probiotics are largely unknown. This systematic review focuses on identifying the efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of IBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data sources were searched up to February 2019. Databases included MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Embase. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics including complex or individual probiotics with placebo or no therapy were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of all RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias and Jadad scale. Outcomes included symptom-relevant and patient-relevant characteristics, such as symptom relief, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, quality of life, and adverse event.
RESULTS: This review includes 28 studies with a total of 3606 participants. Particular combinations of probiotics, or specific species and strains, showed probiotics have beneficial effect on overall IBS symptoms (22 studies, n = 3144, RR of improvement in overall IBS symptoms = 1.5, CI 1.23 to 1.83) or overall IBS symptom and abdominal pain scores (18 studies, n = 2766, SMD = -0.31, CI -0.45 to -0.17). In addition, adverse events were not significantly higher with probiotics (8 studies, n = 923, RR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.85-1.31). However, there was no significant benefit on individual IBS symptom scores and quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows particular combinations, species or strains of probiotics are effective for overall IBS symptoms. However, it is hard to derive a definite conclusion due to high heterogeneity and unclear risk of bias of some trials. Large well-designed and rigorous trials are warranted.",Sun JR; Kong CF; Qu XK; Deng C; Lou YN; Jia LQ,2020,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,26,2,66-77,10.4103/sjg.SJG_384_19,"Sun, J.

39255999,Associations of occupational and leisure-time physical activity with all-cause mortality: an individual participant data meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Health effects of different physical activity domains (ie, during leisure time, work and transport) are generally considered positive. Using Active Worker consortium data, we assessed independent associations of occupational and leisure-time physical activity (OPA and LTPA) with all-cause mortality.
DESIGN: Two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCE: Published and unpublished cohort study data.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Working participants aged 18-65 years.
METHODS: After data harmonisation, we assessed associations of OPA and LTPA with all-cause mortality. In stage 1, we analysed data from each study separately using Cox survival regression, and in stage 2, we pooled individual study findings with random-effects modelling.
RESULTS: In 22 studies with up to 590 497 participants from 11 countries, during a mean follow-up of 23.1 (SD: 6.8) years, 99 743 (16%) participants died. Adjusted for LTPA, body mass index, age, smoking and education level, summary (ie, stage 2) hazard ration (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for low, moderate and high OPA among men (n=2 96 134) were 1.01 (0.99 to 1.03), 1.05 (1.01 to 1.10) and 1.12 (1.03 to 1.23), respectively. For women (n=2 94 364), HRs (95% CI) were 0.98 (0.92 to 1.04), 0.96 (0.92 to 1.00) and 0.97 (0.86 to 1.10), respectively. In contrast, higher levels of LTPA were inversely associated with mortality for both genders. For example, for women HR for low, moderate and high compared with sedentary LTPA were 0.85 (0.81 to 0.89), 0.78 (0.74 to 0.81) and 0.75 (0.65 to 0.88), respectively. Effects were attenuated when adjusting for income (although data on income were available from only 9 and 6 studies, for men and women, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that OPA may not result in the same beneficial health effects as LTPA.",Coenen P; Huysmans MA; Holtermann A; Troiano RP; Mork PJ; Krokstad S; Clays E; Cillekens B; De Bacquer D; Aadahl M; Kårhus LL; Sjøl A; Andersen LB; Kauhanen J; Voutilainen A; Pulsford RM; Stamatakis E; Goldbourt U; Peters A; Thorand B; Rosengren A; Björck L; Sprow K; Franzon K; Rodriguez-Barranco M; Luján-Barroso L; Knutsson A; Alfredsson L; Bahls M; Ittermann T; Kluttig A; Hassan L; Wanner M; Bopp M; Marott JL; Schnohr P; Nordestgaard BG; Dalene KE; Ekelund U; Clausen J; Jensen MT; Petersen CB; Krause N; Twisk J; Mechelen WV; van der Beek AJ,2024,British journal of sports medicine,58,24,1527-1538,10.1136/bjsports-2024-108117,"Coenen, P., Huysmans, M.

37352901,A systematic review on machine learning approaches in the diagnosis and prognosis of rare genetic diseases.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of rare genetic diseases is often challenging due to the complexity of the genetic underpinnings of these conditions and the limited availability of diagnostic tools. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis by analyzing large amounts of genomic data and identifying complex multiallelic patterns that may be associated with specific diseases. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify the methodological trends and the ML application areas in rare genetic diseases.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature following the PRISMA guidelines to search studies that used ML approaches to enhance the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. Studies that used DNA-based sequencing data and a variety of ML algorithms were included, summarized, and analyzed using bibliometric methods, visualization tools, and a feature co-occurrence analysis.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria. We found that exome sequencing was the most frequently used sequencing technology (59%), and rare neoplastic diseases were the most prevalent disease scenario (59%). In rare neoplasms, the most frequent applications of ML models were the differential diagnosis or stratification of patients (38.5%) and the identification of somatic mutations (30.8%). In other rare diseases, the most frequent goals were the prioritization of rare variants or genes (55.5%) and the identification of biallelic or digenic inheritance (33.3%). The most employed method was the random forest algorithm (54.5%). In addition, the features of the datasets needed for training these algorithms were distinctive depending on the goal pursued, including the mutational load in each gene for the differential diagnosis of patients, or the combination of genotype features and sequence-derived features (such as GC-content) for the identification of somatic mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: ML algorithms based on sequencing data are mainly used for the diagnosis of rare neoplastic diseases, with random forest being the most common approach. We identified key features in the datasets used for training these ML models according to the objective pursued. These features can support the development of future ML models in the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases.",Roman-Naranjo P; Parra-Perez AM; Lopez-Escamez JA,2023,Journal of biomedical informatics,143,,104429,10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104429,"Roman-Naranjo, P., Parra-Perez, A.

32317962,Efficacy and Safety of Probiotics in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disease. Evidence has suggested that probiotics may benefit IBS symptoms. However, clinical trials remain conflicting.
AIMS: To implement a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials regarding the efficacy and safety of probiotics for IBS patients.
METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in Medline(1966 to Jan 2019), Embase(1974 to Jan 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(up to Jan 2019), the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register(up to Jan 2019), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database(1978 to Jan 2019). Risk ratio (RR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were calculated for continuous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 59 studies, including 6,761 patients, were obtained. The RR of the improvement or response with probiotics versus placebo was 1.52 (95% CI 1.32-1.76), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 71%, P < 0.001). The SMD of Probiotics in improving global IBS symptoms vs. Placebo was -1.8(95% CI -0.30 to -0.06), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 65%, P < 0.001). It was impossible to draw a determinate conclusion. However, there were differences in subgroup analyses of probiotics type, dose, treatment duration, and geographic position. Probiotics seem to be safe by the analysis of adverse events(RR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.92-1.24; I2 = 0, P = 0.83).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics are effective and safe for IBS patients. Single probiotics with a higher dose (daily dose of probiotics ≥1010) and shorter duration (< 8 weeks) seem to be a better choice, but it still needs more trials to prove it.",Li B; Liang L; Deng H; Guo J; Shu H; Zhang L,2020,Frontiers in pharmacology,11,,332,10.3389/fphar.2020.00332,"Li, B., Liang, L., Deng, H., Guo, J., Shu, H., & Zhang, L.

37222050,Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) negatively affect the quality of life. Some previous studies found that H. pylori infection should be positively associated with the risk of IBS, but others did not. The present study aims to clarify this association, and to further analyse whether H. pylori treatment can improve IBS symptoms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal and Wanfang databases were searched. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model. The pooled odds ratios (ORs)/risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% CIs were calculated. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics. Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Thirty-one studies with 21 867 individuals were included. Meta-analysis of 27 studies found that patients with IBS had a significantly higher risk of H. pylori infection than those without (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.18; p < 0.001). The heterogeneity was statistically significant (I2 = 85%; p < 0.001). Meta-regression analyses indicated that study design and diagnostic criteria of IBS might be the potential sources of heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of eight studies demonstrated that H. pylori eradication treatment had a higher improvement rate of IBS symptoms (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39; p < 0.001). The heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 32%; p = 0.170). Meta-analysis of four studies also demonstrated that successful H. pylori eradication had a higher improvement rate of IBS symptoms (RR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.53; p = 0.040). The heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 1%; p = 0.390).
CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of IBS. H. pylori eradication treatment can improve IBS symptoms.",Wang C; Yin Y; Wang L; Guo X; Liu L; Qi X,2023,Postgraduate medical journal,99,1169,166-175,10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-141127,"Wang, C., Yin, Y., Wang, L., Guo, X., Liu, L., & Qi, X.

35911986,Effects and Mechanisms of Acupuncture on Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction with challenging treatment. According to evidence-based studies, acupuncture is likely to be a promising therapy and subservient adjunct for IBS. Mechanism study of acupuncture based on related clinical trials of high quality, nevertheless, is still vacant.
AIM: This study aims to assess the results and qualities of current clinical evidence and conclude the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic effects of acupuncture on IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D).
METHODS: Literature from four databases, namely, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science, was systematically searched to obtain eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which contained mechanism research of acupuncture treatment in IBS-D patients. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction and quality evaluation using the RevMan 5.4.1 software.
RESULTS: Ten trials that covered 19 items related to mechanism research were included in this review. Acupuncture was reported to improve IBS-D symptoms and quality of life, with positive effects in regulating brain-gut peptides, cerebral activities, neuroendocrine functions, psychological state, and inflammatory GI and hypersensitive intestinal tracts.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture has potential influence on pathophysiology alterations such as regulating brain-gut peptides, altering cerebral connectivity and activity, promoting neuroendocrine functions and mental state, and mitigating inflammation as well as hypersensitivity of bowels in IBS-D patients, but further studies of high quality are still necessary.

34132197,Concentrations of bisphenol-A in adults from the general population: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Human bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure has been linked to adverse health effects even at low doses, which may be of potential public health concern.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize BPA concentrations in general human population and their variability according to sex, geographic area, and analytical method.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting BPA concentrations in adult human populations. Separate meta-analyses of median values were carried out for BPA in serum, creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA, and unadjusted urinary BPA concentrations using a random-effects model. Cochran's Q-statistic, I2 index, 95% prediction intervals (PIs), between-studies standard deviation (τ), and forest plots were applied to verify study heterogeneity. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses and weighted ANOVAs and meta-regressions were conducted. Funnel plots and Egger's tests were used to examine publication bias.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis, totaling 28,353 participants. BPA was detected in over 90% of participants. The pooled creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA concentration was 1.76 μg/g (95% PI: 0.79-2.73), with individual estimates ranging between 1.20 and 2.41. The pooled estimate for unadjusted urinary BPA was 1.91 μg/l (95% PI: 0-3.97), ranging between 0.81 and 3.50, while the pooled estimate for serum BPA was 1.75 μg/l (95% PI: 0-10.58), ranging between 0.34 and 3.76. No differences were found by sex, geographic area or analytical technique. Larger sample sizes were associated with lower BPA concentrations. There was large heterogeneity across studies, whereas data for urinary BPA levels suggested a publication bias affecting research in low exposed populations.
CONCLUSION: This first meta-analysis of human BPA concentrations highlights a widespread population exposure to BPA. Although there was high heterogeneity across studies, the expected range of estimated human BPA concentrations suggests that potential health risks are unlikely. Further studies are warranted to better characterize the epidemiology of human BPA exposure, accounting for ethnic, geographic, individual and environmental variability.",Colorado-Yohar SM; Castillo-González AC; Sánchez-Meca J; Rubio-Aparicio M; Sánchez-Rodríguez D; Salamanca-Fernández E; Ardanaz E; Amiano P; Fernández MF; Mendiola J; Navarro-Mateu F; Chirlaque MD,2021,The Science of the total environment,775,,145755,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145755,"Colorado-Yohar, S.

37725328,Hypertension in oral lichen planus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the prevalence and magnitude of the association of hypertension in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published before May 2022, not restricted by publication language or date. The methodological quality and risk of bias of primary-level studies were critically assessed. Meta-analyses were performed, as well as meta-regression, stratified, sensitivity and small-study effects analyses, a Galbraith (radial) plot, and trial sequential analysis. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE system.
RESULTS: 104 studies, including 16,587 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The results show that patients who suffer from OLP have a high prevalence of hypertension (PP = 24.17%, 95% CI = 21.45-27.00), with a low quality of evidence. A significant association between hypertension and oral lichen planus was also reported (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.63, p = 0.04), showing a moderate quality of evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OLP could be at an increased risk of suffering from hypertension which is probably due to multiple factors. Healthcare practitioners involved in OLP management should be aware of this comorbidity in order to apply suitable measures and make referrals if hypertension is suspected, although further research is needed.",De Porras-Carrique T; Ramos-García P; González-Moles MÁ,2024,Oral diseases,30,4,1793-1805,10.1111/odi.14727,"De Porras-Carrique, T., Ramos-García, P., & González-Moles, M.

32056910,Feeling down? A systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Background Anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and burdensome conditions, whose co-occurrence is estimated between 44 and 84%. Shared gut microbiota alterations have been identified in these separate disorders relative to controls; however, studies have not adequately considered their comorbidity. This review set out to identify case-control studies comparing the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression, IBS, and both conditions comorbidly relative to each other and to controls, as well as gut microbiota investigations including measures of both IBS and anxiety/depression. Methods Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal). Most studies investigated the gut microbiota and anxiety/depression symptoms in IBS cohorts. Participants with IBS and high anxiety/depression symptoms had lower alpha diversity compared to controls and IBS-only cohorts. Machine learning and beta diversity distinguished between IBS participants with and without anxiety/depression by their gut microbiota. Comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression also had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Prevotella/Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae relative to controls. Limitations A large number of gut microbiota estimation methods and statistical techniques were utilized; therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions Well-designed case-control and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle whether the gut microbiota is predicted as a continuum of gastrointestinal and anxiety/depression symptom severity, or whether reported dysbiosis is unique to IBS and anxiety/depression comorbidity. These findings may inform the development of targeted treatment through the gut microbiota for individuals with both anxiety/depression and IBS.",Simpson CA; Mu A; Haslam N; Schwartz OS; Simmons JG,2020,Journal of affective disorders,266,,429-446,10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.124,"Simpson, C.

33327230,Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the incidence of IBS has gradually increased, and it is considered as one of the most common functional gastrointestinal diseases. However, the etiology of IBS is still unclear, and expectations are rising for more targeted treatments. Many clinical trials have explored the link between Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and IBS, with different conclusions. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore whether there is an association between H pylori and IBS, which is of great significance for targeted treatment of IBS.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between H pylori and IBS. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Library to collect related studies. OR was used to describe the ratio of the probability of the H pylori infection occurring in IBS patients versus the controls. Heterogeneity was assessed by subgroup and meta-regression analysis.
RESULTS: Eight studies, including 1861 patients, assessed the association between H pylori infection and IBS. The OR of H pylori in IBS patients compared to controls was 1.32 (95% CI: 0.94-1.87; P = 0.11). Subgroup analyses showed a difference between IBS patients diagnosed with Roman III criteria and those diagnosed with non-Roman III criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that H pylori may have a positive effect on the development of IBS. Although the differences were not statistically significant, there were significant differences among subgroups of patients. Considering the limitations and heterogeneity, high quality studies are needed to further explore the effect of H pylori on the development of IBS.",Li C; Shuai Y; Zhou X; Chen H,2020,Medicine,99,50,e22975,10.1097/MD.0000000000022975,"Li, C., Shuai, Y., Zhou, X., & Chen, H.

33470704,Increased prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in migraine patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Even though evidence showing increased prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among migraine patients exists, it has not been well-established and the magnitude of association varies substantially across the studies. This study aimed to comprehensively compare the prevalence of IBS among migraineurs versus nonmigraineurs using the systematic review and the meta-analysis technique.
METHODS: Two authors independently conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar database up to April 2020. The eligible study must consist of two groups of participants, migraineurs and nonmigraineurs, and report the prevalence of IBS in both groups. Alternatively, an eligible study may report the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between migraine and IBS. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
RESULTS: Of the 2531 articles identified from the three databases, 11 studies with a total of 28 336 migraineurs and 1 535 758 nonmigraineurs met the selection criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis found that migraineurs had a significantly higher prevalence of IBS than nonmigraineurs with the pooled OR of 2.49 (95% CI, 2.22-2.78; I2, 42%). The funnel plot was asymmetric and suggested the presence of publication bias.

37944081,Chrononutrition and metabolic health in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"CONTEXT: Obesity has emerged as a global health issue for the pediatric population, increasing the need to investigate physiopathological aspects to prevent the appearance of its cardiometabolic complications. Chrononutrition is a field of research in nutritional sciences that investigates the health impact of 3 different dimensions of feeding behavior: regularity of meals, frequency, and timing of food intake.
OBJECTIVE: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between chrononutrition in children and adolescents and the risk of overweight/obesity or a cluster of metabolic abnormalities related to glucose and lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease risk.
DATA EXTRACTION: A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library for relevant articles published before August 2022.
DATA ANALYSIS: A total of 64 articles were included in the narrative synthesis (47 cross-sectional and 17 cohort studies), while 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that non-daily breakfast consumers (≤6 d/wk) had a higher risk of overweight/obesity (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.82] compared with daily breakfast eaters (7 d/wk). Similarly, irregular breakfast consumption (only 0-to-3 times/wk) increased the risk of abdominal obesity (waist-to-height ratio ≥ 0.5) compared with regular consumption (5-to-7 times/wk) (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.26-1.49). There was evidence to suggest that a regular frequency of meal consumption (≥4 times/d) is preventive against overweight/obesity development compared with fewer meals (≤3 times/d) (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.97). In the narrative synthesis, snacking habits showed controversial results, while food timing was the most understudied dimension.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our data indicate a potential implication of chrononutrition in affecting pediatric metabolic health; however, the evidence of this association is limited and heterogeneous. Further prospective and intervention studies with a consistent approach to categorize the exposure are needed to elucidate the importance of chrononutrition for pediatric metabolic health.",Fiore G; Scapaticci S; Neri CR; Azaryah H; Escudero-Marín M; Pascuzzi MC; La Mendola A; Mameli C; Chiarelli F; Campoy C; Zuccotti G; Verduci E,2024,Nutrition reviews,82,10,1309-1354,10.1093/nutrit/nuad122,"Fiore, G., Scapaticci, S., Neri, C.

34908158,Association between irritable bowel syndrome and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) share similar pathological mechanisms and risk factors.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for a relationship between IBS and PD. Risk estimates from individual studies were pooled using random-effects models.
RESULTS: Six articles involving 58,645 patients with PD were included in our meta-analysis. The overall risk for PD in IBS patients was significantly higher than that in the general population (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-1.75; p < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in risk between men (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.3-1.67; p < .001) and women (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.29-1.75; p < .001); however, older (≥65 years) IBS patients (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.3-1.59; p < .001) may be at higher risk for PD than younger (40-64 years) patients (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.64; p = .017).
CONCLUSION: Overall, the PD risk was higher in IBS patients than others, indicating that the intestinal disorder may serve as a warning sign for PD.",Lu S; Jiang HY; Shi YD,2022,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,145,4,442-448,10.1111/ane.13570,"Lu, S., Jiang, H.

36377578,A systematic review of breast milk microbiota composition and the evidence for transfer to and colonisation of the infant gut.,"The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in infant health and development. However, the role of the breastmilk microbiota in infant gut colonisation remains unclear. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the composition of the breastmilk microbiota and evidence for transfer to/colonisation of the infant gut. Searches were performed using PUBMED, OVID, LILACS and PROQUEST from inception until 18th March 2020 with a PUBMED update to December 2021. 88 full texts were evaluated before final critique based on study power, sample contamination avoidance, storage, purification process, DNA extraction/analysis, and consideration of maternal health and other potential confounders. Risk of skin contamination was reduced mainly by breast cleaning and rejecting the first milk drops. Sample storage, DNA extraction and bioinformatics varied. Several studies stored samples under conditions that may selectively impact bacterial DNA preservation, others used preculture reducing reliability. Only 15 studies, with acceptable sample size, handling, extraction, and bacterial analysis, considered transfer of bacteria to the infant. Three reported bacterial transfer from infant to breastmilk. Despite consistent evidence for the breastmilk microbiota, and recent studies using improved methods to investigate factors affecting its composition, few studies adequately considered transfer to the infant gut providing very little evidence for effective impact on gut colonisation.",Edwards CA; Van Loo-Bouwman CA; Van Diepen JA; Schoemaker MH; Ozanne SE; Venema K; Stanton C; Marinello V; Rueda R; Flourakis M; Gil A; Van der Beek EM,2022,Beneficial microbes,13,5,365-382,10.3920/BM2021.0098,"Edwards, C.

33769962,Exposure to non-persistent pesticides and puberty timing: a systematic review of the epidemiological evidence.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous modern non-persistent pesticides have demonstrated estrogenic/anti-androgenic activity and have been classified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Processes involved in puberty development are vulnerable to EDCs, such as compounds that interfere with the metabolism or activity of sex steroids.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of epidemiological studies on the relationship between early-life exposure to non-persistent pesticides and puberty timing and/or sexual maturation in girls and boys.
METHODS: A systematic search was carried out using MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, including original articles published up to November 2020.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected after excluding non-original and non-human studies. Exposure to different types of pesticides has been associated with altered puberty timing in girls and/or boys in eight studies. In utero exposure to atrazine has been related to earlier age of menarche in girls; exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides has been related to delayed sexual development in boys and girls; childhood pyrethroid exposure has been associated with pubertal delay in girls and pubertal advancement in boys; and prenatal/childhood exposure to multiple pesticides has been linked to earlier puberty onset in girls and pubertal delay in boys.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the reviewed studies describe a relationship between pesticide exposure and changes in the age of puberty onset or sex hormone levels, although the quality of the evidence is generally low. Further well-designed longitudinal studies are warranted on specific classes of pesticides and on possible interactions between different types of compounds.",Castiello F; Freire C,2021,European journal of endocrinology,184,6,733-749,10.1530/EJE-20-1038,"Castiello, F., & Freire, C.

31994293,Diabetes mellitus and oral cancer/oral potentially malignant disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The objective was to evaluate current evidence on the prevalence and risk of oral cancer and potentially malignant oral disorders among patients with diabetes mellitus. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for observational studies published before November 2019. We evaluated the study quality using GRADE, QUIPS, and a specific method for systematic reviews addressing prevalence questions. Meta-analyses were conducted, and heterogeneity and publication bias were examined. A total of 1,489 studies were found, 116 analyzed in full text, 52 included in qualitative synthesis and 49 meta-analyzed. Pooled prevalence (PP) of oral cancer in patients with diabetic was 0.25% (95% CI = 0.15-0.39)-250 per 100,000 patients with diabetes mellitus -with a greater chance of oral cancer among patients with diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.41 [95% CI = 1.10-1.81], p = .007). Patients with oral cancer and diabetes mellitus had a higher mortality than controls (HR = 2.09 [95%CI = 1.36-3.22], p = .001). Leukoplakia had a PP = 2.49% (95% CI = 1.14-4.29)-2,490 per 100,000 patients with diabetes mellitus -(OR = 4.34 [95% CI = 1.14-16.55], p = .03).

37276757,[Longitudinality in Primary Care and Polypharmacy. A Systematic Review].,"The aim of this work was to collect, evaluate and interpret the available evidence on the relationship between continuity in primary care (i.e., longitudinality), and the prevalence of polypharmacy and its associated problems. Following the PRISMA reporting statement, we carried out a systematic review of the literature searching PubMed and Scopus databases. The screening of titles and summaries and the review of references carried out independently by two authors detected 16 works of potential interest, of which 4 were discarded after the independent review of all the originals because they did not meet inclusion criteria. The 12 papers selected studied the relationship between Longitudinality, measured with various quantitative indices, and the rate of polypharmacy or various associated problems, such as duplicate drugs, inadequate prescriptions or drug interactions. They all showed a significant relationship, often strong (RR>2 or<0.5), between longitudinality indicators and the various dependent variables. Although our knowledge could be improved by prospective studies that more directly evaluate longitudinality and its impact on problems due to excess medication, with the existing evidence, we can affirm that the protection and promotion of continuity in primary care can be a key element for the control of polypharmacy and associated problems.",Martín-Díaz M; Pino-Merlo G; Bueno-Cabanillas A; Khan KS,2023,Semergen,49,5,101994,10.1016/j.semerg.2023.101994,"Martín-Díaz, M., Pino-Merlo, G., Bueno-Cabanillas, A., & Khan, K.

36625209,Type D Personality as a Marker of Poorer Quality of Life and Mood Status Disturbances in Patients with Skin Diseases: A Systematic Review.,"Type D personality is characterized by social inhibition and negative affectivity. Poorer outcomes and worse quality of life have been linked to type D personality in patients with a variety of non-dermatological diseases. Despite increasing evidence of the importance of type D personality in skin diseases, there are no reviews on this subject. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence regarding type D personality and skin diseases. A systematic search was performed using Medline and Web of Science databases from inception to 11 October 2022. Studies addressing the presence of type D personality, its associated factors, its impact on the outcomes of the disease or the quality of life of the patients were included in the systematic review. A total of 20 studies, including 3,124 participants, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, melanoma, atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria and pruritic disorders were the main diseases assessed. Type D personality was more frequent among patients with skin diseases than among controls. Type D personality was found to be associated with poorer quality of life and higher rates of psychological comorbidities in patients with skin diseases. In conclusion, type D personality appears to be a marker of patients with increased risk of poorer quality of life and higher rates of psychological comorbidities. Screening for type D personality in specialized dermatology units might be beneficial to identify patients who are more psychologically vulnerable to the consequences of chronic skin diseases.",Sánchez-Díaz M; Montero-Vílchez T; Quiñones-Vico MI; Sierra-Sánchez Á; Ubago-Rodríguez A; Sanabria-de la Torre R; Molina-Leyva A; Arias-Santiago S,2023,Acta dermato-venereologica,103,,adv00846,10.2340/actadv.v103.2741,"Sánchez-Díaz, M., Montero-Vílchez, T., Quiñones-Vico, M.

36649166,Systematic review with meta-analysis: Stress-management interventions for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder of unknown pathological origin that is associated with psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We investigated the effects of stress-management for adults with IBS on typical symptoms, HRQoL and mental health. With predefined criteria (patients: adults with IBS; intervention: stress-management; control: care as usual or waitlist; outcome: patient-relevant; study-type: controlled trials), we registered the study with PROSPERO (168030) and searched the main medical databases. Two researchers independently reviewed the publications and assessed the risk of bias using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist. We performed meta-analysis with homogeneous trials of acceptable quality. After screening 6656 publications, ten suitable randomized trials of acceptable (n = 5) or low methodological quality (n = 5) involving 587 patients were identified. Our meta-analysis showed no effect of stress-management on IBS severity 1-2 months after the intervention (Hedges' g = -0.23, 95%-CI = -0.84 to -0.38, I2 = 86.1%), and after 3-12 months (Hedges' g = -0.77, 95%-CI = -1.77 to -0.23, I2 = 93.3%). One trial found a short-term reduction of symptoms, and one trial found symptom relief in the long-term (at 6 months). One of two studies that examined HRQoL found an improvement (after 2 months). One of two studies that examined depression and anxiety found a reduction of these symptoms (after 3 weeks). Stress-management may be beneficial for patients with IBS regarding the short-term reduction of bowel and mental health symptoms, whereas long-term benefits are unclear. Good quality RCTs with more than 6 months follow-up are needed.",Horn A; Stangl S; Parisi S; Bauer N; Roll J; Löffler C; Gágyor I; Haas K; Heuschmann PU; Langhorst J; Keil T,2023,Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress,39,4,694-707,10.1002/smi.3226,"Horn, A., Stangl, S., Parisi, S., Bauer, N., Roll, J., Löffler, C., Gágyor, I., Haas, K., Heuschmann, P.

37764853,"The Effect of Polyphenols, Minerals, Fibers, and Fruits on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Various dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and management of IBS symptoms. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of polyphenols, minerals, fibers, and fruits on the symptoms and overall well-being of individuals with IBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies published up until July 2023 were included.
RESULTS: The selected studies varied in terms of study design, participant characteristics, intervention duration, and outcome measures. Overall, the findings suggest that dietary interventions involving polyphenols, minerals, fibers, and fruits can have a positive impact on IBS symptoms. Dietary fiber supplementation, particularly soluble fiber, has been associated with reduced bloating and enhanced stool consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of polyphenols, minerals, fibers, and fruits in IBS patients. These dietary components hold promise as complementary approaches for managing IBS symptoms. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the limited number of high-quality randomized controlled trials, further well-designed trials are warranted to establish the optimal dosages, duration, and long-term effects of these interventions. Understanding the role of specific dietary components in IBS management may pave the way for personalized dietary recommendations and improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from this complex disorder.",Chiarioni G; Popa SL; Ismaiel A; Pop C; Dumitrascu DI; Brata VD; Duse TA; Incze V; Surdea-Blaga T,2023,Nutrients,15,18,,10.3390/nu15184070,"Chiarioni, G., Popa, S.

35870501,Pyrethroids and developmental neurotoxicity - A critical review of epidemiological studies and supporting mechanistic evidence.,"BACKGROUND: Pyrethroid metabolites are widely detectable in urine from the general population, including pregnant women and children. Pyrethroids are neurotoxic and suggested endocrine disruptors. Exposure during vulnerable developmental time windows may have long-term impacts on neurodevelopment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiological evidence for neurodevelopmental effects related to prenatal and childhood pyrethroid exposure in a systematic review and to assess biological plausibility by evaluating mechanistic evidence.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science up to September 1, 2021 and included original studies published in English in which pyrethroid exposure was measured or estimated during pregnancy or childhood and associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes in the children were investigated. The Navigation Guide Systematic Review Methodology was used to evaluate the epidemiological evidence. For mechanistic evidence, we focused on relevant key events (KEs) suggested in Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) using the OECD-supported AOP-wiki platform. A systematic search combining the KEs with pyrethroids, including 26 individual compounds, was performed in the ToxCast database.
RESULTS: Twenty-five epidemiological studies met the inclusion criteria, 17 presented findings on prenatal exposure, 10 on childhood exposure and two on both exposure windows. The overall body of evidence was rated as ""moderate quality"" with ""sufficient evidence"" for an association between prenatal pyrethroid exposure and adverse neurodevelopment. For childhood exposure, the overall rating was ""low quality"" with ""limited evidence"" because of cross-sectional study design. Regarding mechanistic evidence, we found that pyrethroids are able to interfere with neurodevelopmental KEs included in established AOPs for adverse neurodevelopmental. The evidence was strongest for interference with thyroid hormone (TH) function.
CONCLUSION: Pyrethroids are probably human developmental neurotoxicants and adverse impacts of pyrethroid exposure on neurodevelopment are likely at exposure levels occurring in the general population. Preventive measures to reduce exposure among pregnant women and children are warranted.",Andersen HR; David A; Freire C; Fernández MF; D'Cruz SC; Reina-Pérez I; Fini JB; Blaha L,2022,Environmental research,214,Pt 2,113935,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113935,"Andersen, H.

However, molecules that regulate irritable bowel syndrome have not been fully clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit the translation of target messenger RNAs. Previous studies have shown that miRNAs have critical roles in the regulation of the pathogenicity of irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, this systematic review focused on miRNAs that regulate irritable bowel syndrome. PubMed and Web of Science were searched to retrieve reference lists of eligible articles and related reviews. Original articles and reviews that reported the utility of miRNAs as potential biomarkers or targets for specific therapies of IBS that were published in English from 2004 to 2021 were included. Among 78 identified studies, 22 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. These results suggest that miRNAs are potential biomarkers and targets of gene therapy for IBS.

39683378,"Examining the Association Between Overweight, Obesity, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common yet debilitating disorder of gut-brain interaction, characterized by gut-brain axis dysregulation, visceral hypersensitivity, and other comorbidities. Obesity has been hypothesized to be a risk factor linked to IBS, albeit evidence remains conflicting. Given the growing global prevalence of obesity and IBS, we performed a meta-analysis examining their purported association.
METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies reporting the prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) of IBS according to BMI categories. Random effects meta-analyses were used for the primary analysis.
RESULTS: From 1713 articles, 27 studies were included. Our findings showed that using study-defined categories for overweight, obese, and normal BMI, the odds of the diagnosis of IBS were not associated with overweight (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; p = 0.772) or obese BMI (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; p = 0.309). The meta-analysis of study-reported adjusted odds ratios of IBS among individuals living with overweight or obesity also did not yield significant results. Further sensitivity analysis by the Rome criteria demonstrated a statistically significant association between obese BMI and IBS in studies using the Rome IV criteria (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.23; p < 0.01), with significant subgroup difference between studies using the Rome II, Rome III, and Rome IV criteria. Further sensitivity analysis using the different cut-off values and subgroup analysis by geographical territory did not yield significant associations.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, excess body weight may not be a primary driver of IBS risk. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies that account for changes in weight and other lifestyle factors, as well as detailed mechanistic investigations.",Yau CE; Lim GSJ; Ang AYH; Lim YL; Goh OQM; Siah KTH; Ng QX,2024,Nutrients,16,23,,10.3390/nu16233984,"Yau, C.

34527656,Worldwide Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence in Pregnancy. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects outcomes of mothers and their offspring. This systematic review collated the worldwide literature on the prevalence rates of different types of IPV in pregnancy. Methods: Two reviewers independently identified cross sectional and cohort studies of IPV prevalence in pregnancy in online databases (PubMed, WOS and Scopus), selected and extracted data [participants' country, study quality, measurement tool (validation and purpose) and rates of IPV in pregnancy]. We considered a high quality study if it had a prospective design, an adequate sampling method, a sample size estimation, a response rate > 90%, a contemporary ascertainment of IPV in the index pregnancy, and a well-developed detailed IPV tool. We performed random effects meta-analysis and explored reasons for heterogeneity of rates. Results: One hundred fifty-five studies were included, of which 44 (28%) met two-thirds of the quality criteria. Worldwide prevalence of physical (126 studies, 220,462 participants), psychological (113 studies, 189,630 participants) and sexual (98 studies, 155,324 participants) IPV in pregnancy was 9.2% (95% CI 7.7-11.1%, I2 95.9%), 18.7% (15.1-22.9%, I2 98.2%), 5.5% (4.0-7.5%, I2 93.4%), respectively. Where several types of IPV were reported combined, the prevalence of any kind of IPV (118 studies, 124,838 participants) was 25.0% (20.3, 30.5%, I2 98.6%). IPV rates varied within and between continents, being the highest in Africa and the lowest in Europe (p < 0.001). Rates also varied according to measurement purpose, being higher for diagnosis than for screening, in physical (p = 0.022) and sexual (p = 0.014) IPV. Conclusions: IPV prevalence in pregnancy varies across countries, with one-quarter of mothers exposed on average globally. Routine systematic antenatal detection should be applied worldwide.

39614602,Systematic review: The gut microbiota as a link between colorectal cancer and obesity.,"Microbiome modulation is one of the novel strategies in medicine with the greatest future to improve the health of individuals and reduce the risk of different conditions, including metabolic, immune, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Regarding the latter, many studies have reported the role of the gut microbiome in carcinogenesis, formation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as its response to different systemic therapies. Likewise, obesity, one of the most important risk factors for CRC, is also well known for its association with gut dysbiosis. Moreover, obesity and CRC display, apart from microbial dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, which participates in their pathogenesis. Although human and murine studies demonstrate the significant impact of the microbiome in regulating energy metabolism and CRC development, little is understood about the contribution of the microbiome to the development of obesity-associated CRC. Therefore, this systematic review explores the evidence for microbiome changes associated with these conditions and hypothesizes that this may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-related CRC. Two databases were searched, and different studies on the relationship among obesity, intestinal microbiota and CRC in clinical and preclinical models were selected. Data extraction was carried out by two reviewers independently, and 101 studies were finally considered. Findings indicate the existence of a risk association between obesity and CRC derived from metabolic, immune, and microbial disorders.",Ruiz-Malagón AJ; Rodríguez-Sojo MJ; Redondo E; Rodríguez-Cabezas ME; Gálvez J; Rodríguez-Nogales A,2025,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,26,4,e13872,10.1111/obr.13872,"Ruiz-Malagón, A.

34486656,Systematic Review of the Effects of Oat Intake on Gastrointestinal Health.,"BACKGROUND: Oats are a food source with multiple health benefits that could support beneficial bacterial groups and provide important bioactive compounds for the gut.
OBJECTIVES: This review explores the association between oat intake, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and microbial community changes in individuals with celiac disease (CeD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and without GI disease.
METHODS: Four databases and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception until April 29, 2021. Clinical trials, observational studies, and in vitro studies with human gut-derived samples were included.
RESULTS: There were 84 articles [23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 21 nonrandomized trials, 8 observational studies, and 32 in vitro studies] included. Oat intake increased total bacterial count, Lactobacilli spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. in healthy individuals and those with CeD. There was an increased concentration of short-chain fatty acids and improved gut permeability with oat intake but with no significant quality-of-life difference. In some individuals with CeD, consumption of certain oat types was associated with worsening of GI symptoms. We found no studies reporting on IBS and only 3 for IBD. The quality of RCTs showed some concerns mostly in domains of randomization (73.9%), whereas the quality of evidence of non-RCTs, observational studies, and in vitro studies was satisfactory.
CONCLUSIONS: Oat intake was associated with the increase of beneficial bacterial groups in individuals without GI disease and those with CeD. Most studies showed no changes in GI symptoms with oat consumption. In vitro studies in CeD provide insight to oat-sensitive individuals and their GI mucosa, but the clinical studies remain limited, precluding our ability to draw firm conclusions. The prevalence of oat sensitivity in individuals with CeD should be further explored as this could improve clinical management and facilitate inclusion of oat in the diet for this population.",Valido E; Stoyanov J; Bertolo A; Hertig-Godeschalk A; Zeh RM; Flueck JL; Minder B; Stojic S; Metzger B; Bussler W; Muka T; Kern H; Glisic M,2021,The Journal of nutrition,151,10,3075-3090,10.1093/jn/nxab245,"Valido, E., Stoyanov, J., Bertolo, A., Hertig-Godeschalk, A., Zeh, R.

36013502,Helicobacterpylori Infection-A Risk Factor for Irritable Bowel Syndrome? An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"UNLABELLED: Nowadays, the relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection (HPI) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between HPI and IBS through a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the current evidence.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library) by computer to identify all reports published before 8 August 2021. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the association between HPI and IBS. Subgroup analyses were conducted for further assessment and exploration of heterogeneity sources. In addition, we assessed publication bias through funnel plots, Egger's test, and Begg's test. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 13,173 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the association between HPI and IBS was 1.03 (95% CI [0.80,1.31]; p = 0.84). The adjusted OR of the association between HPI and IBS after excluding the studies with confounding factors defined by our team was 1.29 (95% CI [1.03,1.62]; p = 0.03). We found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D (diarrhea subtype) (OR: 1.54; 95% CI [1.22,1.95]; p = 0.0003). The OR of the relationship between cytotoxin-associated gene A (Cag A) positive HPI and IBS was 4.3 (95% CI [0.51,36.17]; p = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of HPI in IBS patients is relatively higher than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant, implying that HPI is not significantly associated with IBS, albeit we may underestimate this association. Moreover, we found a positive association between HPI and IBS-D. We also observed an increased likelihood of Cag-A positive HPI in IBS patients than that of non-IBS participants but not statistically significant.",Wang Z; Liu Y; Peng Y; Peng L,2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",58,8,,10.3390/medicina58081035,"Wang, Z., Liu, Y., Peng, Y., & Peng, L.

A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SPORTDiscuss, and PsycINFO from their inception to February 2024. The systematic review included 32 studies, with 15 studies (13 RCT and 2 quasi-experimental) and 3604 participants (66.7% female) included in the meta-analysis involving controlled trials using a control group and at least one PA intervention group. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022309771). Risk of bias for RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB2), and quasi-experimental studies with the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. PA significantly improved self-esteem during and after cancer treatment (pooled SMD = 0.32, p < 0.01). Specifically, aerobic PA (pooled SMD = 0.33, p = 0.04) and mind-body exercise (pooled SMD = 0.70, p = 0.03) had positive effects on self-esteem. Overall, PA interventions improved self-esteem during cancer treatment (pooled SMD = 0.50, p = 0.01) and in PA interventions lasting more than 12 weeks (pooled SMD = 0.44, p = 0.02).

36719820,"A systematic review, pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials exploring the role of fecal microbiota transplantation in irritable bowel syndrome.","BACKGROUND: Treatment is a challenge in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has attracted significant interest. Network meta-analysis (NWM) has been established as an evidence-synthesis tool that incorporates direct and indirect evidence in a collection of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapeutic intervention competing for similar therapeutic results. No NWM exists concerning the comparative effectiveness and safety of various FMT modalities for IBS.
AIM: We updated pairwise meta-analyses published in the past and assessed the comparative effectiveness and safety of various FMT delivery modalities for IBS.
METHODS: Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian NWM were performed. Heterogeneity, consistency of results and publication bias were explored.
RESULTS: Of 510 titles raised by initial search, seven RCTs were entered into meta-analyses and NWM. They included 470 patients and controls, in whom four FMT delivery modalities were used, that is via colonoscopy, nasojejunal tube, duodenoscope and capsules per os. In the pairwise meta-analysis, the pooled results showed that overall FMT was not superior to placebo, whereas the subgroup analyses showed that FMT via duodenoscope and nasojejunal tube was superior. The NWM showed that 60-g FMT via duodenoscope had the highest efficacy (OR, 26.38; 95% CI, 9.22-75.51) and was by far the highest in the efficacy ranking (SUCRA, 98.8%).
CONCLUSION: The pooled results showed no overall advantage of FMT over placebo in IBS. However, upper GI delivery (via duodenoscopy or nasojejunal tube) proved to be effective. Consequently, well-designed RCTs are needed to ensure the efficacy and safety profile before FMT can be applied in everyday clinical practice for IBS patients.",Rokkas T; Hold GL,2023,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,35,4,471-479,10.1097/MEG.0000000000002519,"Rokkas, T., & Hold, G.

Asan external therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), moxibustion is usually used to treat IBS-D. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of moxibustion in treating patients with IBS-D.
METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the use of moxibustion in IBS-D treatment was performed in eight databases.
RESULTS: Eleven RCTs including 725 participants meet the inclusion criteria. Compared with other positive treatments (Western medicine, TCM prescription, and acupuncture), moxibustion treatment had superior effects against IBS-D according to the meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review provided preliminary research evidence that moxibustion is effective in treating IBS-D. Rigorously designed and large-scale RCTs are required to provide more robust evidence in this area.",Dai YQ; Weng H; Wang Q; Guo XJ; Wu Q; Zhou L; Huang L,2022,Complementary therapies in clinical practice,46,,101532,10.1016/j.ctcp.2021.101532,"Dai, Y.

35493361,The Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Among Chinese University Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has become a common public health issue among university students, impairing their physical and mental health. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the pooled prevalence of IBS and its associated factors among Chinese university students.
METHODS: Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE (via EBSCO), CINAHL (via EBSCO), Wan Fang, CNKI and Weipu (via VIP) were systematically searched from inception date to May 31, 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were used to detect the potential source of heterogeneity.
KEY RESULTS: A total of 22 cross-sectional studies (14 were in Chinese and 8 were in English) with 33,166 Chinese university students were included. The pooled prevalence of IBS was estimated as 11.89% (95% CI = 8.06%, 16.35%). The prevalence was 10.50% (95% CI = 6.80%, 15.87%) in Rome II criteria, 12.00% (95% CI = 8.23%, 17.17%) in Rome III criteria, and 3.66% (95% CI = 2.01%, 6.60%) in Rome IV criteria. The highest prevalence of IBS was 17.66% (95% CI = 7.37%, 36.64%) in North China, and the lowest was 3.18% (95% CI = 1.28%, 7.68%) in South China. Subgroup analyses indicated that gender, major, anxiety and depression symptoms, drinking and smoking behaviors were significantly associated with the prevalence of IBS. Meta-regression analyses suggested that region influenced prevalence estimates for IBS.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: This meta-analysis illustrated that IBS is very common in Chinese university students. Regular screening, effective prevention, and appropriate treatments should be implemented to reduce the risk of IBS in this population. More future studies should be conducted in Northeastern and Southwestern parts of China.",Yang W; Yang X; Cai X; Zhou Z; Yao H; Song X; Zhao T; Xiong P,2022,Frontiers in public health,10,,864721,10.3389/fpubh.2022.864721,"Yang, W., Yang, X., Cai, X., Zhou, Z., Yao, H., Song, X., Zhao, T., & Xiong, P.

35879058,Efficacy of a Restrictive Diet in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dietary factors can aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many IBS patients try restrictive diets to relieve their symptoms, but the types of diets with an exacerbating factor are unknown. Therefore, this paper reports the results of a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) reviewing the efficacy of food restriction diets in IBS.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched until July 21, 2021, to retrieve RCTs assessing the efficacy of restriction diets in adults with IBS. Two independent reviewers performed the eligibility assessment and data abstraction. RCTs that evaluated a restriction diet versus a control diet and assessed the improvement in global IBS symptoms were included. These trials reported a dichotomous assessment of the overall response to therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 1,949 citations were identified. After full-text screening, 14 RCTs were considered eligible for the systematic review and network meta-analysis. A starch- and sucrose-reduced diet and a diet with low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) showed significantly better results than a usual diet. Symptom flare-ups in patients on a gluten- free diet were also significantly lower than in those on high-gluten diets.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that the starch- and sucrose-reduced, low FODMAP, and gluten-free diets had superior effects in reducing IBS symptoms. Further studies, including head-to-head trials will be needed to establish the effectiveness of dietary restrictions on IBS symptoms.",Yu SJ; Lee HS; Gung HJ; Kim JS; Kim KB; Kwon YH; Kim JH; Koo HS; Shin HD; Jee SR; Lee HB; Kim J; Park HW,2022,The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi,80,1,6-16,10.4166/kjg.2022.014,"Yu, S.

36867517,Biomarkers for Bile Acid Malabsorption in Diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: A clear relationship of biological indexes between bile acid malabsorption (BAM) and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) has not been well analyzed. This meta-analysis aimed to establish a more convenient method to diagnose BAM in IBS-D patients by comparing the differences in biomarkers between IBS-D patients and healthy people.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched for relevant case-control studies. Indicators used to diagnose BAM included 75 Se-homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT), 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one(C4), fibroblast growth factor-19 and 48-hour fecal bile acid (48FBA). The rate of BAM (SeHCAT) was calculated by using a random-effect model. The levels of C4, FGF19, and 48FBA were compared, and the overall effect size was combined by a fixed effect model.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 10 relevant studies comprising 1034 IBS-D patients and 232 healthy volunteers. The pooled rate of BAM in IBS-D patients was 32% (according to SeHCAT; 95% CI: 24%-40%). The level of C4 in IBS-D patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (2.86 ng/mL; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.63); The level of FGF19 was significantly lower than that in the control group (-33.97 pg/mL; 95% CI: -51.13, -16.82); The level of 48FBA was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.059; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: The results mainly concluded serum C4 and FGF19 levels in IBS-D patients. Most of the studies have different normal cutoff points of serum C4 and FGF19 levels; the performance of each test should be further estimated. By comparing the levels of these biomarkers, BAM in patients with IBS-D could be identified more accurately, which would lead to more effective treatment.",Liu T; Ma M; Li K; Tan W; Yu H; Wang L,,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,57,5,451-458,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001841,"Liu, T., Ma, M., Li, K., Tan, W., Yu, H., & Wang, L.

34941977,Searching for a Definition of Refractory Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pathological mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unclarified, which commonly leads to unresponsiveness to conventional treatments. The diagnostic criteria for refractory IBS are not clearly defined. We performed a systematic review to summarize the key points of the definition of refractory IBS in different studies. We also conducted a meta-analysis to explore whether the diverse definitions for refractory IBS affect the therapeutic effect of gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH).
METHODS: We searched OVID Medline, Embase and Cochrane (until September 2020) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting patients with refractory IBS. We evaluated the definition of refractory IBS through the following aspects: duration of symptoms, unresponsive to dietary intervention, lifestyle modification, pharmacology, psychology, severity assessment and adequate explanation. The effect of the different definitions for refractory IBS on the therapeutic effect of gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) was checked by a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were finally included. Six (28.6%) out of 21 RCTs recruited patients with symptoms lasting for over 12 months; 8 (38.1%) RCTs reported a prior use of dietary intervention; 1 (4.8%) RCT reported the use of lifestyle modification; 11 (52.4%) RCTs recruited patients who were unresponsive to pharmacology; 2 (9.5%) RCTs recruited patients with no response to psychological therapy ; 5 (23.8%) RCTs had symptoms severity assessment; and 8 (38.1%) RCTs recruited patients who were informed adequately. Despite being tested in trials with heterogeneous definition of refractory IBS, GDH had similar effectiveness when compared with supportive treatment [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.69, 95%CI: -0.93 to -0.44)] or waiting-list control (SMD=-0.54, 95%CI: -0.98 to -0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Varied definitions in refractory IBS were common phenomena in clinical studies. Resistance to symptom severity assessment and psychological treatments should be more explicitly defined. Gut-directed hypnotherapy was efficacious for refractory IBS and was not affected by the diversity in the definition of refractory IBS among RCTs.",Peng WY; Ye K; Qin D; Tang TC; Chen M; Zheng H,2021,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,30,4,495-505,10.15403/jgld-3952,"Peng, W.

37844863,Phthalate exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome components: A systematic review.,"Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, i.e. obesity, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels and arterial hypertension. Phthalates are environmental chemicals which might influence the risk of the aforementioned disturbances, although the evidence is still controversial. The objective of this work was to synthesize the evidence on the association between human phthalate exposure and metabolic syndrome or any of its components. In this systematic review, the PRISMA guidelines were followed and the literature was search in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies were included, the later only if a subclinical marker of disease was evaluated. The methodological quality was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and a checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies developed in the Joanna Briggs Institute. A total of 58 articles were identified that showed high heterogenicity in the specific phthalates assessed, time-window of exposure and duration of follow-up. The quality of the studies was evaluated as high (n = 46, score >7 points) or medium (n = 12, score 4-6). The most frequently studied phthalates were DEHP-MEHP, MBzP and MEP. The evidence revealed a positive association between prenatal (in utero) exposure to most phthalates and markers of obesity in the offspring, but contradictory results when postnatal exposure and obesity were assessed. Moreover, postnatal phthalate exposure showed positive and very consistent associations with markers of diabetes and, to a lesser extent, with triglyceride levels. However, fewer evidence and contradictory results were found for HDL-c levels and markers of hypertension. The suggested mechanisms for these metabolic effects include transcription factor PPAR activation, antagonism of thyroid hormone function, antiandrogenic effects, oxidative stress and inflammation, and epigenetic changes. Nevertheless, as the inconsistency of some results could be related to differences in the study design, future research should aim to standardise the exposure assessment.",Perez-Diaz C; Uriz-Martínez M; Ortega-Rico C; Leno-Duran E; Barrios-Rodríguez R; Salcedo-Bellido I; Arrebola JP; Requena P,2024,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",340,Pt 1,122714,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122714,"Perez-Diaz, C., Uriz-Martínez, M., Ortega-Rico, C., Leno-Duran, E., Barrios-Rodríguez, R., Salcedo-Bellido, I., Arrebola, J.

39847508,Copper in colorectal cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several clinical studies have evaluated the relationship between copper on colorectal cancer (CRC), but the results are contradictory. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate copper measured in two biological matrices (serum/plasma/blood and tissue) and dietary intake in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. We conducted a comprehensive and systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. We included studies that reported copper levels in serum/plasma/blood, tissue, or from the diet, with an observational study design (cohort and case-control studies). Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and potential causes of heterogeneity were evaluated. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using random-effect models. Overall pooled odds ratio and 95% CI for the risk of CRC were calculated. Twenty-six studies (23 case-control and 3 cohort studies) with a total of 227 354 participants were included. Most of the studies presented low (50%) or moderate quality (42.3%). No differences in serum/plasma/blood copper levels (SMD = 0.23; 95% CI: -0.23, 0.70; I2 = 97.3%, 19 studies), tissue copper levels (SMD = -1.69; 95% CI: -3.41, 0.03; I2 = 85.6%, 2 studies), or copper/zinc ratio (SMD = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.84; I2 = 95.3%, 6 studies) were found between CRC patients and healthy controls. Regarding dietary copper, CRC patients had a lower intake (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI: -0.51, -0.03; I2 = 0.0%, 2 studies). No differences were found in copper levels between CRC patients and healthy controls. However, evidence shows mostly low or moderate quality, and results were heterogeneous.

33348297,Bidirectional association between irritable bowel syndrome and restless legs syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have shown that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a high risk of restless legs syndrome (RLS). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate the bidirectional association between IBS and RLS.
METHODS: All conservational studies on IBS and RLS were searched in MEDLINE (assessed by PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library database and Google Scholar from inception to June 14, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality were used to assess the methodological quality of the cohort and cross-sectional studies, respectively. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Reviewer Manager 5.3.
RESULT: A total of five cross-sectional studies of moderate methodological quality and one cohort study of high methodological quality were included in our review. Four cross-sectional studies and one cohort study involving 86 438 individuals met the criteria of IBS predicating the onset of RLS. Patients with IBS had a nearly three-fold increased odds of RLS compared with controls (OR = 2.60, 95%CI: 2.17-3.12, P < 0.00001; I2 = 48%, P = 0.11). Three sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the pooled result. Two cross-sectional studies involving 3581 individuals met the criteria of RLS predicating the onset of IBS. RLS patients had a nearly four-fold increased odds of IBS compared with controls without RLS (OR = 3.87, 95%CI: 1.73-8.66, P = 0.0010; I2 = 77%, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found a substantial bidirectional association between IBS and RLS. More prospective, high-quality, population-based studies are warranted in the future.",Guo J; Pei L; Chen L; Chen H; Gu D; Peng Y; Sun J,2021,Sleep medicine,77,,104-111,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.12.002,"Guo, J., Pei, L., Chen, L., Chen, H., Gu, D., Peng, Y., & Sun, J.

37275867,Fecal microbiota transplantation for irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: Whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is effective in improving outcomes remains controversial. We assessed the safety and efficacy of FMT for patients with IBS.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the clinicaltrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to February 25, 2022, updated to March 28, 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared the stool and capsule FMT with placebo in patients with IBS were included. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We did meta-analysis with RevMan, and the Stata software was used for sensitivity analysis and meta-regression. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality of evidences. Mean difference (MD) or standardized Mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous data, and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous data were used with random-effects models. The primary outcomes included the clinical response rate and IBS-SSS score. This study is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42022328377.
RESULTS: Nineteen reports from nine RCTs were included finally. Compared with the placebo, a single stool FMT could significantly decrease the IBS-SSS score at 1 month (MD=-65.75, 95%CI [-129.37, -2.13]), 3 months (MD=-102.11, 95% CI [-141.98, -62.24]), 6 months (MD=-84.38, 95%CI [-158.79, -9.97]), 24 months (MD=-110.41, 95%CI [-145.37, -75.46]), and 36 months (MD=-104.71, 95%CI [-137.78, -71.64]). It also could improve the clinical response rate at 3 months (RR=1.91, 95% [1.12, 3.25]), 24 months (RR=2.97, 95% [1.94, 4.54]), and 36 months (RR=2.48, 95% [1.65, 3.72]), and increase the IBS-QoL score at 3 months, 24 months, and 36 months. FMT did not increase the serious adverse event. The risk of bias was low, and the quality of evidence based on GRADE system was moderate in the stool FMT group. However, we did not find positive effect of capsule FMT on patients with IBS based on the current available data.
CONCLUSION: A single stool FMT is effective and safe for patients with IBS. However, some factors may affect the effectiveness of FMT, and the relationship between the gut microbiome and the effect of FMT for IBS is still unclear.

35477143,Intralesional Treatments in Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Systematic Review.,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory chronic disease with difficult management. In some scenarios, intralesional (IL) treatments could be useful. However, the scientific evidence available is limited and heterogeneous. We aimed to synthesize the available scientific evidence on IL treatments in HS. We conducted a systematic review in July 2021. The clinical databases reviewed included MEDLINE and Embase. All types of epidemiological studies and case series with at least 10 patients were included; reviews, guidelines, protocols, conference abstracts, case series with less than 10 patients, and case reports were excluded. Fifteen articles representing 599 patients and 1,032 lesions were included for review. Corticosteroid injections were the most reported treatment. They showed effectiveness for the treatment of acute inflammatory lesions and fistulas in terms of reduction of lesion counts, symptoms, and signs of inflammation and were safe in general terms. Light-based therapies were the other main treatment group, including photodynamic therapy and 1,064-nm diode laser. They were also effective, but more local and systemic adverse events were reported. Other treatments included botulinum toxin type B and punch-trocar-assisted cryoinsufflation (cryopunch). They were effective and safe, although were reported anecdotally. The main limitation of the systematic review was the general quality of the articles included. In conclusion, IL treatments such as corticosteroid injections and light-based therapies seem to be effective and safe for both acute inflammatory lesions and fistulas, although more prospective studies, with higher sample sizes and with standardized outcomes are needed to provide more scientific evidence on the subject.",Cuenca-Barrales C; Montero-Vílchez T; Sánchez-Díaz M; Martínez-López A; Rodríguez-Pozo JÁ; Díaz-Calvillo P; Arias-Santiago S; Molina-Leyva A,2022,"Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)",238,6,1084-1091,10.1159/000524121,"Cuenca-Barrales, C., Montero-Vílchez, T., Sánchez-Díaz, M., Martínez-López, A., Rodríguez-Pozo, J.

36620677,Acupuncture and related therapies for the anxiety and depression in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D): A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: A growing number of clinical studies have suggested the value of acupuncture-related therapies for patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), and the patient's mental state plays an important role, but there are many types of acupuncture-related therapies involved. This study aimed to evaluate the mental status, efficacy and safety of the different acupuncture-related therapies for IBS-D patients.
METHODS: We searched seven databases to collect randomized controlled trials of acupuncture-related therapies for IBS-D. After independent literature screening and data extraction, the quality of the final included literature was evaluated. Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA), hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and self-rating depression scale (SDS) was used as the primary outcome indicator. And the network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed by using Revman 5.4, Stata 15.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 software, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve was conducted to rank the included interventions.
RESULTS: We analyzed 24 eligible studies with 1,885 patients, involving eight types of acupuncture and related therapies along with comprehensive therapies. The NMA result shows that: for SAS scores, combined therapies were more efficacious than anti-diarrheal or antispasmodic (western medicine, WM) (SMD: -8.92; 95% CI: -15.30, -2.47); for SDS scores, combined therapies were more efficacious than WM (SMD: -8.45; 95% CI: -15.50, -1.41). For HAMA scores, moxibustion (MOX) was more efficacious than placebo (SMD: -8.66; 95% CI: -16.64, -0.38). For HAMD scores, MOX was more efficacious than all other included interventions. For response rate, MOX was more efficacious than the following interventions: acupuncture (ACU) (SMD:0.29; 95% CI:0.08,0.93), Chinese herb medicine (CH) (SMD:0.09; 95% CI:0.02,0.36), combined therapies (SMD:0.23; 95% CI:0.06, 0.85), electroacupuncture (EA) (SMD:0.06; 95% CI:0.01,0.33), warm acupuncture (WA) (SMD:22.16; 95% CI:3.53,148.10), WM (SMD:15.59; 95% CI:4.68,61.21), and placebo (SMD:9.80; 95% CI:2.90,45.51). Combined therapies were more efficacious than the following interventions: CH (SMD:0.39; 95% CI:0.19,0.80), WA (SMD:4.96; 95% CI:1.30,21.62), and WM (SMD:3.62; 95% CI:2.35,5.66). The comprehensive ranking results show that MOX, ACU, combined therapies, and EA had high SUCRA rankings involving different outcome indicators.
CONCLUSION: MOX, ACU, combined therapies, and EA better alleviate anxiety and depression among IBS-D patients, and with a higher safety level, may be the optimal therapies. In addition, combining acupuncture-related treatments and other therapies also delivers a higher global benefit level.

34630293,Association Between Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are respectively one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and functional bowel diseases in the world. Recent studies suggest that patients with IBS seem to have a higher risk of PD, which conflicts with the result of previous meta-analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate all available evidence, in order to clarify the association between PD and IBS. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library on April 25, 2021 to identify all records that explore the association between IBS and PD. All reports that clearly define PD and IBS and analyze the relationship between the two were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Results: Five studies from four articles involving 2,044,110 subjects were included in this analysis. The pooled results demonstrated a significant association between PD and IBS (1.48; 95% CI: 1.35-1.62, P < 0.001), with subtle heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.0%, p = 0.585). The association was observed across genders and increased with age. However, the available evidence cannot allow a reliable analysis of the causal relationship between IBS and PD. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a higher risk of PD among subjects with IBS. Future studies are required to further clarify the causation and underlying mechanism of the association.",Zhang X; Svn Z; Liv M; Yang Y; Zeng R; Huang Q; Sun Q,2021,Frontiers in neurology,12,,720958,10.3389/fneur.2021.720958,"Zhang, X., Svn, Z., Liv, M., Yang, Y., Zeng, R., Huang, Q., & Sun, Q.

40179285,Gut-Directed Hypnotherapy for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, but prior studies have been small with variable delivery modalities. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the efficacy of gut-directed hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the impact of delivery characteristics.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Titles and abstracts, then full text articles, were screened for inclusion criteria. Studies were extracted and assessed for bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of gut-directed hypnotherapy on global IBS symptoms and pain. A sub-group analysis was conducted to assess the impact of gut-directed hypnotherapy delivery characteristics on IBS-related outcomes.
RESULTS: Twelve studies in 11 papers met inclusion criteria, involving 1158 patients with IBS. Eight studies provided continuous measures sufficient for meta-analysis. On systematic review, all 12 studies found gut-directed hypnotherapy to be superior to the comparator; nine were statistically significant. On meta-analysis, gut-directed hypnotherapy improved global IBS symptoms (SMD 0.73 [-0.09-1.55], I2 93%). Gut-directed hypnotherapy with high-volume delivery and gut-directed hypnotherapy delivered in groups showed statistically significant improvement in global IBS symptoms (SMD 0.56 [0.29-0.83], I2 0%; SMD 0.41 [0.05-0.77], I2 61%). Gut-directed hypnotherapy also significantly improved pain more than its comparator groups (SMD 0.25 [0.01-0.49], I2 17%).
CONCLUSION: Gut-directed hypnotherapy may improve global symptoms of IBS. In particular, GDH improved pain symptoms compared to other standard IBS interventions. GDH delivered in groups was effective at reducing global IBS symptoms compared to standard interventions.",Adler EC; Levine EH; Ibarra AN; Boparai ES; Hung YY; McCrary QD; Lee JK,2025,Neurogastroenterology and motility,37,7,e70037,10.1111/nmo.70037,"Adler, E.

34490319,A Low-FODMAP Diet Improves the Global Symptoms and Bowel Habits of Adult IBS Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: A low-fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet has been reported to be associated with improving the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, its efficacy as evaluated by different studies remains controversial. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to explore the efficacy of a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) in alleviating the symptoms of IBS. Methods: A search of the literature for RCTs that assessed the efficacy of an LFD in treating IBS patients was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. The searches in each database were conducted from the inception of the database to February 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations and a third reviewer resolved disagreements. Two independent reviewers also performed eligibility assessments and data extraction. The RCTs that evaluated LFDs vs. a normal IBS or usual diet and assessed changes of IBS symptoms were included in the search. Data were synthesized as the relative risk of global symptoms improvement, mean difference of IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) score, sub-items of IBS-SSS irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life (IBS-QOL), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), stool consistency/frequency, and body mass index (BMI) using a random effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2). The bias of publication was assessed based on Egger's regression analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results: A total of 2,768 citations were identified. After full-text screening, a total of 10 studies were eligible for the systematic review and were subsequently used to compare an LFD with various control interventions in 511 participants. An LFD was associated with the improvement of global symptoms [n = 420; Risk Ratio (RR) = 1.54; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.18 to 2; I 2 = 38%], improvement of stool consistency [n = 434; Mean difference (MD) = -0.25; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.06; I 2= 19%), and a reduction trend of stool frequency (n = 434; MD = -0.28; 95% CI -0.57 to 0.01; I 2 = 68%) compared with control interventions. There was no statistically significant change in IBS-QOL (n = 484; MD = 2.77; 95% CI -2 to 7.55; I 2 = 62%), anxiety score (n = 150; MD = -0.45; 95% CI -3.38 to 2.49; I 2 = 86%), depression score (n = 150; MD = -0.05; 95% CI -2.5 to 2.4; I 2 = 88%), and BMI (n = 110; MD = -0.22; 95% CI -1.89 to 1.45; I 2 = 14%). The overall quality of the data was ""moderate"" for ""global improvement of IBS symptom,"" ""stool consistency,"" ""stool consistency for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D),"" and ""stool frequency for IBS-D,"" and ""low"" or ""very low"" for other outcomes according to GRADE criteria. Conclusion: An LFD is effective in reducing the global symptoms and improving the bowel habits of adult IBS patients. The efficacy for IBS-D patients can also be more pronounced.

36757832,Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and its association with colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
METHODS: A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar from inception to 31st January 2020 without any limitations on article type or language for studies reporting data on CRC on patients with IBS. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of CRC among patients with IBS. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were eligible for data extraction and quantitative analysis. Of them, 11 were included in the meta-analysis (IBS n = 284 366, no-IBS n = 8 390 509). The pooled prevalence of CRC in patients with IBS was 0.96% (95% CI-0.184%-2.344%). The prevalence was lowest in the constipation-predominant IBS (pooled prevalence 1.126%. Patients with IBS-D and IBS-U had an equal pooled prevalence of CRC (2.49%). Eleven studies compared the prevalence of CRC in patients with IBS with a control population. The pooled OR was 2.8 (CI 2.305-3.294).
CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased risk of CRC among patients diagnosed with IBS, primarily in the first year after IBS diagnosis.

38007656,Physical Performance and Amyloid-β in Humans: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is one of the main features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Physical performance has been related to dementia risk and Aβ, and it has been hypothesized as one of the mechanisms leading to greater accumulation of Aβ. Yet, no evidence synthesis has been performed in humans.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of physical performance with Aβ in humans, including Aβ accumulation on brain, and Aβ abnormalities measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood.
METHODS: A systematic review with multilevel meta-analysis was performed from inception to June 16th, 2022. Studies were eligible if they examined the association of physical performance with Aβ levels, including the measure of physical performance as a predictor and the measure of Aβ as an outcome in humans.
RESULTS: 7 articles including 2,619 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that physical performance was not associated with accumulation of Aβ in the brain (ES = 0.01; 95% CI -0.21 to 0.24; I2 = 69.9%), in the CSF (ES = -0.28; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.41; I2 = 91.0%) or in the blood (ES = -0.19; 95% CI -0.61 to 0.24; I2 = 99.75%). Significant heterogeneity was found across the results , which posed challenges in arriving at consistent conclusions; and the limited number of studies hindered the opportunity to conduct a moderation analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between physical performance and Aβ is inconclusive. This uncertainly arises from the limited number of studies, study design limitations, and heterogeneity of measurement approaches. More studies are needed to determine whether physical performance is related to Aβ levels in humans.",Solis-Urra P; Rodriguez-Ayllon M; Álvarez-Ortega M; Molina-Hidalgo C; Molina-Garcia P; Arroyo-Ávila C; García-Hermoso A; Collins AM; Jain S; Gispert JD; Liu-Ambrose T; Ortega FB; Erickson KI; Esteban-Cornejo I,2023,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,96,4,1427-1439,10.3233/JAD-230586,"Solis-Urra, P., Rodriguez-Ayllon, M., Álvarez-Ortega, M., Molina-Hidalgo, C., Molina-Garcia, P., Arroyo-Ávila, C., García-Hermoso, A., Collins, A.

34583069,"Concentrations of bisphenols, parabens, and benzophenones in human breast milk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Breast milk is the main source of nutrition for infants but may be responsible for their exposure to environmental chemicals, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
AIM: To review available evidence on the presence and concentrations of bisphenols, parabens (PBs), and benzophenones (BPs) in human milk and to explore factors related to exposure levels.
METHODS: A systematic review was carried out using Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, conducting a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed original articles published during the period 2000-2020, including epidemiological and methodological studies. Inclusion criteria were met by 50 studies, which were compiled by calculating weighted detection frequencies and arithmetic mean concentrations of the chemicals. Their risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I checklist.
RESULTS: Among the 50 reviewed studies, concentrations of bisphenols were assessed by 37 (74.0%), PBs by 21 (42.0%), and BPs by 10 (20.0%). Weighted detection frequencies were 63.6% for bisphenol-A (BPA), 27.9-63.4% for PBs, and 39.5% for benzophenone-3 (BP-3). Weighted mean concentrations were 1.4 ng/mL for BPA, 0.2-14.2 ng/mL for PBs, and 24.4 ng/mL for BP-3. Mean concentrations ranged among studies from 0.1 to 3.9 ng/mL for BPA, 0.1 to 1063.6 ng/mL for PBs, and 0.5 to 72.4 ng/mL for BP-3. The highest concentrations of BPA and PBs were reported in samples from Asia (versus America and Europe). Higher BPA and lower methyl-paraben concentrations were observed in samples collected after 2010. Elevated concentrations of these chemicals were associated with socio-demographic and lifestyle factors in eight studies (16.0%). Two epidemiological studies showed moderate/serious risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review contributes the first overview of the widespread presence and concentrations of bisphenols, PBs, and BPs in human breast milk, revealing geographical and temporal variations. The methodological heterogeneity of published studies underscores the need for well-conducted studies to assess the magnitude of exposure to these chemicals from human milk.",Iribarne-Durán LM; Peinado FM; Freire C; Castillero-Rosales I; Artacho-Cordón F; Olea N,2022,The Science of the total environment,806,Pt 1,150437,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150437,"Iribarne-Durán, L.

37522643,Clinical Outcomes of First-line Therapies for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review of Trials Published Between 2010 and 2020.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the evolution of clinical outcomes derived from clinical trials on first-line therapies for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) published between 2010 and 2020, focusing on how these outcomes impact survival rates and management of patients.
METHODS: A systematic review of phase III and pivotal phase II clinical trials was conducted by a structured search on Medline and Embase. A comprehensive set of variables was collected to assess their influence on survival rates. We also estimated the clinical benefit by applying the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 and extracted the authors' conclusions.
RESULTS: Sixty-six studies involving 34,951 patients were included. Best survival outcomes were found for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (OS and progression-free survival medians: 19.4 and 10.2 mo) and for those expressing molecular targets (OS and progression-free survival medians: 23.8 and 11.0 mo). No significant influence on survival rates was observed for industry funding and disease stage (IIIB/IV vs. IV). ESMO-MCBS v1.1 was applied in 45 positive studies and resulted in a meaningful clinical benefit score in 37.8%. Quality of life (QoL) was reported in 57.6% of the original publications and showed statistical significance favoring the experimental arm in 33.3%. Positive authors' conclusions (75.7% of trials) were based on OS and/or QoL in 34% and on surrogate endpoints in 66%.

36091782,Systematic review and meta-analysis of Chinese herbal formula Tongxie Yaofang for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: Evidence for clinical practice and future trials.,"Introduction: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) significantly decreases the quality of life of patients and their families, and affects patients' mental health. No specific western medications are available. Ancient classical Chinese medical texts have recognized Tongxie Yaofang (TXYF) as a therapy for diarrhea which is widely used in clinical practice. Standard TXYF prescription (S-TXYF) is composed of four herbal medicines: Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. [Asteraceae; Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae.], Paeonia lactiflora Pall. [Ranunculaceae; Paeoniae Radix Alba], Citrus × aurantium L. [Rutaceae; Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium] and Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz. ex Ledeb.) Schischk. [Umbelliferae; Saposhnikoviae Radix]. This review aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of S-TXYF for IBS-D. Methods: Eight English and Chinese electronic databases were searched from their inception to 25 December 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing S-TXYF with placebo, western medications or no treatment for IBS-D. The primary outcome was the global improvement of IBS-D symptoms. Data were analyzed using Cochrane's Revman 5.4 software. Evidence certainty was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool for the primary outcome. Results: Eleven RCTs involving 985 adults with IBS-D were included. For global improvement of symptoms, S-TXYF was superior to western medication and placebo (moderate evidence by GRADE). Regarding the improvement of stool consistency, stool frequency and abdominal pain, S-TXYF was significantly effective than placebo. In addition, S-TXYF was superior to western medication on improving the quality of life and relieving anxiety. Six trials reported adverse events: five of them reported (non-serious) adverse events occurred in both groups, and one trial reported that 3 cases with adverse events (constipation, elevation in liver-enzyme, nausea) occurred in S-TXYF group and 3 cases with adverse events (abdominal distension, nausea) occurred in placebo group. Conclusion: Although current results showed that S-TXYF may have potential to treat IBS-D and its use appears to be safe, no a clear and confirmed conclusion can be drawn from our review as the overall inadequate design of the included trials reviewed. So more rigorous trials are warranted to establish confirmed evidence on its benefits and safety.",Liang SB; Cao HJ; Kong LY; Wei JL; Robinson N; Yang SH; Zhu SJ; Li YQ; Fei YT; Han M; Liu JP,2022,Frontiers in pharmacology,13,,904657,10.3389/fphar.2022.904657,"Liang, S.

38024368,"Gluten restriction in irritable bowel syndrome, yes or no?: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: More than half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) report aggravating their symptoms with certain foods. Currently, Low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols diet (LFD) is the most accepted dietary intervention for IBS. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been suggested that gluten restriction may reduce the symptoms of patients with IBS. However, the results from these studies are conflicting. This study filled this knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on IBS symptoms.
METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 2023. A random-effect model was applied to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome.
RESULTS: A total of nine controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. In contrast to gluten-containing diet, GFD was unable to reduce overall symptoms (SMD - 0.31; 95% CI -0.92, 0.31), bloating (SMD -0.37; 95% CI -1.03, 0.30), and quality of life (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.64, 0.39); but had a slight trend to reduce abdominal pain (SMD -0.68; 95% CI -1.36, -0.00). Also, LFD significantly reduced the IBS-Severity score system (SMD 0.66, 95% CI 0.31, 1.01) and improved quality of life (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.70, -0.01), compared to GFD.
CONCLUSION: A GFD is not robust enough to be routinely recommended for IBS patients, and its efficacy is significantly lower than that of an LFD. Only a certain subgroup of IBS patients may benefit from GFD; further studies are needed to target this subgroup.",Arabpour E; Alijanzadeh D; Sadeghi A; Khoshdel S; Hekmatdoost A; Kord-Varkaneh H; Abdehagh M,2023,Frontiers in nutrition,10,,1273629,10.3389/fnut.2023.1273629,"Arabpour, E., Alijanzadeh, D., Sadeghi, A., Khoshdel, S., Hekmatdoost, A., Kord-Varkaneh, H., & Abdehagh, M.

33020077,Maternal trauma due to motor vehicle crashes and pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and quantify the effect of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) in pregnancy on maternal and offspring outcomes.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational data searched from inception until 1 July 2018. Searching was from June to August 2018 in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Latin-American and Caribbean System on Health Sciences Information, Scientific Electronic Library Online, TRANSPORT, International Road Research Documentation, European Conference of Ministers of Transportation Databases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register.
PARTICIPANTS: Studies were selected if they focused on the effects of exposure MVC during pregnancy versus non-exposure, with follow-up to verify outcomes in various settings, including secondary care, collision and emergency, and inpatient care.
DATA SYNTHESIS: For incidence data, we calculated a pooled estimate per 1000 women. For comparison of outcomes between women involved and those not involved in MVC, we calculated ORs with 95% CIs. Where possible, we statistically pooled the data using the random-effects model. The quality of studies used in the comparative analysis was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: We included 19 studies (3 222 066 women) of which the majority was carried out in high-income countries (18/19). In population-level studies of women involved in MVC, maternal death occurred in 3.6 per 1000 (95% CI 0.25-10.42; 3 studies, 12 000 women; Tau=1.77), and fetal death or stillbirth in 6.6 per 1000 (95% CI 3.81-10.12; 8 studies, 47 992 women; I2=92.6%). Pooled incidence of complications per 1000 women involved in MVC was labour induction (276.43), preterm delivery (191.90) and caesarean section (166.65). Compared with women not involved in MVC, those involved had increased odds of placental abruption (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.27-1.63; 3 studies, 1 500 825 women) and maternal death (OR 202.27; 95% CI 110.60-369.95; 1 study, 1 094 559 women).
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women involved in MVC were at higher risk of maternal death and complications than those not involved.

32964596,Acute and cumulative benefits of Photobiomodulation for xerostomia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The objective was to explore the effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy for treating patients who suffer xerostomia and/or hyposalivation due to the most prevalent clinical diagnoses. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Library for randomized or clinical controlled trials published until 31 October 2019. Risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis were conducted using the Cochrane tools. A total of 274 records were retrieved, and 11 met the inclusion criteria. Interventions whose parameters ranged between wavelengths of 790-830 nm (infrared), 30-120 mW of power and an energy density below 30 J/cm-2 were associated with improvements in xerostomia/hyposalivation. As for the assessment of methodological quality, 10 of the 11 articles included had a high risk of overall bias. Only 3 articles provided sufficient information to conduct a meta-analysis for quality of life, compared with placebo in patients with burning mouth syndrome, showing a standardized mean difference between groups from baseline of -0.90 (-1.48; -0.32). The present review and meta-analysis suggest that photobiomodulation therapy is an effective, non-invasive and safe approach in patients with xerostomia. However, despite the potential, it is not possible to reach a reliable consensus on the parameters to be used, and future studies should be conducted by standardizing intervention protocols.",Galiano-Castillo N; Liu L; Lozano-Lozano M; Tumilty S; Cantarero-Villanueva I; Baxter GD,2021,Oral diseases,27,5,1115-1126,10.1111/odi.13648,"Galiano-Castillo, N., Liu, L., Lozano-Lozano, M., Tumilty, S., Cantarero-Villanueva, I., & Baxter, G.

32989183,"Parental, Perinatal, and Childhood Risk Factors for Development of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Adverse early life experiences are associated with the development of stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory and ischemic heart diseases. These negative experiences may also play a role in the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)--a functional gastrointestinal disease. This review discusses the research to date on the parental, perinatal, and childhood risk and protective factors associated with the development of IBS.
METHODS: A literature search was completed for studies published between 1966 and 2018 that investigated premorbid factors occurring during the perinatal and childhood periods as well as parental factors that were associated with the development of IBS.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the review criteria. Risk factors that appeared in more than one study included: (1) parental IBS, substance abuse, parental punishment, and rejection as parental risk factors; (2) low birth weight as a perinatal risk factor; and (3) crowded living conditions in low-income families, childhood anxiety, depression, or child abuse as childhood risk factors. Protective factors for IBS were emotional warmth from the parents and being born to an older mother.
CONCLUSIONS: More effort is needed to identify what fetal and maternal factors are associated with low birth weight and IBS. A well-executed prospective birth cohort with a collection of bio-samples and functional data will provide a better understanding of how adversity and the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and numerous risk factors affect the development of IBS.",Low EXS; Mandhari MNKA; Herndon CC; Loo EXL; Tham EH; Siah KTH,2020,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,26,4,437-446,10.5056/jnm20109,"Low, E.

36656484,Anxiety and depression in Indian patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are associated with psychological abnormalities, such as anxiety and depression. Though the data on this are plenty in global literature, Indian data are sparse. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of Indian data on anxiety and depression among patients with IBS to estimate their pooled prevalence and to identify the shortcomings so that future areas of research can be identified.
METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was performed for studies applying tests for psychological issues in patients with IBS. After applying prospectively decided exclusion criteria, the eligible papers were examined using a meta-analysis approach for the prevalence of anxiety and depression in IBS patients using different tests. The odds ratios (OR) of anxiety and depression among subjects with IBS were calculated compared to controls.
RESULTS: Of seven studies (590 IBS patients and 1520 controls) included in the meta-analysis, the pooled OR of anxiety was 8.060 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.007-16.213) as compared to controls (random-effect model). The pooled OR of depression was 7.049 (95% CI 3.281-15.147) compared to controls (random-effect model). There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies.
CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis shows that the patients with IBS from India have eightfold greater risks of anxiety and sevenfold greater risks of depression than the controls. However, most of these data were from tertiary urban centers, and hence, there might be recruitment bias over-estimating the frequency.",Ghoshal U; Biswas SN; Dixit VK; Yadav JS,2023,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,42,1,32-39,10.1007/s12664-022-01300-0,"Ghoshal, U., Biswas, S.

37451055,Colorectal cancer treatment guidelines and shared decision making quality and reporting assessment: Systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Physicians must share decisions and choose personalised treatments regarding patients ́ beliefs and values.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the quality of the recommendations about shared decision making (SDM) in colorectal (CRC) and anal cancer treatment clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and consensus statements (CSs).
METHODS: Guidelines were systematically reviewed following prospective registration (Prospero: CRD42021286146) without language restrictions searching 15 databases and 59 professional society websites from January 2010 to November 2021. A validated 31-item SDM quality assessment tool was employed to extract data in duplicate.
RESULTS: We identified 134 guidelines. Only 46/134 (34.3 %) mentioned SDM. Fifteen (11.1 %) made clear, precise and actionable recommendations, while 9/134 (6.7 %) indicated the strength of the SDM-related recommendations. CPGs underpinned by systematic reviews reported SDM more often than those based on consensus or reviews (35.9 % vs 32.0 %; p = 0.031). Guidelines that reported following quality tools (i.e., AGREE II) more commonly commented about SDM than when it was not reported (75.0 % vs 32.0 %; p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Most of the CRC and anal treatment guidelines did not mention SDM and it was superficial. Guidelines based on systematic reviews and those using quality tools demonstrated better reporting of SDM.

However, elderly Europeans cannot manage the recommended fruits and vegetables consumption. This systematic review aims to explore the main factors related to fruits and vegetables consumption in elderly Europeans. We conducted literature searches on Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to May 2022. Published articles including data related to certain fruits and vegetables consumption among elderly Europeans were selected. The New Castle-Ottawa Scale and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute tools were used for methodological quality assessment by two authors independently. A total of 60 articles were retrieved, and data from twenty-one high-quality cross-sectional studies and five moderate-to-high-quality cohort studies, including a total of 109,516 participants, were synthesized. Associated factors mostly analyzed were those relating to demographic and socioeconomic status, such as sex, age, marital status, educational level, and income. However, the findings show a high discrepancy. Some evidence suggests a possible positive association, while other evidence shows an inverse or no association at all. The relationship between demographic and socioeconomic factors with fruits and vegetables consumption is not at all clear.

39407084,Efficacy and Safety of a Low-FODMAP Diet in Combination with a Gluten-Free Diet for Adult Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Common gastrointestinal disease irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is marked by symptoms like changed bowel habits, bloating, and stomach ache. A low-FODMAP combined gluten-free diet (LF-GFD) has been suggested as a possible therapy for IBS symptoms management.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate whether a LF-GFD would help patients with IBS.
METHODS: Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria from internet databases helped to identify clinical studies evaluating the intervention of LF-GFD in the treatment of IBS patients. Using measurements including the visual analog scale (VAS) for bloating and pain, the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), and IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL), the main results evaluated were the efficacy of LF-GFD in reducing IBS symptoms. Furthermore assessed were the psychological impacts of LF-GFD utilizing the self- rating depression scale (SDS) and self- rating anxiety scale (SAS).
RESULTS: A total of 437 patients (221 on LF-GFD diet and 216 on GFD) were involved in 4 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies. The combined results indicated that LF-GFD reduced the VAS bloating ratings (RR = - 0.58, 95%CI - 0.92-0.23, P = 0.0010, I2 = 83%) and the VAS pain scores (RR = - 0.42, 95%CI - 0.66-0.19, P = 0.005, I2 = 58%). In addition, LF-GFD indicated a substantial enhancement in IBS-SSS scores (MD = - 1.42, 95%CI - 2.74-0.10, P = 0.03, I2 = 24%) and IBS-QoL ratings (MD = 3.75, 95%CI 0.98-6.53, P = 0.008, I2 = 33%). Moreover, the LF-GFD group showed a substantial drop in SDS (MD = - 2.56, 95%CI - 3.38-1.74, P < 0.00001, I2 = 65%) and SAS (MD = - 4.30, 95%CI - 6.53-2.24, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) scores compared to the GFD group.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate differences in HRQoL of those with IBS compared with healthy controls and to examine whether HRQoL improves following psychological intervention. Online databases were searched for articles from 2002 to 2017. Studies were screened and data extracted according to predetermined criteria. A total of 4,154 citations were identified from which 36 were eligible for inclusion. Eight studies compared HRQoL of those with IBS (n = 822) with that of healthy individuals (n = 3,809). Those with IBS suffered significant impairment across all HRQoL domains compared with healthy individuals, with the majority of effects (Cohen's d) being moderate to large. Twenty-eight studies investigated HRQoL in IBS following psychological intervention (n = 1,308) relative to controls (n = 1,006). All HRQoL domains improved with large effects following treatment; however, maintenance of these effects was inconsistent. Those with IBS experience poorer HRQoL than the wider community; nevertheless, psychological interventions are associated with improved HRQoL across all domains.

39057399,Fucoidan as a Promising Drug for Pain Treatment: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Fucoidan is a polymer of L-fucose and L-fucose-4-sulphate naturally found in marine sources that inhibits p-selectin, preventing neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury. Fucoidan is employed in many studies as a tool to investigate the contribution of neutrophils to pain, showing analgesic effects. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the analgesic effects of pretreatment with fucoidan reported in the available preclinical studies. In addition, we summarized the articles which have studied the therapeutic effects of fucoidan in pathological pain at preclinical and clinical levels. The results of this systematic review reveal that pretreatment with fucoidan is a powerful tool which reduces neutrophil infiltration by 70-90% at early time points. This meta-analysis showed that preventative treatment with fucoidan produced a significant pain reduction. In addition, several preclinical studies have observed that fucoidan treatment reduces the pain that is associated with various pathologies. Finally, fucoidan has also been tested in several clinical trials, with some degree of analgesic efficacy, but they were mostly small pilot studies. Considering all the above information, it can be concluded that fucoidan is not only a preclinical tool for studying the role of neutrophils in pain but also a promising therapeutic strategy for pain treatment.",Huerta MÁ; Tejada MÁ; Nieto FR,2024,Marine drugs,22,7,,10.3390/md22070290,"Huerta, M.

39777150,Meta-analysis of gut microbiota alterations in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic disorder of gastrointestinal function with a high prevalence worldwide. Due to its complex pathogenesis and heterogeneity, there is urrently no consensus in IBS research.
METHODS: We collected and uniformly reanalyzed 1167 fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing samples (623 from IBS patients and 544 from healthy subjects) from 9 studies. Using both a random effects (RE) model and a fixed effects (FE) model, we calculated the odds ratios for metrics including bacterial alpha diversity, beta diversity, common genera and pathways between the IBS and control groups.
RESULTS: Significantly lower alpha-diversity indexes were observed in IBS patients by random effects model. Twenty-six bacterial genera and twelve predicted pathways were identified with significant odds ratios and classification potentials for IBS patients. Based on these feature, we used transfer learning to enhance the predictive capabilities of our model, which improved model performance by approximately 10%. Moreover, through correlation network analysis, we found that Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae were negatively correlated with vitamin B6 metabolism, which was decreased in the patients with IBS. Ruminococcaceae was also negatively correlated with tyrosine metabolism, which was decreased in the patients with IBS.
DISCUSSION: This study revealed the dysbiosis of fecal bacterial diversity, composition, and predicted pathways of patients with IBS by meta-analysis and identified universal biomarkers for IBS prediction and therapeutic targets.",Li X; Li X; Xiao H; Xu J; He J; Xiao C; Zhang B; Cao M; Hong W,2024,Frontiers in microbiology,15,,1492349,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1492349,"Li, X., Li, X., Xiao, H., Xu, J., He, J., Xiao, C., Zhang, B., Cao, M., & Hong, W.

To avoid the virus transmission, healthcare workers must wear adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE is associated with several side events, including skin reactions. The objective of this study was to summarize the prevalence, type and risk factors for cutaneous adverse events related to PPE and prevention measures to avoid them. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using MEDLINE, Scopus and EMBASE databases from conception to 21 January 2021. All types of epidemiological studies regarding skin adverse events related to PPE were included. The literature search identified 1007 references, 35 of them met the eligible criteria and were included for analysis, representing 31 453 participants. The media of skin side events related to PPE was 75.13%. The rate of cutaneous adverse events related to mask was 57.71%, and those associated with gloves and hand hygiene products was 49.16%. Most common skin adverse events were contact dermatitis, acne and itching. The most damaged anatomical regions were the nasal bridge, the cheeks and the hands. The duration of PPE wearing was the most common risk factor. Frequent handwashing, gloves and masks were the agents most frequently related to skin reactions. N95 respirators were the most harmful mask type for the skin. Hydrocolloid use prevented from developing skin adverse events related to masks. In conclusion, the rate of cutaneous adverse events related to PPE use is high. A longer duration of PPE wearing was the most common risk factor.

35851070,A systematic review and meta-analysis of weight loss in control group participants of lifestyle randomized trials.,"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of lifestyle modification have reported beneficial effects of interventions, compared to control. Whether participation in the control group has benefits is unknown. To determine whether control group participants experience weight loss during the course of RCTs. After prospective registration (PROSPERO CRD42021233070), we conducted searches in Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library and Clinicaltrials.gov databases from inception to May 2021 without language restriction to capture RCTs on dietary advice or physical activity interventions in adults with overweight, obesity or metabolic syndrome. Data extraction and study quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers. Weight loss in the control group, i.e., the difference between baseline and post-intervention, was pooled using random effects model generating mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistical test. Subgroup meta-analysis was performed stratifying by follow-up period, type of control group protocols and high-quality studies. Among the 22 included studies (4032 participants), the risk of bias was low in 9 (40%) studies. Overall, the controls groups experienced weight loss of - 0.41 kg (95% CI - 0.53 to - 0.28; I2 = 73.5% p < 0.001). To identify a result that is an outlier, we inspected the forest plot for spread of the point estimates and the confidence intervals. The magnitude of the benefit was related to the duration of follow-up (- 0.51 kg, 95% CI - 0.68, - 0.3, for 1-4 months follow-up; - 0.32 kg, 95% CI - 0.58, - 0.07, 5-12 months; - 0.20 kg, 95% CI - 0.49, 0.10, ≥ 12 months). In high-quality studies we found an overall weight loss mean difference of - 0.16 (95% CI - 0.39, 0.09) with a considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 74%; p < 0.000). Among studies including control group in waiting lists and combining standard care, advice and material, no heterogeneity was found (I2 = 0%, p = 0.589) and (I2 = 0%, p = 0.438); and the mean difference was - 0.84 kg (95% CI - 2.47, 0.80) and - 0.65 kg (95% CI - 1.03, - 0.27) respectively. Participation in control groups of RCTs of lifestyle interventions had a benefit in terms of weight loss in meta-analysis with heterogeneity. These results should be used to interpret the benefits observed with respect to intervention effect in trials. That control groups accrue benefits should be included in patient information sheets to encourage participation in future trials among patients with overweight and obesity.",Bouzalmate Hajjaj A; Massó Guijarro P; Khan KS; Bueno-Cavanillas A; Cano-Ibáñez N,2022,Scientific reports,12,1,12252,10.1038/s41598-022-15770-x,"Bouzalmate Hajjaj, A., Massó Guijarro, P., Khan, K.

34203872,Effect of Periodic Vehicle Inspection on Road Crashes and Injuries: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review was conducted to determine the effect of periodic motor vehicle inspections on road crashes and injuries, compared to less exposure to periodic inspections or no inspections. The Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were used to search the literature. Ecological studies were specifically excluded. A reverse search of the results with these databases and of other identified narrative reviews was also performed. Of the 5065 unique references initially extracted, only six of them met the inclusion criteria and were selected for review: one experimental study, two cohort studies with an internal comparison group, two cohort studies without a comparison group, and one case-control study. Two authors independently extracted the information and assessed the quality of each study. Due to the heterogeneity of the designs and the intervention or comparison groups used, quantitative synthesis of the results was not attempted. Except for the case-control study, which showed a significant association between road crashes and the absence of a valid vehicle inspection certificate, the other studies showed either a small reduction in crash rates (around 9%), no association, or a higher crash rate in vehicles with more inspections. In all observational studies, the risk of residual confounding bias was significant and could have explained the results. Therefore, although the research reviewed here suggests that periodic inspection may be associated with a slight reduction in road crashes, the marked heterogeneity along with probable residual confounding in most reports prevented us from establishing causality for this association.",Martín-delosReyes LM; Lardelli-Claret P; García-Cuerva L; Rivera-Izquierdo M; Jiménez-Mejías E; Martínez-Ruiz V,2021,International journal of environmental research and public health,18,12,,10.3390/ijerph18126476,"Martín-delosReyes, L.

38373643,Using interbrain synchrony to study teamwork: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"It has been proposed that interbrain synchrony (IBS) may help to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning teamwork. As hyperscanning studies have provided abundant findings on IBS in team environments, the current review aims to synthesize the findings of hyperscanning studies in a way that is relevant to the teamwork research. A systematic review was conducted. Included studies were classified according to the IPO (i.e. input, process, output) model of teamwork. Three multi-level meta-analyses were performed to quantify the associations between IBS and the three IPO variables. The methodology followed PRISMA guidelines and the protocol was pre-registered (https://osf.io/7h8sa/). Of the 229 studies, 41 were included, representing 1326 teams. The three meta-analyses found statistically significant positive effects, indicating a positive association between IBS and the three IPO teamwork variables. This study provides evidence that IBS is a relevant measure of the teamwork process and argues for the continued use of IBS to study teamwork.",Réveillé C; Vergotte G; Perrey S; Bosselut G,2024,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,159,,105593,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2024.105593,"Réveillé, C., Vergotte, G., Perrey, S., & Bosselut, G.

31987249,Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
DESIGN: A computer-based search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, GreenFILE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. A hand-search of the bibliographies of relevant papers and previous meta-analyses and reviews was also undertaken. Trials were included in the review if they were double-blind and placebo-controlled investigating the effects of Western herbal medicines on IBS-related symptoms or quality of life. There were no language restrictions. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. For herbal medicines where there was more than 1 trial of similar design, data were synthesised using relative risk of symptoms improving using the random effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty-three trials were identified that met all eligibility criteria. Seventeen of these evaluated peppermint essential oil, fifteen other Western herbal medicines, and one trial evaluated peppermint oil in one arm and aniseed essential oil in the other arm. Eighteen different herbal preparations were evaluated in these trials. Data suggests that a number of Western herbal medicines may provide relief of IBS symptoms. Meta-analyses suggest that peppermint essential oil is both efficacious and well-tolerated in the short-term management of IBS. Aloe vera and asafoetida also demonstrated efficacy in reducing global IBS symptoms in meta-analyses. The herbal formulas STW 5, STW 5-II and Carmint, along with Ferula assa-foetida, Pimpenella anisum oil, the combination of Curcumin and Foeniculum vulgare oil, and the blend of Schinopsis lorentzii, Aesculus hippocastanum, and peppermint essential oil also demonstrated efficacy in rigorously-designed clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: A number of Western herbal medicines show promise in the treatment of IBS. With the exception of peppermint essential oil, Aloe vera, and asafoetida, however, none of the positive trials have been replicated. This lack of replication limits the capacity to make definitive statements of efficacy for these herbal medicines.",Hawrelak JA; Wohlmuth H; Pattinson M; Myers SP; Goldenberg JZ; Harnett J; Cooley K; Van De Venter C; Reid R; Whitten DL,2020,Complementary therapies in medicine,48,,102233,10.1016/j.ctim.2019.102233,"Hawrelak, J.

32473396,Psychological and cognitive factors related to prehospital delay in acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: In acute coronary syndrome the time elapsed between the start of symptoms and the moment the patient receives treatment is an important determinant of survival and subsequent recovery. However, many patients do not receive treatment as quickly as recommended, mostly due to substantial prehospital delays such as waiting to seek medical attention after symptoms have started.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of the relationship between nine frequently investigated psychological and cognitive factors and prehospital delay.
DESIGN: A protocol was preregistered in PROSPERO [CRD42018094198] and a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines.
DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched for quantitative articles published between 1997 and 2019: Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, Psych Info, PAIS, and Open grey.
REVIEW METHODS: Study risk of bias was assessed with the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational, Cohort, and Cross-Sectional Studies. A best evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the findings of the included studies.
RESULTS: Forty-eight articles, reporting on 57 studies from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies used very diverse definitions of prehospital delay and analytical practices, which precluded meta-analysis. The best evidence synthesis indicated that there was evidence that patients who attributed their symptoms to a cardiac event (n = 37), perceived symptoms as serious (n = 24), or felt anxiety in response to symptoms (n = 15) reported shorter prehospital delay, with effect sizes indicating important clinical differences (e.g., 1.5-2 h shorter prehospital delay). In contrast, there was limited evidence for a relationship between prehospital delay and knowledge of symptoms (n = 18), concern for troubling others (n = 18), fear (n = 17), or embarrassment in asking for help (n = 14).
CONCLUSIONS: The current review shows that symptom attribution to cardiac events and some degree of perceived threat are fundamental to speed up help-seeking. In contrast, social concerns and barriers in seeking medical attention (embarrassment or concern for troubling others) may not be as important as initially thought. The current review also shows that the use of very diverse methodological practices strongly limits the integration of evidence into meaningful recommendations. We conclude that there is urgent need for common guidelines for prehospital delay study design and reporting.",Arrebola-Moreno M; Petrova D; Garcia-Retamero R; Rivera-López R; Jordan-Martínez L; Arrebola JP; Ramírez-Hernández JA; Catena A,2020,International journal of nursing studies,108,,103613,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103613,"Arrebola-Moreno, M., Petrova, D., Garcia-Retamero, R., Rivera-López, R., Jordan-Martínez, L., Arrebola, J.

35807868,Evaluating the Efficacy of Probiotics in IBS Treatment Using a Systematic Review of Clinical Trials and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.,"The evaluation of probiotics' efficacy in treating irritable bowel syndrome is supported by an increasing number of clinical studies based on a heterogeneous approach of products tested and the patient cohort involved. Although the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in IBS pathogenesis and the beneficial contribution of probiotics were demonstrated, a tool to discriminate symptom-specific strains and a personalised medicine protocol are still lacking. Thus, this study employs, for the first time, a method that combines the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis methods in a structured decision-making tool to analyze the efficacy of probiotic mix, in order to identify the most effective formulation and to discriminate which probiotics are more efficient in treating different symptoms. The PRISMA methodology resulted in a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 104 clinical studies from 2011 to 2021, revealing a prevalence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis. MCDA analysis showed that formulations based on Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus have the highest efficacy, especially on quality of life, bloating, and abdominal pain. This methodological approach could become more specific by modelling clinical studies according to the age and gender of patients and probiotic strain.",Ceccherini C; Daniotti S; Bearzi C; Re I,2022,Nutrients,14,13,,10.3390/nu14132689,"Ceccherini, C., Daniotti, S., Bearzi, C., & Re, I.

38334885,A Systematic Review on the Genetic Contribution to Tinnitus.,"PURPOSE: To assess the available evidence to support a genetic contribution and define the role of common and rare variants in tinnitus.
METHODS: After a systematic search and quality assessment, 31 records including 383,063 patients were selected (14 epidemiological studies and 17 genetic association studies). General information on the sample size, age, sex, tinnitus prevalence, severe tinnitus distribution, and sensorineural hearing loss was retrieved. Studies that did not include data on hearing assessment were excluded. Relative frequencies were used for qualitative variables to compare different studies and to obtain average values. Genetic variants and genes were listed and clustered according to their potential role in tinnitus development.
RESULTS: The average prevalence of tinnitus estimated from population-based studies was 26.3% for any tinnitus, and 20% of patients with tinnitus reported it as an annoying symptom. One study has reported population-specific differences in the prevalence of tinnitus, the white ancestry being the population with a higher prevalence. Genome-wide association studies have identified and replicated two common variants in the Chinese population (rs2846071; rs4149577) in the intron of TNFRSF1A, associated with noise-induced tinnitus. Moreover, gene burden analyses in sequencing data from Spanish and Swede patients with severe tinnitus have identified and replicated ANK2, AKAP9, and TSC2 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The genetic contribution to tinnitus is starting to be revealed and it shows population-specific effects in European and Asian populations. The common allelic variants associated with tinnitus that showed replication are associated with noise-induced tinnitus. Although severe tinnitus has been associated with rare variants with large effect, their role on hearing or hyperacusis has not been established.",Perez-Carpena P; Lopez-Escamez JA; Gallego-Martinez Á,2024,Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology : JARO,25,1,13-33,10.1007/s10162-024-00925-6,"Perez-Carpena, P., Lopez-Escamez, J.

40258375,Efficacy of gut-brain neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gut-brain neuromodulators might be efficacious for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but there has been no synthesis of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of some drug classes, and whether they have pain-modifying properties in IBS is unclear. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs examining these questions.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (from Jan 1, 1946, to Jan 1, 2025), Embase and Embase Classic (from Jan 1, 1947, to Jan 1, 2025), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from database inception to Jan 1, 2025). Trials recruiting adults with IBS and that compared gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo over at least 4 weeks of treatment were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled using a random effects model to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95% CI.
FINDINGS: The search strategy identified 3625 citations. 28 RCTs were eligible containing 2475 patients. Ten RCTs were identified since our previous meta-analysis, containing 1348 patients. The RR of global IBS symptoms not improving with gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo in 22 RCTs (2222 patients) was 0·77 (95% CI 0·69-0·87). The best evidence in terms of persistence of global IBS symptoms was for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in 11 trials (1144 patients; RR 0·70, 0·62-0·80). The RR of abdominal pain not improving with gut-brain neuromodulators versus placebo in 19 RCTs (1792 patients) was 0·72 (95% CI 0·62-0·83). The best evidence was for TCAs in seven trials (708 patients; RR 0·69, 0·54-0·87), but there was also a benefit of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in seven RCTs (324 patients; RR 0·74, 0·56-0·99), and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in two trials (94 patients; RR 0·22, 0·08-0·59). Adverse events were not significantly more common with gut-brain neuromodulators, although rates of withdrawal due to adverse events were significantly higher. The certainty in the evidence for tricyclic antidepressants for global IBS symptoms was moderate, but it was low to very low for all other endpoints and drug classes studied.
INTERPRETATION: Some gut-brain neuromodulators are efficacious in reducing global symptoms and abdominal pain in IBS. The findings support guidelines that recommend use of tricyclic antidepressants for ongoing global symptoms or abdominal pain but also highlight a potential for SSRIs to be modestly effective for abdominal pain. More data for SNRIs, azapirones, and tetracyclic antidepressants in IBS are required.

39393665,P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors inhibition produces a consistent analgesic efficacy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies.,"BACKGROUND: P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors are promising therapeutic targets for pain treatment and selective inhibitors are under evaluation in ongoing clinical trials. Here we aim to consolidate and quantitatively evaluate the preclinical evidence on P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors inhibitors for pain treatment.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus and Web-of-Science on August 5, 2023. Data was extracted and meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate the analgesic efficacy of the intervention; then several subgroup analyses were performed.
RESULTS: 67 articles were included. The intervention induced a consistent pain reduction (66.5 [CI95% = 58.5, 74.5]; p < 0.0001), which was highest for visceral pain (114.3), followed by muscle (79.8) and neuropathic pain (71.1), but lower for cancer (64.1), joint (57.5) and inflammatory pain (49.0). Further analysis showed a greater effect for mechanical hypersensitivity (70.4) compared to heat hypersensitivity (64.5) and pain-related behavior (54.1). Sex (male or female) or interspecies (mice or rats) differences were not appreciated (p > 0.05). The most used molecule was A-317491, but other such as gefapixant or eliapixant were also effective (p < 0.0001 for all). The analgesic effect was higher for systemic or peripheral administration than for intrathecal administration. Conversely, intracerebroventricular administration was not analgesic, but potentiated pain.
CONCLUSION: P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptor inhibitors showed a good analgesic efficacy in preclinical studies, which was dependent on the pain etiology, pain outcome measured, the drug used and its route of administration. Further research is needed to assess the clinical utility of these preclinical findings.

37823411,Systematic review with meta-analysis: Diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome in adults.,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often overlap with those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing patients with IBD from those with IBS METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases up to 1 January 2023. Studies were included if they assessed the diagnostic performance of faecal calprotectin in distinguishing IBD from IBS (defined according to the Rome criteria) using colonoscopy with histology or radiology as reference standard in adults. We calculated summary sensitivity and specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effect bivariate model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies II.
RESULTS: We included 17 studies with a total of 1956 patients. The summary sensitivity was 85.8% (95% CI: 78.3-91), and the specificity was 91.7% (95% CI: 84.5-95.7). At a prevalence of IBD of 1%, the negative predictive value was 99.8%, while the positive predictive value was only 9%. Subgroup analyses showed a higher sensitivity in Western than in Eastern countries (88% vs 73%) and at a cut-off of ≤50 μg/g than at >50 μg/g (87% vs. 79%), with similar estimates of specificity. All studies were at ""high"" or ""unclear"" risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin is a reliable test in distinguishing patients with IBD from those with IBS.

A possible association with Fusobacterium nucleatum may provide opportunities for an early diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To review studies that address the association between F. nucleatum and CRC.
METHODS: The MEDLINE PubMed database was searched using the terms «colorectal cancer» and ""Fusobacterium nucleatum"", retrieving publications published up to January 1 2020. Stata software was used for a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The systematic review included 57 articles. Meta-analysis results indicated a more frequent presence of F. nucleatum in CRC tumour tissue samples in comparison to control samples of healthy tissue, with an odds ratio of 4.558 (95% CI: 3.312-6.272), and in comparison, to control samples of colorectal adenomas, with an odds ratio of 3.244 (95 % CI: 2.359-4.462).

33383293,The Prevalence of Psychiatric and Chronic Pain Comorbidities in Fibromyalgia: an ACTTION systematic review.,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain condition that overlaps with multiple comorbid health conditions and contributes to considerable patient distress. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview of psychiatric and chronic pain comorbidities among patients diagnosed with FM and to inform the development of recommendations for the design of clinical trials. Thirty-one, cross-sectional, clinical epidemiology studies that evaluated patients diagnosed with FM were included for review. None of the reviewed studies reported on the incidence of these comorbidities. Sample size-weighted prevalence estimates were calculated when prevalence data were reported in 2 or more studies for the same comorbid condition. The most prevalent comorbidity across all studies reviewed was depression/major depressive disorder (MDD) with over half of the patients included having this diagnosis in their lifetime (weighted prevalence up to 63%). In addition, nearly one-third of FM patients examined had current or lifetime bipolar disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Less common psychiatric disorders reported included generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and specific phobias (agoraphobia, social phobia). There were fewer studies that examined chronic pain comorbidities among FM patients, but when evaluated, prevalence was also high ranging from 39% to 76% (i.e., chronic tension-type or migraine headache, irritable bowel syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, and temporomandibular disorders). The results of the review suggest that depression and chronic pain conditions involving head/jaw pain and IBS were elevated among FM patients compared to other conditions in the clinic-based studies. In contrast, anxiety-related disorders were much less common. Addressing the presence of these comorbid health conditions in clinical trials of treatments for FM would increase the generalizability and real-world applicability of FM research.",Kleykamp BA; Ferguson MC; McNicol E; Bixho I; Arnold LM; Edwards RR; Fillingim R; Grol-Prokopczyk H; Turk DC; Dworkin RH,2021,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,51,1,166-174,10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.10.006,"Kleykamp, B.

32858405,Quality and reporting of clinical guidelines for breast cancer treatment: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: High-quality, well-reported clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and consensus statements (CSs) underpinned by systematic reviews are needed. We appraised the quality and reporting of CPGs and CSs for breast cancer (BC) treatment.
METHODS: Following protocol registration (Prospero no: CRD42020164801), CPGs and CSs on BC treatment were identified, without language restrictions, through a systematic search of bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, CDSR) and online sources (12 guideline databases and 51 professional society websites) from January 2017 to June 2020. Data were extracted in duplicate assessing overall quality using AGREE II (% of maximum score) and reporting compliance using RIGHT (% of total 35 items); reviewer agreement was 98% and 96% respectively.
RESULTS: There were 59 relevant guidance documents (43 CPGs, 16 CSs), of which 20 used systematic reviews for evidence synthesis. The median overall quality was 54.0% (IQR 35.9-74.3) and the median overall reporting compliance was 60.9% (IQR 44.5-84.4). The correlation between quality and reporting was 0.9. Compared to CSs, CPGs had better quality (55.4% vs 44.2%; p = 0.032) and reporting (67.18% vs 44.5%; p = 0.005). Compared to subjective methods of evidence analysis, guidance documents that used systematic reviews had better quality (76.3% vs 51.4%; p = 0.001) and reporting (87.1% vs 59.4%; p = 0.001).

34236740,Current status of fecal microbiota transplantation for irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal functional disorder. Although IBS is a benign condition, it reduces the quality of life considerably. While there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems to be promising.
PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to analysis possible factors affecting the success or failure of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of FMT for IBS and highlighting the gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled and of sketching a possible model for successful FMT in IBS patients.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of literature published in English from January 2015 to December 2020 using the keywords: fecal microbiota transplantation, randomized trials, and IBS.
KEY RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of FMT for IBS were found in the literature. Four of the seven RCTs found various positive effects, while the other three did not find any effect.
CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: The efficacy of FMT for IBS appears to be donor-dependent. The effective (super) donor would need to have a favorable microbiota signature, and 11 clinical criteria that are known to be associated with a favorable microbiota have been suggested for selecting FMT donors for IBS. Comparing the microbiota of the effective donors with those of healthy subjects would reveal the favorable microbiota signature required for a super-donor. However, the studies reviewed were not designed to compare efficacy of different donor types. The dose of the fecal transplant is also an important factor influencing the outcome of FMT for IBS. However, further studies designed to test the effect of fecal transplant dose are needed to answer this question. Administering the fecal transplant to either the small or large intestine seems to be effective, but the optimal route of administration remains to be determined. Moreover, whether single or repeated FMT is more effective is also still unclear.

38102564,Subtyping irritable bowel syndrome using cluster analysis: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms. Some researchers have used cluster analysis (CA), a group of non-supervised learning methods that identifies homogenous clusters within different entities based on their similarity.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This literature review aims to identify published articles that apply CA to IBS patients. We searched relevant keywords in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. We reviewed studies in terms of the selected variables, participants' characteristics, data collection, methodology, number of clusters, clusters' profiles, and results.
RESULTS: Among the 14 articles focused on the heterogeneity of IBS, eight of them utilized K-means Cluster Analysis (K-means CA), four employed Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, and only two studies utilized Latent Class Analysis. Seven studies focused on clinical symptoms, while four articles examined anocolorectal functions. Two studies were centered around immunological findings, and only one study explored microbial composition. The number of clusters obtained ranged from two to seven, showing variation across the studies. Males exhibited lower symptom severity and fewer psychological findings. The association between symptom severity and rectal perception suggests that altered rectal perception serves as a biological indicator of IBS. Ultra-slow waves observed in IBS patients are linked to increased activity of the anal sphincter, higher anal pressure, dystonia, and dyschezia.
CONCLUSION: IBS has different subgroups based on different factors. Most IBS patients have low clinical severity, good QoL, high rectal sensitivity, delayed left colon transit time, increased systemic cytokines, and changes in microbial composition, including increased Firmicutes-associated taxa and depleted Bacteroidetes-related taxa. However, the number of clusters is inconsistent across studies due to the methodological heterogeneity. CA, a valuable non-supervised learning method, is sensitive to hyperparameters like the number of clusters and random initialization of cluster centers. The random nature of these parameters leads to diverse outcomes even with the same algorithm. This has implications for future research and practical applications, necessitating further studies to improve our understanding of IBS and develop personalized treatments.",Zarei D; Saghazadeh A; Rezaei N,2023,BMC bioinformatics,24,1,478,10.1186/s12859-023-05567-8,"Zarei, D., Saghazadeh, A., & Rezaei, N.

34729835,Systematic review of the effect of aquatic therapeutic exercise in breast cancer survivors.,"BACKGROUND: Aquatic therapeutic exercise can be equally effective or even superior to land-based exercise in improving several clinical variables. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the effects compared to land-based interventions particularly in breast cancer (BC) patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effects of aquatic therapeutic exercise on pain, shoulder mobility, lymphedema, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition, pulmonary function, cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and which parameters are effective compared to similar land-based interventions.
METHODS: The databases used were PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and CINAHL, retrieving 145 articles.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. Aquatic therapeutic exercise is feasible, safe, well tolerated and achieved high percentages of adherence. As for the assessed outcomes, moderate to large improvements were found compared to usual care or to land-based physical exercise interventions in pain, shoulder range of motion, pulmonary function, HRQoL, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength. Inconclusive results were found for lymphedema, body composition and CRF.
CONCLUSIONS: Aquatic therapeutic exercise interventions using a combination of endurance, strength, mobility, stretching and breathing exercises resulted in improvements in common side effects of BC and its treatments. More studies on CRF, body composition and lymphedema need to be done to further evaluate the impact of the intervention on these outcomes.",Mur-Gimeno E; Postigo-Martin P; Cantarero-Villanueva I; Sebio-Garcia R,2022,European journal of cancer care,31,1,e13535,10.1111/ecc.13535,"Mur-Gimeno, E., Postigo-Martin, P., Cantarero-Villanueva, I., & Sebio-Garcia, R.

37035662,Effect of exercise on bone health in children and adolescents with cancer during and after oncological treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Although regular physical activity and exercise programs might improve bone health caused by oncological treatment and the disease itself, it remains unknown the pooled effect of exercise interventions following frequency, intensity, time and type prescriptions. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise evidence regarding the effectiveness of exercise interventions on bone health in children and adolescents with cancer during and after oncological treatment. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science and Scopus databases from November 2021 to January 2022. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs reporting pre-post changes of the effectiveness of exercise interventions on DXA-measured bone parameters in young population (1-19 years) during or after oncological treatment were included. Pooled (ESs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Results: A total of eight trials with 341 participants were included. The meta-analyses did not reveal a statistically significant increase in whole body areal bone mineral density (ES = 0.10; 95%CI: -0.14, 0.34), lumbar spine (ES = 0.03; 95%CI: -0.21, 0.26) or femoral neck (ES = 0.10; 95%CI: -0.37, 0.56). Similarly, during the oncological treatment phase the ES was 0.04 (95%CI: -0.17, 0.25) and after the ES was 0.07 (95%CI: -0.20, 0.33).

35830045,A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS IN SCHOOLCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS ACCORDING TO ROME IV CRITERIA.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in children according to Rome IV criteria.
METHODS: We included cohorts and observational descriptive studies, including information for the prevalence of FGIDs according to Rome IV criteria in children 4 to 18 years old. We searched the MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL databases from May 2016 to nowadays. Gray literature and other databases were also consulted. The risk of bias was assessed using the STROBE Statement. The results were reported in forest plots of the estimated effects of the included studies with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
RESULTS: We included 14 studies involving a total of 17427 participants. Three studies were conducted in Europe, two in North America, and nine in Latin America. Most studies were school-based (n=14670, 84.18%), participants were mostly female (55.49%), white (51.73%), 8 to 18 years old (77.64%), and assisted to a public school (81.53%). Thirteen studies used the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS-RIV) to assess FGIDs. We found a global prevalence for FGIDs of 23% (95%CI 21-25%, I2 99%). Main disorders were functional constipation (FC) with 12% (95%CI 11-15%) followed by functional dyspepsia (FD) (5%, 95%CI 11-15%) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (3%, 95%CI 2-4%). The prevalence of FGIDs was higher in the Americas, representing 23.67% (95%CI 21.2-26.2%, I2 91.3%).
CONCLUSION: FGIDs are present in one of four children and adolescents, representing a common condition in this age group the central disorders were FC, FD, and IBS.",Velasco-Benítez CA; Collazos-Saa LI; García-Perdomo HA,2022,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,59,2,304-313,10.1590/S0004-2803.202202000-53,"Velasco-Benítez, C.

33010814,Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often report symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which might have an effect on psychological health. However, previous estimates of the magnitude of this issue have not accounted for ongoing inflammation as the potential cause. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis to determine prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in patients with IBD in remission to better quantify the magnitude of this issue.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, Embase, Embase Classic, and MEDLINE were searched (from Jan 1, 2012, to May 11, 2020) to identify prospective case-control or cross-sectional studies reporting prevalence of symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for IBS in adults with IBD in remission. Studies were required to have recruited an unselected adult population (more than 90% of participants aged ≥16 years) with histologically or radiologically confirmed IBD and include at least 50 participants. Pooled prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated according to the definition of remission, criteria used to define IBS-type symptoms, and type of IBD. The association between IBS-type symptom reporting and psychological comorbidity was examined using weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) in anxiety and depression scores between those reporting IBS-type symptoms and those not, for cases in which these data were available.
FINDINGS: Of 3370 studies identified, 27 were eligible, of which 18 were newly identified. Among 3169 patients with IBD in remission, pooled prevalence of IBS-type symptoms was 32·5% (95% CI 27·4-37·9; I2=90·1%). Prevalence was lower when remission was defined by endoscopic assessment (23·5%, 95% CI 17·9-29·6; I2=59·9%) or histological assessment (25.8%, 95% CI 20.2-31.7; I2=not applicable) than when defined by validated clinical disease activity index (33·6%, 26·3-41·2; I2=91·8%) and higher in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis (36·6%, 29·5-44·0; I2=82·9% vs 28·7%, 22·9-34·8; I2=87·2%). Anxiety (WMD 2·5; 95% CI 0·8-4·3) and depression (SMD 0·64; 0·44-0·84) scores were significantly higher among those who reported IBS-type symptoms than in those who did not.
INTERPRETATION: Prevalence of symptoms compatible with IBS in patients with IBD varied according to how remission was defined. However, even when stringent criteria such as endoscopic or histological remission were used, about a quarter of patients reported these symptoms. Such symptoms were more common in patients with Crohn's disease and were associated with psychological comorbidity. Addressing psychological wellbeing might improve outcomes in this specific group of patients.

37512012,COVID-19 and the Use of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers in Older Chronic Hypertensive Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and selective angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARAIIs) are widely used antihypertensive agents. Their use has generated controversy due to their possible influence on the health status of chronic patients infected with COVID-19. The objective of this work is to analyze the influence of COVID-19 on chronic hypertensive patients treated with ACEI and ARAII inhibitors. A systematic review and meta-analysis in the databases Pubmed, Pro-Quest and Scopus were carried out. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search equation descriptors were obtained from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus. The search equation was: ""Older AND hypertension AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus) AND primary care"" and its equivalent in Spanish. Nineteen articles were obtained, with n = 10,806,159 subjects. Several studies describe the COVID-19 association with ACEI or ARAII treatment in hypertension patients as a protective factor, some as a risk factor, and others without a risk association. In the case of ACEI vs. ARAII, the risk described for the former has an odds ratio (OR) of 0.55, and for ARAII, an OR of 0.59. Some authors talk about mortality associated with COVID-19 and ACEI with a half ratio (HR) of 0.97, and also associated ARAIIs with an HR of 0.98.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is transferring the fecal bacteria and other microorganisms from a healthy person to another. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of FMT in treating IBS patients. We searched Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases through June 2021 using relevant key words. We included 19 studies. Fecal microbiota transplantation was significantly superior to placebo in IBS quality of life after 4 weeks (mean difference [MD] = 7.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-12.89, p = .04), 12 weeks (MD = 9.99, 95% CI: 5.78-14.19, p < .00001), and 24 weeks (MD = 8.49, 95% CI: 0.47-16.52, p = .04), with no difference regarding IBS improvement symptoms and the IBS Severity Scoring System (SSS). Single-arm analysis revealed that the incidence of improvement of IBS symptoms was 57.8% (45.6%-69.9%) with reduction in IBS-SSS (MD = -74, 95% CI: -101.7 to -46.3). Fecal microbiota transplantation was superior to placebo in improving quality of life after 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Also, FMT improved IBS symptoms and reduced the IBS-SSS score.

36216967,Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Changes applied to the Prostate cancer (PCa) histopathology grading, where patients with cribriform patterns (CP) may be categorized as grade group 2 and could hypothetically be surveilled. However, CP has been associated with worse oncological outcomes. The aim of our study is to systematically review and meta-analyze the available evidence on CP in PCa patients.
METHODS: This analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022298473). We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexes, keyword searches, and publication types until December 2021. The search terms included: ""prostate"", ""prostate cancer"" and ""cribriform"". We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. Eligible studies included published journal articles that provided quantitative data on the association between cribriform patterns at radical prostatectomy and the presence of extra-prostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), positive surgical margins (PSM), biochemical recurrence (BCR) or cancer specific mortality (CSM).
RESULTS: Overall, 31 studies were included for the quantitative analysis. All articles have been published during a span of 11 years (2011-2022) with a mean month of follow-up of 62.87 months. The mean quality of these studies, assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was 6.27. We demonstrated that CP was associated with greater risk of EPE (odds ratio [OR] 1.96; P < 0.0001), SVI (OR: 2.89; p < 0.01), and PSM (OR: 1.88; p < 0.0007). Our analyses showed that CP was associated with greater risk of BCR (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.14; p < 0.01) and of CSM (HR: 3.30, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The presence of CP is associated with adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy and worse biochemical recurrence and cancer specific mortality. These results highlight the importance of a better pathologic report of CP to advise clinician for a strict follow-up in PCa patients.",Russo GI; Soeterik T; Puche-Sanz I; Broggi G; Lo Giudice A; De Nunzio C; Lombardo R; Marra G; Gandaglia G,2023,Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,26,4,646-654,10.1038/s41391-022-00600-y,"Russo, G.

32961342,Potential Benefit With Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may pursue complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining efficacy of CAM vs. placebo or sham in adults with IBS.
METHODS: Publication databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of CAM therapies (herbal therapy, dietary supplements, mind-body based, body-based, and energy-healing) in adults with IBS. Data were extracted to obtain pooled estimates of mean improvement in abdominal pain (standardized mean difference [SMD]) and relative risk (RR) of overall response using random effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses along with quality assessments were completed.
RESULTS: Among 2825 articles identified, 66 were included. Herbal therapy (SMD=0.47, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.75, I2=82%) demonstrated significant benefit over placebo for abdominal pain (low confidence in estimates). Benefit with mind-body based therapy for abdominal pain was of borderline significance (SMD=0.29, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.59, I2=78%). Herbal therapy (RR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.88, I2=77%), dietary supplements (RR=1.95, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.73, I2=75%), and mind-body based therapy (RR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.49, I2=63%) showed benefit for overall response compared to placebo (low confidence in estimates). Body-based and energy healing therapies demonstrated no significant benefit over placebo or sham for abdominal pain or overall response.
CONCLUSIONS: CAM therapies such as herbal or dietary supplements and mind-body based approaches may be beneficial for abdominal pain and overall response in IBS. However, overall quality of evidence is low.

39207253,"Cyberbullying and Suicidal Behavior, Self-Harm, and Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies.","Aim: Identify and systematically review cohort studies examining the association between cyberbullying (CB) and suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, self-harm, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Methods: Systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Searches for relevant literature were conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, PsyINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane up until July 2023. Cohort studies were included that provided information regarding the association between CB and different dimensions pertaining to self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB) separately. Gathered information included data on study characteristics, sample characteristics, prevalence, and associations between CB and variables pertaining to SITB. Findings were synthesized, and grouping studies as a function of the outcome variable was analyzed. Results: A total of 19 studies were included. Suicidal ideation was analyzed in 11 studies, with the majority (n = 8) reporting statistically significant positive associations (aOR = 1.88 [1.08, 3.29], β = 0.08 to 0.47). Only a single study conducted independent analysis of attempted suicide, finding a statistically significant association (aOR 1.88 [1.08, 3.29]). Outcomes regarding the self-harm variable were equivocal, with only two out of five studies finding a statistically significant association and one of these, which conducted a gender differentiated analysis, only finding a significant association in females. Studies that considered the NSSI dimension were also inconclusive, with only a limited number of studies (n = 5) producing contradictory outcomes. Conclusion: There is a need to continue exploring the relationship between CB and different dimensions within the spectrum of SITB through longitudinal studies. It is recommended that analyses adopt a new perspective in which short-term follow-up is prioritized or individualized follow-up periods are considered, given the rapidly changing nature of suicidal tendencies.

35227598,The Role of Indication-Based Pricing in Future Pricing and Reimbursement Policies: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVES: Indication-based pricing (IBP) has received growing attention because of the expected increase in the number of new medicines with multiple indications. In our systematic review, we assess the potential benefits, barriers, current experiences, and future perspectives of different IBP mechanisms.
METHODS: We searched publications in English, Spanish, or French assessing the impact, international experience, and future context of IBP systems on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, EconLit, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment from 2000 to 2020. This was complemented by a gray literature search in Google Scholar.
RESULTS: A total of 29 publications that specifically addressed the topic of IBP were retained. The most commonly reported benefits of IBP were a better alignment of medicines' value and price, optimization of research and development incentives and increase of competition, and improvement of patients' access to treatments. Data collection and proper infrastructures, and the risk of high administrative burden and associated costs, were seen as the main barriers for proper IBP implementation. International experience lacks concrete examples of IBP. A single weighted average price according to volume, value, or a combination of both, appears to be the most used methodology, followed by different confidential net prices per indication. Different brands with distinct price per indication are less common, although it is considered a pure IBP system.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of IBP impact is still scarce, and there is a need for pilot projects and experiences to monitor its real consequences. An appropriate price and reimbursement model for multi-indication medicines should be a priority, but political will and proper data collection systems remain crucial.",Preckler V; Espín J,2022,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,25,4,666-675,10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.1376,"Preckler, V., & Espín, J.

35121775,"A systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of non-malignant, organic gastrointestinal disorders misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.","Treatable gastrointestinal disorders in patients with symptoms typical for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be overlooked. The prevalence of five gastrointestinal conditions-bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), carbohydrate malabsorption (CM), microscopic colitis (MC), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) was systematically assessed from studies including consecutive patients meeting diagnostic criteria for IBS. 4 databases were searched from 1978 to 2020. Studies were included if they evaluated the prevalence of these conditions in secondary healthcare setting. Estimated pooled rates were calculated and statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using Q and I2 statistics. Seven studies (n = 597) estimated the pooled prevalence for BAD as 41% (95% CI 29-54). 17 studies (n = 5068) estimated that of MC as 3% (95% CI 2-4%). Two studies (n = 478) suggested a rate of 4.6% (range: 1.8-6.1%) for PEI. Using breath testing, 26 studies (n = 6700) and 13 studies (n = 3415) estimated the prevalence of lactose and fructose malabsorption as 54% (95% CI 44-64%) and 43% (95% CI 23-62%); 36 studies (n = 4630) and 22 studies (n = 2149) estimated that of SIBO as 49% (95% CI 40-57%) with lactulose and 19% (95% CI 13-27%) with glucose. Rates of all conditions were significantly higher than in healthy controls. A significant proportion of patients presenting to secondary care with IBS have an organic condition which may account for their symptoms.

38258770,Systematic Review on Herbal Preparations for Controlling Visceral Hypersensitivity in Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is an overreaction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to various stimuli and is characterized by hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. VH contributes to the etiology of many GI dysfunctions, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the exact mechanisms underlying VH are yet to be found, inflammation and oxidative stress, psychosocial factors, and sensorimotor alterations may play significant roles in it.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we provide an overview of VH and its pathophysiological function in GI disorders. Adverse effects of synthetic drugs may make herbal agents a good candidate for pain management. Therefore, in this review, we will discuss the efficacy of herbal agents in the management of VH with a focus on their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials.
METHODS: Data were extracted from clinical and animal studies published in English between 2004 and June, 2020, which were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.
RESULTS: Overall, Radix, Melissia, Glycyrrhizae, Mentha, and Liquorice were the most efficient herbals for VH management in IBS and dyspepsia, predominantly through modulation of the mRNA expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) and suppression of 5- hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) or the serotonin receptors.
CONCLUSION: Considering the positive effects of herbal formulations in VH management, further research on novel herbal and/or herbal/chemical preparations is warranted.",Lashgari NA; Roudsari NM; Momtaz S; Niazi Shahraki F; Zandi N; Pazoki B; Farzaei MH; Ghasemi M; Abdollahi M; Abdolghaffari AH,2024,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,25,13,1632-1650,10.2174/0113892010261502231102040149,"Lashgari, N.

39235428,The effects of vitamin D intake and status on symptom severity and quality-of-life in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Many individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have insufficient or deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status; however, it is not clear if improved vitamin D nutritional status through higher intake can improve symptom severity and quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify if changes in vitamin D intake or status affect symptom severity and quality of life in adults with IBS.Data Sources: MEDLINE®, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Global Health, EMBASE, and Web-of-Science databases were systematically searched for relevant articles to August 12, 2024, in the English language.Study Selection: Clinical trials, prospective observational studies, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses reporting the effect of vitamin D intake or status on IBS-related outcomes were included.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Article review and data extraction were conducted by 2 authors following the PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses and the Nutrition Quality Evaluation Strengthening Tools to assess risk of bias were employed for randomized controlled trials.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary outcomes included measures of serum 25(OH)D status, symptom severity, and quality of life.
RESULTS: 12 studies from 15 articles were included (n = 7 RCTs; n = 3 single-arm interventions; n = 2 MR). Seven study populations had deficient (<20 ng/mL) and three had insufficient (21-29 ng/mL) baseline serum 25(OH)D status. RCTs measured changes in serum 25(OH)D after 6-26 wks with 3,000 IU daily to 50,000 IU bi-weekly vitamin D dosages. Meta-analyses of low risk-of-bias RCTs revealed increased 25(OH)D levels in groups treated with oral vitamin D compared to placebo (n = 5; Pooled mean difference [95% CI]: 20.33 [12.91, 27.74] ng/mL; I2 = 97.9%). Quality of life scores improved significantly in deficient populations (n = 3; 3.19 [2.14, 4.24]; I2 = 0.0%). Non-significant decreased trends in IBS symptom severity were shown across populations (n = 6: -25.89 [-55.26, 3.48]; I2 = 92.8%).

35813370,Transcriptional and Epigenetic Response to Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: The links of sedentary behavior and physical activity with health outcomes in children and adolescents is well known. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We aimed to synthesize the current knowledge of the association of sedentary behavior and physical activity (acute and chronic effects) with gene expression and epigenetic modifications in children and adolescents.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically searched until April 2022. A total of 15 articles were eligible for this review. The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews and/or a modified version of the Downs and Black checklist.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies used candidate gene approach, while only 2 studies performed high-throughput analyses. The candidate genes significantly linked to sedentary behavior or physical activity were: FOXP3, HSD11B2, IL-10, TNF-α, ADRB2, VEGF, HSP70, SOX, and GPX. Non-coding Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) regulated by sedentary behavior or physical activity were: miRNA-222, miRNA-146a, miRNA-16, miRNA-126, miR-320a, and long non-coding RNA MALAT1. These molecules are involved in inflammation, immune function, angiogenic process, and cardiovascular disease. Transcriptomics analyses detected thousands of genes that were altered following an acute bout of physical activity and are linked to gene pathways related to immune function, apoptosis, and metabolic diseases.
CONCLUSION: The evidence found to date is rather limited. Multidisciplinary studies are essential to characterize the molecular mechanisms in response to sedentary behavior and physical activity in the pediatric population. Larger cohorts and randomized controlled trials, in combination with multi-omics analyses, may provide the necessary data to bring the field forward.

39289768,"Clinical efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
METHODS: We searched four databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared FMT with a control intervention in patients with IBS. The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool was chosen for appraisal. Meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted. Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence (CoE).
RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs with a total of 615 participants. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference between the FMT and control groups in terms of clinical responses (relative risk [RR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-2.33) and changes in IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) scores (standardised mean difference [SMD] = - 0.31, 95% CI - 0.72 to 0.09) and IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) scores (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI - 0.09 to 0.69). Subgroup analysis revealed that in studies with low RoB and using endoscopy, nasojejunal tube and rectal enema delivery, FMT led to a significant improvement in clinical responses and changes in IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL scores. TSA suggested that the current evidence is inconclusive and that the CoE is very low.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that patients with IBS may benefit from FMT especially when it is administered via endoscopy, nasojejunal tube or rectal enema. However, the certainty of evidence is very low. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of FMT for IBS treatment.

36871131,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Is Not Associated with an Increased Risk of Polyps and Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in the US. Several factors are associated with increased/decreased CRC risk and often linked to adenomatous colorectal polyps (CRP). Recent studies suggest a lower risk of neoplastic lesions among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. We aimed to systematically assess the occurrence of CRC and CRP in IBS patients.
METHODS: Searches of the Medline, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were performed, blindly and independently, by two investigators. Studies of CRC or CRP incidence in IBS patients (diagnosed by Rome or other symptom-based criteria) were eligible for inclusion. CRC and CRP effect estimates were pooled in meta-analyses using random models.
RESULTS: Of 4941 non-duplicate studies, 14 were included, comprising 654,764 IBS patients and 2,277,195 controls in 8 cohort studies, and 26,641 IBS patients and 87,803 controls in 6 cross-sectional studies. Pooled analysis revealed a significantly decreased prevalence of CRP in IBS subjects vs. controls, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.29 (95% CI (0.15, 0.54)). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 96%, p < 0.01). This finding persisted when studies which did not report pre-cancerous polyps separately were excluded (OR 0.23, 95% CI (0.15, 0.35), I2 = 85%, p < 0.01). CRC prevalence was lower in IBS subjects, but this did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.40, 95% CI (0.09, 1.77]).
CONCLUSION: Our analyses reveal a decreased incidence of colorectal polyps in IBS, although CRC did not reach significance. Mechanistic studies with detailed genotypic analysis and clinical phenotyping are needed to better elucidate the potentially protective effect of IBS on CRC development.",Vichos T; Rezaie A; Vichos P; Cash B; Pimentel M,2023,Digestive diseases and sciences,68,6,2585-2596,10.1007/s10620-023-07885-6,"Vichos, T., Rezaie, A., Vichos, P., Cash, B., & Pimentel, M.

39450928,The role of neutrophils in pain: systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies.,"The peripheral inflammatory response is an attractive therapeutic target for pain treatment. Neutrophils are the first circulating inflammatory cells recruited to sites of injury, but their contribution to pain outcomes is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of original preclinical studies, which evaluated the effect of preemptive neutrophil depletion on pain outcomes (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022364004). Literature search (PubMed, January 19, 2023) identified 49 articles, which were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was evaluated using SYRCLE's tool. The pooled effect considering all studies showed that neutrophil depletion induced a consistent pain reduction. Inflammatory, joint, neuropathic, and visceral pain showed significant pain alleviation by neutrophil depletion with medium-large effect sizes. However, muscle and postoperative pain were not significantly alleviated by neutrophil depletion. Further analysis showed a differential contribution of neutrophils to pain outcomes. Neutrophils had a higher impact on mechanical hyperalgesia, followed by nociceptive behaviors and mechanical allodynia, with a smaller contribution to thermal hyperalgesia. Interspecies (mice or rats) differences were not appreciated. Analyses regarding intervention unveiled a lower pain reduction for some commonly used methods for neutrophil depletion, such as injection of antineutrophil serum or an anti-Gr-1 antibody, than for other agents such as administration of an anti-Ly6G antibody, fucoidan, vinblastine, CXCR1/2 inhibitors, and etanercept. In conclusion, the contribution of neutrophils to pain depends on pain etiology (experimental model), pain outcome, and the neutrophil depletion strategy. Further research is needed to improve our understanding on the mechanisms of these differences.",Huerta MÁ; Molina-Álvarez M; García MM; Tejada MA; Goicoechea C; Ghasemlou N; Ruiz-Cantero MC; Cobos EJ,2025,Pain,166,6,1230-1249,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003450,"Huerta, M.

Data on risk and protective influences have yielded conflicting evidence on the effects of alternative interventions, such as vitamin D. This review focuses on the effects of vitamin D on IBS. A systematic review and meta-analysis considered all articles published until 4 April 2022. The search for randomized controlled trials assessing vitamin D efficacy in IBS with outcomes, primary (Irritable Bowel Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)) and secondary (IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL) and serum level of calcifediol (25(OH)D)), was performed on six databases, Google Scholar, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, PubMed (MEDLINE), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included six trials with 616 patients. The pooled analysis found no difference between vitamin D and placebo in improving IBS-SSS (MD: -45.82 with 95% CI [-93.62, 1.98], p = 0.06). However, the pooled analysis favored vitamin D over placebo in improving the IBS-Qol (MD: 6.19 with 95% CI [0.35, 12.03], p = 0.04) and serum 25(OH)D (MD: 25.2 with 95% CI [18.41, 31.98], p = 0.00001).

33559026,Effects of gastrointestinal delivery of non-caloric tastants on energy intake: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Taste receptors are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The activation of post-oral taste receptors using tastants could provide a non-invasive treatment option in combating the obesity epidemic. The aim of this review was to examine the effect of post-oral delivery of non-caloric tastants on eating behavior reflected by primary outcome energy intake and secondary outcomes GI symptoms and perceptions and potential underlying mechanisms. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of the Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases was performed. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the PROSPERO database on 26 February 2020 (ID: CRD42020171182). Two researchers independently screened 11,912 articles and extracted information from 19 articles. If at least two studies investigated the effect of the same taste compound on primary outcome energy intake, a meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled effect sizes.
RESULTS: Nineteen papers including healthy volunteers were included. In the 19 papers analyzed, effects of various tastants were investigated in healthy volunteers. Most extensively investigated were bitter tastants. The meta-analysis of effects of bitter tastants showed a significant reduction in energy intake of 54.62 kcal (95% CI - 78.54 to - 30.69, p = 0.0014).
CONCLUSIONS: Bitter stimuli are most potent to influence eating behavior. Energy intake decreased after post-oral delivery of bitter tastants.

37515755,Sleep Problems in Pediatric Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs) are common, and findings are mixed on rates of sleep problems (e.g., sleep quality) in pediatric populations. A clear understanding of sleep problems in pediatric DGBIs is needed as sleep challenges might negatively impact symptoms and prognoses. The aims of this systematic review are to (1) describe the prevalence and types of sleep problems in pediatric patients with DGBIs and examine differences by DGBI diagnosis and (2) examine the relationship among sleep problems and pain, mood, and functional outcomes in pediatric patients with DGBIs.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Medline in June 2022; articles were included if they enrolled ≤19 years old with a DGBI, used a quantitative assessment of sleep problems, and were available in English. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to assess study quality. We used a protocol to systematically pull and tabulate data across articles with quality assessment ratings.
RESULTS: Twenty-four articles with 110,864 participants across 9 countries were included, with most studies being of moderate to weak quality. Patients with DGBIs reported more sleep problems than healthy peers, and some research reviewed found that patients with IBS had more sleep problems than other DGBI diagnoses. Sleep problems in DGBIs were related to worse mood, pain, and functional outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with DGBIs are experiencing sleep problems that can impact outcomes. Screening for sleep problems and targeted treatment is needed to best support these patients.",Robbertz AS; Shneider C; Cohen LL; Reed B,2023,Journal of pediatric psychology,48,9,778-786,10.1093/jpepsy/jsad047,"Robbertz, A.

40035292,The effects of low FODMAP diet on gut microbiota regulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet on gut microbiota regulation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Data databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low FODMAP diets with normal diets were included. The primary outcome was the effect on intestinal flora. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. Ten RCTs involving 590 participants were included in the analysis. The low FODMAP diet showed a significant positive effect on intestinal flora compared to normal diets (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI [0.01, 0.64], p = 0.003). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 67.5%). Subgroup analysis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients revealed no significant difference between low FODMAP and normal diets (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.32], p = 0.306), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 17.0%). No significant publication bias was detected (Egger's test, p = 0.328). This meta-analysis suggests that a low FODMAP diet may have a positive effect on gut microbiota regulation. However, the effect appears to be less pronounced in IBS patients. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the long-term impact of low FODMAP diets on gut health across various gastrointestinal disorders.",Chu P; He Y; Hu F; Wang X,2025,Journal of food science,90,3,e70072,10.1111/1750-3841.70072,"Chu, P., He, Y., Hu, F., & Wang, X.

39028059,Diagnostic potential of various laboratory tests for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify possible tests along with their accuracies that may be used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome.
METHODS: The systematic review comprised literature search on Cochrane Library, PubMed, Science Direct and Elsevier databases for randomised controlled trials and cohort studies conducted from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022, using appropriate key words and Boolean operators. Focus was kept on studies that reported irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis as the primary outcome. The risk of bias was assessed using quality assessment, data abstraction, and synthesis version 2.
RESULTS: Of the 2,798 studies initially identified, 10(0.35%) were analysed in detail. Of them, 4(40%) used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to test for anti-cytolethal distending toxin B and anti-vinculin levels, 2(20%) used the kits for serum cytokine profiling and serum calprotectin levels, and 4(40%) used either magnetic resonance imaging scans, faecal metabolic profiling, intestinal biopsy analysis with immunostaining or polymerase chain reaction for differential transferribonucleic acid-derived small ribonucleic acid. Out of the 4(40%) studies on anti-cytolethal distending toxin B and anti-vinculin levels, optical densities >1.56 and >1.60 recorded 100% specificity for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea, but sensitivity was 22%. In contrast, rectal biopsies for cell densities of somatostatin and peptide YY showed high sensitivity and specificity for irritable bowel syndrome ranging 80-90%.

33407171,Alterations in short-chain fatty acids and serotonin in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) may be associated with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are some reports of alterations in SCFAs and 5-HT in IBS, but their results are inconsistent. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to assess alterations in SCFAs and 5-HT in IBS patients and their potential role in the abnormal brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) axis.
METHODS: Case-control studies detecting SCFAs and 5-HT in IBS patients were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases to identify relevant articles up to September 2018. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SCFAs and 5-HT were calculated by REVIEW MANAGER 5.3 to evaluate the alterations of 5-HT and SCFAs in IBS.
RESULTS: Five studies on SCFAs and 5 on 5-HT in IBS patients were included. As compared to healthy controls (HCs), the SMDs of 5-HT in IBS patients was 2.35 (95% CI 0.46-4.24) and the SMDs of total SCFAs, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in IBS patients were - 0.01 (95% CI - 0.57-0.55), - 0.04 (95% CI - 0.55-0.47), 0.07 (95% CI - 0.45-0.60), and - 0.00 (95% CI - 0.49-0.49), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in 5-HT in blood of IBS patients, indicating the increased 5-HT in blood may be involved in IBS pathogenesis. However, there were no significant differences in SCFAs in feces between IBS patients and HCs. But the study did not differentiate between subgroups of IBS. These findings might provide insight for future studies of the BGM axis in the pathogenesis of IBS.

31876406,Association of Intestinal Disorders with Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with an overall global incidence of 40 million. Many studies have revealed the association of intestinal disorders and bacterial infections with PD, but few studies have found such a relationship with AD. In this meta-analysis, related articles published up to September 2018 were searched in PubMed. Of the 2121 related articles screened initially, 56 were found to be eligible. Data on the risks of PD and AD due to five intestinal disorders and infection with Helicobacter pylori, as a representative intestinal microbe, were obtained, and a fixed- or random-effects model was used to pool the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) from individual studies. The combined OR for all types of intestinal disorders with an increased risk of PD was 3.36 (95% CI: 2.70-4.17). The ORs for each category were as follows: constipation, 4.05 (95% CI, 3.24-5.06); inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89-1.52); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.55-5.56); small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, 5.15 (95% CI, 3.33-7.96); and diarrhea, 1.27 (95% CI, 0.28-5.75). The combined OR of all types of intestinal disorders with an increased risk of AD was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09-2.13). The ORs for IBS and IBD were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.02-1.99) and 2.40 (95% CI, 1.00-5.76), respectively. The risk estimates of H. pylori infection in PD and AD patients were as follows: OR, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.43-1.91) and OR, 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12-1.76), respectively. These findings suggest that PD and AD are significantly associated with intestinal disorders. The negative roles of H. pylori in the development of PD or AD should be evaluated to shed new light on the diagnosis and treatment of PD and AD. National governments should periodically inspect the intestinal condition of residents and extend health plans to improve intestinal health to prevent potential neurological disorders.",Fu P; Gao M; Yung KKL,2020,ACS chemical neuroscience,11,3,395-405,10.1021/acschemneuro.9b00607,"Fu, P., Gao, M., & Yung, K.

33331483,Systematic review with meta-analysis: lubiprostone efficacy on the treatment of patients with constipation.,"BACKGROUND: Lubiprostone is a type 2 chloride channel activator that has been shown to be efficacious and safe in the treatment for chronic constipation.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of lubiprostone for patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation (IBS-C) and opioid-induced constipation (OIC).
METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane Collaboration Database, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Lubiprostone RCTs reporting outcomes of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) and abdominal pain or discomfort were deemed eligible. Meta-analysis was performed calculating risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals, using the Mantel-Haenszel method and random effects model.
RESULTS: Searches yielded 109 records representing 93 non-duplicate publications, and 11 RCTs (978 CIC, 1,366 IBS-C, 1,300 OIC, total = 3,644) met inclusion criteria. Qualitative synthesis showed that for CIC patients, lubiprostone is superior to placebo in terms of SBM outcomes. Meta-analysis for CIC was feasible for full responder and SBM within 24h rates, indicating superiority of lubiprostone over placebo. For IBS-C, lubiprostone was significantly superior for all SBM outcomes in follow-ups ranging from 1 week-3 months. In terms of abdominal pain, lubiprostone provided significantly better symptoms relief, particularly after 1 month of treatment. For OIC, lubiprostone was more effective than placebo for both SBM and discomfort measures.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that lubiprostone is superior to placebo in terms of SBM frequency for CIC, IBS-C and OIC. In terms of abdominal symptoms, the most pronounced effect was seen for abdominal pain in IBS-C patients.",Passos MDCF; Takemoto MLS; Corradino GC; Guedes LS,2020,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,57,4,498-506,10.1590/S0004-2803.202000000-83,"Passos, M.

32610476,Probiotic Strains and Intervention Total Doses for Modulating Obesity-Related Microbiota Dysbiosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Obesity is a growing health threat worldwide. Administration of probiotics in obesity has also parallelly increased but without any protocolization. We conducted a systematic review exploring the administration pattern of probiotic strains and effective doses for obesity-related disorders according to their capacity of positively modulating key biomarkers and microbiota dysbiosis. Manuscripts targeting probiotic strains and doses administered for obesity-related disorders in clinical studies were sought. MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using keywords during the last fifteen years up to April 2020. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and then full-text papers against inclusion criteria according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. From 549 interventional reports identified, we filtered 171 eligible studies, from which 24 full-text assays were used for calculating intervention total doses (ITD) of specific species and strains administered. Nine of these reports were excluded in the second-step because no specific data on gut microbiota modulation was found. Six clinical trials (CT) and 9 animal clinical studies were retained for analysis of complete outcome prioritized (body mass index (BMI), adiposity parameters, glucose, and plasma lipid biomarkers, and gut hormones). Lactobacillus spp. administered were double compared to Bifidobacterium spp.; Lactobacillus as single or multispecies formulations whereas most Bifidobacteria only through multispecies supplementations. Differential factors were estimated from obese populations' vs. obesity-induced animals: ITD ratio of 2 × 106 CFU and patterns of administrations of 11.3 weeks to 5.5 weeks, respectively. Estimation of overall probiotics impact from selected CT was performed through a random-effects model to pool effect sizes. Comparisons showed a positive association between the probiotics group vs. placebo on the reduction of BMI, total cholesterol, leptin, and adiponectin. Moreover, negative estimation appeared for glucose (FPG) and CRP. While clinical trials including data for positive modulatory microbiota capacities suggested that high doses of common single and multispecies of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium ameliorated key obesity-related parameters, the major limitation was the high variability between studies and lack of standardized protocols. Efforts in solving this problem and searching for next-generation probiotics for obesity-related diseases would highly improve the rational use of probiotics.",López-Moreno A; Suárez A; Avanzi C; Monteoliva-Sánchez M; Aguilera M,2020,Nutrients,12,7,,10.3390/nu12071921,"López-Moreno, A., Suárez, A., Avanzi, C., Monteoliva-Sánchez, M., & Aguilera, M.

37479785,White matter alterations in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): a systematic review of 129 diffusion imaging studies with meta-analysis.,"Aberrant anatomical brain connections in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are reported inconsistently across diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) studies. Based on a pre-registered protocol (Prospero: CRD42021259192), we searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Knowledge until 26/03/2022 to conduct a systematic review of DWI studies. We performed a quality assessment based on imaging acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis. Using signed differential mapping, we meta-analyzed a subset of the retrieved studies amenable to quantitative evidence synthesis, i.e., tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies, in individuals of any age and, separately, in children, adults, and high-quality datasets. Finally, we conducted meta-regressions to test the effect of age, sex, and medication-naïvety. We included 129 studies (6739 ADHD participants and 6476 controls), of which 25 TBSS studies provided peak coordinates for case-control differences in fractional anisotropy (FA)(32 datasets) and 18 in mean diffusivity (MD)(23 datasets). The systematic review highlighted white matter alterations (especially reduced FA) in projection, commissural and association pathways of individuals with ADHD, which were associated with symptom severity and cognitive deficits. The meta-analysis showed a consistent reduced FA in the splenium and body of the corpus callosum, extending to the cingulum. Lower FA was related to older age, and case-control differences did not survive in the pediatric meta-analysis. About 68% of studies were of low quality, mainly due to acquisitions with non-isotropic voxels or lack of motion correction; and the sensitivity analysis in high-quality datasets yielded no significant results. Findings suggest prominent alterations in posterior interhemispheric connections subserving cognitive and motor functions affected in ADHD, although these might be influenced by non-optimal acquisition parameters/preprocessing. Absence of findings in children may be related to the late development of callosal fibers, which may enhance case-control differences in adulthood. Clinicodemographic and methodological differences were major barriers to consistency and comparability among studies, and should be addressed in future investigations.",Parlatini V; Itahashi T; Lee Y; Liu S; Nguyen TT; Aoki YY; Forkel SJ; Catani M; Rubia K; Zhou JH; Murphy DG; Cortese S,2023,Molecular psychiatry,28,10,4098-4123,10.1038/s41380-023-02173-1,"Parlatini, V., Itahashi, T., Lee, Y., Liu, S., Nguyen, T.

39560589,Efficacy of acupuncture treatment for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome with comorbid anxiety and depression: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Presently, a diverse range of Western medical interventions are accessible for the management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) concomitant with comorbid anxiety and depression. However, the concomitant adverse effects have also surfaced, exerting strain on healthcare resources and the socio-economic structure. In recent times, the benefits of acupuncture in the management of IBS-D with coexisting anxiety and depression have become progressively evident. Nevertheless, a paucity of evidence-based medicine exists to substantiate the utilization of acupuncture for the treatment of IBS-D with anxiety and depression. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture as an intervention for IBS-D with comorbid anxiety and depression.
METHODS: We searched 7 databases, including the Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Academic Journals Full-text Database, VIP Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to acupuncture treatment for IBS with anxiety and depression, published from database inception to August 1, 2023. RevMan 5.4 and Stata 17.0 software were used for meta-analysis of relevant outcome measures.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 16 RCTs, involving 1305 IBS-D patients (691 in the experimental group and 614 in the control group). The meta-analysis results showed that compared to oral medication, acupuncture therapy improved HAMD scores (MD = 0.88, 95% CI = [0.68, 1.07], P < .00001), HAMA scores (MD = 2.32, 95% CI = [1.70, 2.93], P < .00001), self-rating anxiety scale scores (MD = 11.67, 95% CI = [10.85, 12.49], P < .00001), SDS scores (MD = 9.84, 95% CI = [8.52, 11.16], P < .00001), IBS-SSS scores (MD = 37.48, 95% CI = [12.17, 62.78], P = .004), overall response rate (MD = 1.27, 95% CI = [1.20, 1.35], P < .00001), and relapse rate (MD = 0.27, 95% CI = [0.16, 0.47], P < .00001) in patients with IBS-D comorbid with anxiety and depression.
