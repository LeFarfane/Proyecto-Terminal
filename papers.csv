40890424,Bioinformatic analyses and validated experiments reveal an aging hallmark gene set and protective miR of coronary artery disease.,"To investigate how aging hallmarks exert roles in the age-related disease of coronary artery disease (CAD). R software and the GEO2R online tool identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMis) in CAD microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Genes common to target genes of DEMis, DEGs, and an aging gene list from Human Aging Genomic Resources were then identified and analyzed for protein-protein interactions and functional and pathway enrichment. An miR-mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the diagnostic utility of DEMis in CAD. The expression of two DEMis from a CAD cohort was employed to validate the findings. An aging hallmark gene set, comprising 18 genes, was delineated, with the hub gene TP53 established through protein-protein interaction and microRNA-mRNA networks. Within the microRNA-mRNA network, two DEMis (hsa-miR-423-5p and hsa-miR-564) potentially regulated TP53, rendering them potential CAD biomarkers, as indicated by their area under the curves (AUC) surpassing 0.6. Validation experiments corroborated an AUC of 0.7002 for hsa-miR-423-5p and 0.7261 for hsa-miR-564, highlighting its protective association with CAD. Combining hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-564, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), white blood cells (WBC) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.783. A CAD-associated gene set was identified, with TP53 as the central hub. Hsa-miR-564 emerged as a potential protective factor against CAD.",Chen J; Huang HZ; Wu HY; Wang GD; Deng JL; Wu DF; Wen LN; Qiu LL; Cui CX; Song CY; Pan SL,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,32102,10.1038/s41598-025-17668-w,"Chen, J., Huang, H.

40890196,Umbilical cord-derived exosomes alleviate spinal cord injury by regulating microglial polarization through miR-340-5p-mediated modulation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a condition of the central nervous system, results in impairments in both sensory and motor functions. Presently, there exists a deficiency in efficacious therapies. Nonetheless, employing exosomes, a derivative of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs), is proven to be a successful approach in treating SCI, yet the exact way they function is still not well understood. Our research involved conducting a laminectomy on mice's thoracic T8-T10 and subsequently striking the revealed spinal cord using an altered Allen's weight descending apparatus (8 g, height 50 mm, 8 g × 50 mm) to create a model for SCI animals. To create a model of BV2 inflammation, BV2 cells underwent a 24-hour treatment with 1 μg/mL LPS. The expression of related genes and proteins was identified using RT‒qPCR and western blot. ELISA, immunofluorescence staining, and HE staining were employed to assess the polarization of BV2 cells and spinal cord tissue damage in mice. The research indicated that exosomes originating from hucMSCs are capable of markedly hindering the M1 polarization in BV2 cells, diminishing inflammation, and lessening the progression of SCI in vivo. From a mechanistic standpoint, exosomes originating from hucMSCs suppressed iNOS and CD16 levels, enhanced Arg1 and CD206 expression, lessened BV2 cells' M1 polarization, and concurrently suppressed LPS-triggered inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, ultimately easing LPS-triggered inflammation and mitigating SCI progression. The impact of exosomes derived from hucMSCs primarily resulted from the enhancement of miR-340-5p expression, which in turn suppressed the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. The findings of our research indicate that exosomes derived from hucMSCs could represent an innovative approach in treating SCI.",Pan Z; Zhang Y; Yan N; Tao R; Yu J; Zhang S; Tang K; Yang W; Ding W; Lv S,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,32226,10.1038/s41598-025-16621-1,"Pan, Z., Zhang, Y., Yan, N., Tao, R., Yu, J., Zhang, S., Tang, K., Yang, W., Ding, W., & Lv, S.

40890107,Overexpression miR-125a-5p inhibits HSCs activation and alleviates liver fibrosis through TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway and autophagy.,"Liver fibrosis represents an important pathological stage during chronic hepatopathy development, posing a significant threat to human health. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), an essential hepatic non-parenchymal cells, have a key effect on fibrogenesis, with their activation being a hallmark of liver fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the small non-coding RNAs, become the critical biomarkers and regulatory molecules in fibrotic processes. Among them, miR-125a-5p is implicated in cancer and inflammatory pathways, yet its functional role and mechanistic involvement in HSC activation remain poorly understood. According to our findings, miR-125a-5p expression was significantly decreased in TGF-β-activated HSC-T6 cells. Notably, ectopic miR-125a-5p overexpression effectively inhibited TGF-β-mediated HSC-T6 activation. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-125a-5p attenuated HSC activation while ameliorating liver fibrosis through regulating the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and autophagy. Additionally, TGFβR1 was miR-125a-5p's target gene. Collectively, miR-125a-5p negatively regulates HSC activation in liver fibrosis, exerting its anti-fibrotic activities through suppressing the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and autophagy modulation.",Zhang C; Zhao Y; Yan H; Guo J; Yu G,2025,Cell death discovery,11,1,419,10.1038/s41420-025-02694-4,"Zhang, C., Zhao, Y., Yan, H., Guo, J., & Yu, G.

40889454,Integrated electrochemical biosensor featuring nanoforest hierarchical architectures and catalytic hairpin amplification for breast cancer diagnosis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serves as a crucial biomarker for early cancer diagnosis, and dual-target miRNA detection significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. However, the uncontrollable uniformity of multi-capture probe modifications, limited electrode sites, and high sample consumption restrict the advancement of electrochemical biosensors in clinical diagnostics. In this work, an integrated microdroplet chip electrochemical biosensor has been ingeniously developed, including TiO2 nanorods modified by Au nanoparticles vertically arranged on the FTO as the working electrode, which exhibits high electron transfer efficiency and abundant anchoring sites for capture probes; A Y-shaped probe was designed with one end immobilized via Au-S covalent bonding while the two free arms enabled simultaneous dual-target miRNA recognition; By employing Au/TiO2-FTO as both the substrate for a custom micro-detection chamber and the working electrode, coupled with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), the sensor achieves ultrahigh-precision trace-level detection of dual miRNAs. As a result, the proposed biosensor demonstrated robust performance for breast cancer biomarkers miRNA-21 and miRNA-155 in a linear detection range of 10 fM-100 nM with detection limits of 5.00 fM and 5.17 fM respectively. Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) as high as 0.98 for both miRNA21 and miRNA155 indicates excellent diagnostic accuracy, validated through 40 clinical samples, and is highly consistent with magnetic resonance imaging and pathology findings. Notably, by altering the recognition sequence at the two free arms of the Y-shaped probe, this biosensor can be readily adapted for diagnosing other diseases, highlighting its promising remarkable versatility and applicability.",Chen Wen XY; Liu D; Cheng C; Fang WK; Lei YM; Ye HR; Zeng SE; Li CY,2025,Talanta,297,Pt B,128766,10.1016/j.talanta.2025.128766,"Chen Wen, X.

34013858,Reflections on 40 Years of AIDS.,"June 2021 marks the 40th anniversary of the first description of AIDS. On the 30th anniversary, we defined priorities as improving use of existing interventions, clarifying optimal use of HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy for prevention and treatment, continuing research, and ensuring sustainability of the response. Despite scientific and programmatic progress, the end of AIDS is not in sight. Other major epidemics over the past decade have included Ebola, arbovirus infections, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A benchmark against which to compare other global interventions is the HIV/AIDS response in terms of funding, coordination, and solidarity. Lessons from Ebola and HIV/AIDS are pertinent to the COVID-19 response. The fifth decade of AIDS will have to position HIV/AIDS in the context of enhanced preparedness and capacity to respond to other potential pandemics and transnational health threats.",De Cock KM; Jaffe HW; Curran JW,2021,Emerging infectious diseases,27,6,1553-1560,10.3201/eid2706.210284,"De Cock, K.

33064990,Timeline: HIV.,"The human immunodeficiency virus, the lentivirus that causes AIDS, is responsible for the most prevalent epidemic in the history of mankind. Here in this Timeline, we have attempted to illustrate a short history of HIV-1, from its identification in landmark papers published by Robert Gallo, Myron Essex, and Luc Montagnier, to the numerous drug and vaccine trials as well as the stride toward a possible cure. Even today, a vaccine and cure against HIV-1 remains elusive. In spite of this, in the space of 30 years, from the time when being HIV positive meant an instant death sentence, to today where millions of HIV positive people are living normal lives, the progress we have made in such a short period of time should be celebrated.

36675077,A CRISPR-Cas Cure for HIV/AIDS.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and HIV-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continue to represent a global health burden. There is currently no effective vaccine, nor any cure, for HIV infections; existing antiretroviral therapy can suppress viral replication, but only as long as antiviral drugs are taken. HIV infects cells of the host immune system, and it can establish a long-lived viral reservoir, which can be targeted and edited through gene therapy. Gene editing platforms based on the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat-Cas system (CRISPR-Cas) have been recognized as promising tools in the development of gene therapies for HIV infections. In this review, we evaluate the current landscape of CRISPR-Cas-based therapies against HIV, with an emphasis on the infection biology of the virus as well as the activity of host restriction factors. We discuss the potential of a combined CRISPR-Cas approach that targets host and viral genes to activate antiviral host factors and inhibit viral replication simultaneously. Lastly, we focus on the challenges and potential solutions of CRISPR-Cas gene editing approaches in achieving an HIV cure.",Hussein M; Molina MA; Berkhout B; Herrera-Carrillo E,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,24,2,,10.3390/ijms24021563,"Hussein, M., Molina, M.

31965635,Incomplete immune reconstitution in HIV/AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy: Challenges of immunological non-responders.,"The morbidity and mortality of HIV type-1 (HIV-1)-related diseases were dramatically diminished by the grounds of the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy, which induces persistent suppression of HIV-1 replication and gradual recovery of CD4+ T-cell counts. However, ∼10-40% of HIV-1-infected individuals fail to achieve normalization of CD4+ T-cell counts despite persistent virological suppression. These patients are referred to as ""inadequate immunological responders,"" ""immunodiscordant responders,"" or ""immunological non-responders (INRs)"" who show severe immunological dysfunction. Indeed, INRs are at an increased risk of clinical progression to AIDS and non-AIDS events and present higher rates of mortality than HIV-1-infected individuals with adequate immune reconstitution. To date, the underlying mechanism of incomplete immune reconstitution in HIV-1-infected patients has not been fully elucidated. In light of this limitation, it is of substantial practical significance to deeply understand the mechanism of immune reconstitution and design effective individualized treatment strategies. Therefore, in this review, we aim to highlight the mechanism and risk factors of incomplete immune reconstitution and strategies to intervene.",Yang X; Su B; Zhang X; Liu Y; Wu H; Zhang T,2020,Journal of leukocyte biology,107,4,597-612,10.1002/JLB.4MR1019-189R,"Yang, X., Su, B., Zhang, X., Liu, Y., Wu, H., & Zhang, T.

38201268,Advancements in Cell-Based Therapies for HIV Cure.,"The treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has evolved since the establishment of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the 1990s, providing HIV-infected individuals with approaches that suppress viral replication, prevent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) throughout their lifetime with continuous therapy, and halt HIV transmission. However, despite the success of these regimens, the global HIV epidemic persists, prompting a comprehensive exploration of potential strategies for an HIV cure. Here, we offer a consolidated overview of cell-based therapies for HIV-1, focusing on CAR-T cell approaches, gene editing, and immune modulation. Persistent challenges, including CAR-T cell susceptibility to HIV infection, stability, and viral reservoir control, underscore the need for continued research.

31939111,Optimizing Treatment for Adults with HIV/AIDS in China: Successes over Two Decades and Remaining Challenges.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The introduction of the National Free Antiretroviral Therapy Program (NFATP) in 2003 by the China National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention has led to dramatic increases in antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-infected Chinese patients. Despite limitations in the number of available free antiretroviral drugs, the overall mortality associated with HIV/AIDS has dropped from 39.3 per 100 person-years in 2002 to 3.1 in 2014. In this review, we summarize the challenges, responses, and achievements of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in China over the past 20 years.
RECENT FINDINGS: Continuous optimization of the Chinese National Guidelines for HIV/AIDS Diagnosis and Treatment has been guided by data from serial domestic multi-center studies aimed at evaluating efficacy and toxicity of available ART regimens among Chinese patients with HIV, with the goal of maximizing adherence, access, and efficacy. In addition, increasing attention has been focused on the importance of continuity in the HIV care cascade to promote linkage to care, and address the multidisciplinary chronic care needs HIV/AIDS patients on lifelong ART. Great progress has been achieved in the past 20 years in terms of access to and optimization of antiretroviral treatment in China. As the number of patients receiving long-term ART continues to grow, the focus of HIV/AIDS treatment has gradually transitioned from urgent care to the management of non-AIDS-related chronic complications and control of chronic inflammation.",Cao W; Hsieh E; Li T,2020,Current HIV/AIDS reports,17,1,26-34,10.1007/s11904-019-00478-x,"Cao, W., Hsieh, E., & Li, T.

34759226,Prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in China: lessons from the past three decades.,"In the past 37 years, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has undergone various major transmission routes in China, with the world most complex co-circulating HIV-1 subtypes, even the prevalence is still low. In response to the first epidemic outbreak of HIV in injecting drug users and the second one by illegal commercial blood collection, China issued the Anti-Drug Law and launched the Blood Donation Act and nationwide nucleic acid testing, which has avoided 98,232 to 211,200 estimated infections and almost ended the blood product-related infection. China has been providing free antiretroviral therapy (ART) since 2003, which covered >80% of the identified patients and achieved a viral suppression rate of 91%.

32359925,HIV/AIDS-knowledge and attitudes in the Arabian Peninsula: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS prevention has been widely adopted worldwide, but little is known about HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitudes in the Arabian Peninsula.
AIM: To summarize the level of knowledge and attitude about HIV/AIDS in seven Arabian Peninsula countries (Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)).
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using combined keywords in four scientific databases of peer-reviewed publications from January 2010 to June 2019. Twenty-five articles were included in the systematic review, and twenty studies in the meta-analysis. The data was analyzed using a random-effect model due to the heterogeneity between the studies.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies reported on the level of knowledge and overall knowledge about HIV/AIDS in this region: 74.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 66.8%-82.0%, p<0.001) and the attitude was 52.8% (95% CI: 36.9%-68.6%, p<0.001). A study from Oman reported higher knowledge levels (95.5%, 95% CI: 94.2%-96.8%) while less than a quarter of the Bahrain population had positive attitudes 22.5% (95% CI: 20.5%-24.5%). Medical doctors showed higher knowledge (94.1%, 95% CI: 92.9%-95.3%), but a positive attitude was only observed in 32.5% (95% CI: 28.8%-36.2%) of the dentists toward HIV/AIDS.
CONCLUSION: The overall knowledge about HIV/AIDS was found to be satisfactory (74.4%), but about half (52.8%) of those displayed negative attitudes toward HIV/AIDS. Regular training courses as well as reviewing and reinforcing HIV/AIDS prevention guidelines can be useful to update knowledge and improve attitudes in this region.",Aldhaleei WA; Bhagavathula AS,2020,Journal of infection and public health,13,7,939-948,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.002,"Aldhaleei, W.

38423978,[Not Available].,"Despite progress in the detection and treatment of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), major challenges remain in developing countries due to insufficient resources and infrastructure. The number of people living with HIV who do not know their serostatus has fallen worldwide. However, a number of existing obstacles stand in the way of better results. The socio-cultural context in Africa hampers knowledge and understanding of the disease, leading to stigmatizing attitudes, reluctance to undergo screening and poor access to treatment.Inequalities also exist within the countries of the North, as in the case of the French West Indies, which benefit from a policy to combat HIV/AIDS, with results that fall short of those in mainland France. For this reason, we have chosen to compare the situation in the West Indies with that in Benin, in the context of African culture.Our analysis takes stock of the issues and prospects linked to the accessibility and use of screening care in sub-Saharan Africa and the French Departments of America (DFA).In both cases, fear of the disease, stigmatization, fear of a positive HIV test result and fear of disclosing the test result limit preventive and treatment actions for an effective fight against HIV.In sub-Saharan Africa, women are more likely to accept a screening test than men. Certain populations, including adolescents and homosexuals, are in a vulnerable position. The comparison reveals similar attitudes and suggests actions or recommendations in both countries that have produced results.Innovative strategies and specific programs must be implemented to turn the tide in the fight against the HIV epidemic.",Kêdoté NM; Duguet AM; Agbahoungba JG; Gangbo FA,2024,Journal international de bioethique et d'ethique des sciences,34,3,47-68,10.3917/jibes.343.0047,"Kêdoté, N.

34895254,HIV/AIDS late presentation and its associated factors in China from 2010 to 2020: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Late presentation to HIV/AIDS care presents serious health concerns, like increased transmission and high healthcare costs, increased mortality, early development of opportunistic infection, increased risk of antiretroviral therapy drug resistance. Despite the effort to contain the HIV/AIDS epidemic, LP has remained an impediment to individual immune reconstitution and public health.
OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to estimate the prevalence and determine the factors associated with late presentation to HIV/AIDS care.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Wanfang, and Weipu database for articles published from 2010 to 2020. We utilized I2 statistics and Q-test to estimate heterogeneity between studies. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to calculate the aggregate odds ratio of late presentation to HIV/AIDS care.
RESULTS: Of 9563 titles and abstracts retrieved, 189 were identified as potentially eligible and 39 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of late presentation to HIV/AIDS care was 43.26%. The major risk factors were patients ≥ 50 years old (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.85-2.58; I2 = 97.44%), married (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.35-1.68; I2 = 96.58%), with heterosexual contact as risk factor for infection (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.73-2.11; I2 = 90.74%) and diagnosed in medical institutions (OR = 2.35,95% CI: 2.11-2.62; I2 = 96.05%). In middle or low HIV prevalence areas, patients ≥ 50 years old (P = 0.01), married (P < 0.01) and diagnosed in medical institutions (P = 0.01) were more likely to be presented late than in high prevalence areas. From 2016-2020, the OR of patients who were married and diagnosed in medical facilities were significantly lower than before (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Patients ≥ 50 years old, married, with heterosexual contact as risk factor for infection, and diagnosed in medical institutions were risk factors of LP. Gender had no significant relationship with LP. In middle or low prevalence areas, patients who were ≥ 50 years old, married, and diagnosed in medical institutions were more likely to be presented late than in other areas. Married patients and those diagnosed in medical institutions after 2015 have a lower risk of LP than before.",Sun C; Li J; Liu X; Zhang Z; Qiu T; Hu H; Wang Y; Fu G,2021,AIDS research and therapy,18,1,96,10.1186/s12981-021-00415-2,"Sun, C., Li, J., Liu, X., Zhang, Z., Qiu, T., Hu, H., Wang, Y., & Fu, G.

35305282,AIDS cases in Ottawa: A review of simultaneous HIV and AIDS diagnoses.,"OBJECTIVES: In Canada, HIV diagnoses continue unabated, with many of these cases being identified at a late stage of infection. While current public health surveillance data does not capture timing of diagnoses, locally, we identified a number of patients concurrently diagnosed with AIDS and HIV.
DESIGN: To understand the key characteristics, presenting symptoms, and risk factors associated with an AIDS diagnosis, we undertook a prospective chart review of HIV and AIDS diagnoses in Ottawa, Canada.
SAMPLE: Sixty seven charts of persons diagnosed with HIV and AIDS between 2015 and 2021 were reviewed.
MEASUREMENTS: Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Results show some inconsistencies regarding HIV risk factors identified in published literature compared to those for persons diagnosed with AIDS in this study. Namely, patients in this review were more likely to be male, Black (from HIV-endemic regions), and heterosexual, and were diagnosed at critical stage in infection (total average CD4+ count of 92.9 cells/mm3 ) with 44.8% of patients concurrently diagnosed with one or more AIDS-related opportunistic infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings can be applied to strengthen HIV screening efforts in primary care settings, particularly among patients who present with persistent symptoms or illnesses related to chronic HIV infection. Additional considerations should be made for public health nurses to provide counseling and linkage to HIV testing/prevention services for patients at the time of an STI or Tuberculosis diagnosis and to increase AIDS-specific data collection.",Orser L; O'Byrne P; Holmes D,2022,"Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",39,5,909-916,10.1111/phn.13065,"Orser, L., O'Byrne, P., & Holmes, D.

37474958,Temporal trend analysis of the HIV/AIDS burden before and after the implementation of antiretroviral therapy at the population level from 1990 to 2020 in Ghana.,"BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has helped reduce the burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the majority of countries. Its contribution to the HIV/AIDS burden in Ghana is still understudied. This study examined HIV/AIDS trends in Ghana before (1990-2004) and after (2004-2020) the implementation and expansion of ART.
METHODS: We obtained HIV/AIDS epidemiology and treatment data for the years 1990-2020 from the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. We investigated the impact of the ART rollout on HIV/AIDS in Ghana using Joinpoint regression models.
RESULTS: The HIV incidence, prevalence, and AIDS-related deaths decreased significantly after 2004, as ART coverage increased from 1% to 2004 to 60% in 2020. The HIV incidence decreased by approximately 3% (AAPC = -2.6%; 95% CI: -3.2, -1.9) per year from 1990 to 2004 and approximately 5% (AAPC = -4.5%; 95% CI: -4.9, -4.2) per year from 2004 to 2020. Between 1990 and 2004, the HIV prevalence increased by approximately 5% (AAPC = 4.7%; 95% CI: 3.6, 5.8) per year but decreased by 2% (AAPC = -1.9%; 95% CI: -2.1, -1.6) per year between 2004 and 2020. Between 1990 and 2004, the annual increase in AIDS-related mortality was 14% (AAPC = 13.8%; 95% CI: 12.6, 15.0), but between 2004 and 2020, it decreased at nearly a 4% (AAPC= -3.6%; 95% CI: -4.7, -2.5) annual rate.
CONCLUSIONS: We found trends indicating progress in Ghana's fight against HIV/AIDS. However, the most significant declines occurred after the introduction of ART, suggesting that the scale-up of ART may have contributed to the decline in HIV/AIDS in Ghana. We advocate for the rapid expansion of ART in Ghana.",Boah M; Yeboah D; Kpordoxah MR; Issah AN; Adokiya MN,2023,BMC public health,23,1,1399,10.1186/s12889-023-16321-3,"Boah, M., Yeboah, D., Kpordoxah, M.

METHODS: A people living with HIV/AIDS retrospective cohort study was in Liuzhou City from April 2006 to December 2020. The information was obtained from the National Comprehensive AIDS Prevention and Control Information System. Life tables and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to calculate participant survival rates and time. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to investigate the factors related to survival.
RESULTS: 18,543 participants were included in this study. In four periods, the 1-year survival rates were 81%, 87%, 95%, and 95%. The 2-year survival rates were 76%, 85%, 93%, and 94%. The 3-year survival rates were 73%, 84%, 92%, and 94%. Results of multivariate Cox regression showed that sex, age of HIV diagnosis, ethnicity, household registration, occupation, marital status, the timing of treatment, education level, route of HIV transmission, whether receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the count of CD4+T cells at baseline (count of CD4+T cells at HIV diagnosis) were factors that are significantly correlated with mortality caused by HIV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: With the Guidelines updated from 2006 to 2020, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates of people living with HIV/AIDS in four periods tended to increase. The timing of treatment initiation of the updated edition of the AIDS Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Guidelines) significantly prolonged the survival time of people living with HIV/AIDS.",Ke S; Fang Q; Lan J; Qiao N; Zhang X; Xie C; Fan Y,2023,BMC public health,23,1,1745,10.1186/s12889-023-15662-3,"Ke, S., Fang, Q., Lan, J., Qiao, N., Zhang, X., Xie, C., & Fan, Y.

32420917,Therapies for tuberculosis and AIDS: myeloid-derived suppressor cells in focus.,"The critical role of suppressive myeloid cells in immune regulation has come to the forefront in cancer research, with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as a main oncology immunotherapeutic target. Recent improvement and standardization of criteria classifying tumor-induced MDSCs have led to unified descriptions and also promoted MDSC research in tuberculosis (TB) and AIDS. Despite convincing evidence on the induction of MDSCs by pathogen-derived molecules and inflammatory mediators in TB and AIDS, very little attention has been given to their therapeutic modulation or roles in vaccination in these diseases. Clinical manifestations in TB are consequences of complex host-pathogen interactions and are substantially affected by HIV infection. Here we summarize the current understanding and knowledge gaps regarding the role of MDSCs in HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (co)infections. We discuss key scientific priorities to enable application of this knowledge to the development of novel strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and/or implementation of enhanced treatment approaches. Building on recent findings and potential for cross-fertilization between oncology and infection biology, we highlight current challenges and untapped opportunities for translating new advances in MDSC research into clinical applications for TB and AIDS.",Dorhoi A; Kotzé LA; Berzofsky JA; Sui Y; Gabrilovich DI; Garg A; Hafner R; Khader SA; Schaible UE; Kaufmann SH; Walzl G; Lutz MB; Mahon RN; Ostrand-Rosenberg S; Bishai W; du Plessis N,2020,The Journal of clinical investigation,130,6,2789-2799,10.1172/JCI136288,"Dorhoi, A., Kotzé, L.

39473361,"Framing HIV and AIDS in competitive authoritarian democracies. Case study of the print press in Mozambique, 1986-2020.","Mozambique has the sixth highest prevalence of HIV in the world and ranks fourth in new infections. The government-owned print press Notícias has played an important role in the social construction of HIV and AIDS in the country as it was entrusted with the role of disseminating HIV and AIDS information to the public since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country in 1986. Using Notícias' articles and frame analysis perspective, the article analyses the way Notícias has framed HIV and AIDS in the country since the late 1980s. The choice of media results from the fact that the way a phenomenon is constructed influences the way it is understood, as well as the way people may behave before it. The study found that Notícias' frames on HIV and AIDS have suffered from a threefold tension: the need to maintain the Frelimo government's former centralised and grassroots-orientated socialist ideology of health services in the context of the liberal market; the need to balance the influence of the global multilateral and bilateral actors and the Frelimo government's political interest of translating HIV and AIDS response to the Mozambican context; and the need to portray a nationalist and positive image of the government's performance in HIV and AIDS response before Mozambique's non-fully plausible societal practices for an effective HIV and AIDS response. In a top-down approach, Notícias' frames reflect not only the African post-independence ancillary and nationalist role of government-owned print press but also the power of global actors.

37254121,Prevalence and variability of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments negatively affect treatment adherence, viral load suppression, CD4 count, functionality, and the overall quality of life of people with seropositive status. However, huge variability is observed across primary studies regarding the prevalence and determinants of neurocognitive impairment in people with HIV/AIDS. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to determine the pooled prevalence of neurocognitive impairment and identify factors contributing to variations in its estimate among people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of scientific databases (Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and EMBASE) was performed from inception onward. Google and Google Scholar were also searched for grey literature. Research articles available until July 15, 2022 were included. We used STATA-version 14 statistical software for analysis. A random effect model was executed to pool the reported prevalence of neurocognitive impairments. Subgroup analysis was done to show variations in the prevalence of neurocognitive impairments and factors that might contribute to these variations.
RESULTS: A literature search resulted in 8,047 articles. After the removal of duplications and thorough evaluation, a total of 49 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments was highly variable across studies, ranging from 14% to 88%, yielding the pooled prevalence of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairment to be 46.34% [95% CI (40.32, 52.36)] and I2 = 98.5% with a P-value of 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa have HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairment. This illustrates the need to establish practical approaches to early identification and effective control of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments. However, there were variabilities in the reported prevalence of HIV/AIDS-associated neurocognitive impairments across studies. This further demonstrates the need to have consistent measurement approaches.

Since that time and over the following 30 years, World Workshops on oral HIV have been held every four years or so. The aims of the first and all subsequent Workshops were to bring together clinicians and non-clinical scientists who have an interest in the oral manifestations of HIV disease, to share worldwide perspectives, knowledge and understanding of oral health and disease in HIV infection, to agree on global definitions and classifications of oral diseases and to identify research needs taking account of the worldwide perspectives and opportunities. Thus, there have been clinical science, social science and basic science aspects of each World Workshop. The Workshops have achieved their aims and have had impact in all three fields, leading to robust research agendas, changes in national HIV policies and international collaborations. They have led to policy declarations of access to oral care as a basic human right for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals and advancing the rights of all HIV-positive healthcare workers to perform clinical practice.",Greenspan JS; Challacombe SJ,2020,Oral diseases,26 Suppl 1,,3-8,10.1111/odi.13385,"Greenspan, J.

40641200,Bridging Palliative Care and HIV/AIDS: A Call for Integrated Approaches.,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) remain significant global health challenges. Beyond the physical manifestations, individuals living with HIV/AIDS often grapple with psychological burdens, notably anxiety, which can adversely affect their quality of life (QoL) and physiological stress markers, such as cortisol levels. Palliative care, traditionally associated with end-of-life support, has evolved to address the multifaceted needs of chronic illness patients, including those with HIV/AIDS. In the world, 1.89 million individuals require palliative care due to pain, and around 2.7 million people have HIV. This editorial explores the role of palliative care in enhancing QoL and modulating cortisol levels among HIV/AIDS patients experiencing anxiety. Palliative care is holistic, addressing physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. In the context of HIV/AIDS, palliative interventions have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating symptoms, reducing psychological distress, and improving overall well-being. A systematic review highlighted that home-based palliative care and inpatient hospice services significantly improved patient outcomes in pain management, symptom control, anxiety reduction, and spiritual well-being. Palliative care emerges as a vital component in the comprehensive management of HIV/AIDS, particularly for patients grappling with anxiety. By enhancing quality of life and potentially modulating stress-induced hormonal imbalances, palliative interventions offer a holistic approach that addresses both psychological and physiological aspects of the disease. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which palliative care influences cortisol levels and exploring its long-term benefits on disease progression and patient well-being.",Putranto R,2025,Acta medica Indonesiana,57,2,151-152,,"Putranto, R.

40755211,The HIV/AIDS pandemic: where are we now?,"The global HIV/AIDS response is facing its most serious crisis in decades. Despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the growing availability of prevention tools such as oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and long-acting PrEP, progress toward the UNAIDS 2025 targets has stalled. HIV incidence remains unacceptably high across key populations and geographic regions, while treatment coverage gaps and preventable deaths persist. The abrupt 2025 suspension of U.S. foreign aid programs, including the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has further disrupted service delivery, particularly for prevention programs and marginalized groups. This editorial assesses the underlying structural, political, and programmatic failures that led to missed targets and highlights the compounded risks posed by policy reversals. Drawing on recent epidemiological data and modeling, we estimate the impact of prevention gaps, disparities in access, and policy changes on global HIV trajectories. We argue that a path forward requires reforms, renewed political will, and sustainable financing. In a moment of rising global polarization and shrinking public health budgets, the HIV response must be reimagined around equity, inclusion, and collective action.

35069778,HIV/AIDS-Pneumonia Codynamics Model Analysis with Vaccination and Treatment.,"In this paper, we proposed and analyzed a realistic compartmental mathematical model on the spread and control of HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic incorporating pneumonia vaccination and treatment for both infections at each infection stage in a population. The model exhibits six equilibriums: HIV/AIDS only disease-free, pneumonia only disease-free, HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic disease-free, HIV/AIDS only endemic, pneumonia only endemic, and HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic endemic equilibriums. The HIV/AIDS only submodel has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if R 1 < 1. Using center manifold theory, we have verified that both the pneumonia only submodel and the HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coepidemic model undergo backward bifurcations whenever R 2 < 1 and R 3 = max{R 1, R 2} < 1, respectively. Thus, for pneumonia infection and HIV/AIDS-pneumonia coinfection, the requirement of the basic reproduction numbers to be less than one, even though necessary, may not be sufficient to completely eliminate the disease. Our sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the pneumonia disease transmission rate β 2 and the HIV/AIDS transmission rate β 1 play an important role to change the qualitative dynamics of HIV/AIDS and pneumonia coinfection. The pneumonia infection transmission rate β 2 gives rises to the possibility of backward bifurcation for HIV/AIDS and pneumonia coinfection if R 3 = max{R 1, R 2} < 1, and hence, the existence of multiple endemic equilibria some of which are stable and others are unstable. Using standard data from different literatures, our results show that the complete HIV/AIDS and pneumonia coinfection model reproduction number is R 3 = max{R 1, R 2} = max{1.386, 9.69 } = 9.69 at β 1 = 2 and β 2 = 0.2 which shows that the disease spreads throughout the community. Finally, our numerical simulations show that pneumonia vaccination and treatment against disease have the effect of decreasing pneumonia and coepidemic disease expansion and reducing the progression rate of HIV infection to the AIDS stage.",Teklu SW; Rao KP,2022,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022,,3105734,10.1155/2022/3105734,"Teklu, S.

35776707,Predicting the HIV/AIDS epidemic and measuring the effect of AIDS Conquering Project in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.,"To control the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China, Guangxi government launched the 5-year Guangxi AIDS Conquering Project (GACP, Phase I: 2010-2014, Phase II: 2015-2020). In the project, three measures are implemented, such as great improvements of the coverage of HIV/AIDS education, promotion of HIV voluntary counseling and testing, and enhancement of antiretroviral treatment. In this paper, we explore the effects of the three measures of GACP by construction of a Susceptible-Infected-Diagnosed-Treated population compartments model and via evaluation of the basic reproduction number derived from the model. A computational framework is developed for estimating the model parameters based on the HIV surveillance data, with application of the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method and Nonlinear Least Squares method. By estimating the new infections and evaluating the basic reproduction number, we find that the implementation of the three measures of GACP has a significant effect on controlling the rise of HIV/AIDS cases and the epidemic trend. Compared with HIV voluntary counseling and testing, strengthening HIV/AIDS education and expanding the coverage of antiretroviral treatment show a greater impact on HIV/AIDS epidemic control, which provides a reference project for other provinces with a similar epidemic situation in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

38117745,"Beyond the discourses of policy and power: HIV, AIDS, and community perspectives on the lived pandemic.","As HIV unfolded in the 1980s, HIV and AIDS were heard and seen through the lives of those whom it touched directly. Personal histories were foregrounded, centred by the inevitable mortality attached to HIV infection, the courage of circumstance in the face of illness, and the activism necessary to make a difference. In the later part of the decade, the impacts of HIV were most apparent in East Africa, where community responses and political leadership coalesced to reduce new HIV infections. The 1990s marked a turn towards centralised policy, funding, and the reification of biomedically oriented approaches and systems that are intrinsically top-down. This biomedical turn centred on foregrounding the widespread availability of low-cost antiretroviral therapy and was articulated in the 90-90-90 and subsequent targets. Biomedicalisation reinforces individualised approaches to health primarily focused on biomedical technologies and health service provision that do not rely on community or social organisation formats. Emphasis on HIV treatment, along with the promise of reduced HIV transmission through viral load suppression, contributed to limiting socio-behavioural approaches to HIV prevention. While the importance of community-led response was highlighted in the 2016 United Nations Political Declaration on Ending AIDS, community-led response has devolved towards concepts such as community-led monitoring and community-led response that frame responses in direct relation to the dominant biomedical paradigm. There are lessons in the history of the AIDS response that demonstrate that communities formulate responses to AIDS differently when there have been opportunities for community members to determine the pathways for action to address HIV independently. Older research studies offer retrospective insights into moments in the history of HIV when communities were foregrounded and highlighted the need to reconsider the current trajectory of the HIV response. Not only for history's sake but to acknowledge that community leadership remains overwhelmed by elites. While lofty targets and goals drive the contemporary HIV response, the way forward is mired by uncertainty. HIV prevention efforts remain uneven, and millions of people living with HIV depend on access to treatment for decades to come in the context of budgetary uncertainties. Changing the course of AIDS will not be achieved if we fail to ensure that communities occupy a genuine and unambiguous place in shaping HIV response.",Parker W,2023,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,22,4,261-268,10.2989/16085906.2023.2289392,"Parker, W.

38334114,'Ending AIDS' between comparison and commensuration and the role of global health indicators.,"The use of targets and indicators in global health has become ubiquitous within global health and disease elimination programmes. The drive to 'end AIDS' has become a global flagship endeavour, including nation-states, donor organisations, NGOs, pharmaceutical companies, medical researchers, and activists. Almost synonymous with the campaign of ending AIDS is UNAIDS' 90-90-90 targets. Beyond indicators' role in neoliberal global health, an essential aspect of indicators and quantitative metrics is their ability to provide a basis for measurements and comparability across time and between different actors and entities. These processes are based on what has been called, commensuration, visual simplification, and serialisation. This article seeks to provide an account of how we can think about indicators in the drive to end AIDS as doing work that is contingent upon commensuration, simplification, and serialisation. The argument is that by attending to issues of commensuration, visual simplification, and serialisation we are better able to see how we risk erasing and foreclosing other forms of conceptualising what the end of AIDS could be. Logics of quantification risks erasing and foreclosing other qualitative aspects of the HIV epidemic as well as obscuring various epistemological tensions inherent in counting towards the end of AIDS.",Sandset T,2024,Global public health,19,1,2312435,10.1080/17441692.2024.2312435,"Sandset, T.

36309647,Establishment and evaluation of a CT-based radiomic model for AIDS-associated pulmonary cryptococcosis.,"BACKGROUND: Establish a CT-based diagnostic radiomic model for AIDS complicated with pulmonary cryptococcosis and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of this model.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 98 AIDS patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis and 103 AIDS patients with other infections or neoplastic lesions, comprising a total of 699 lesions. Patients were randomly divided into a training group and test group at a ratio of 2.75:1. Features from all lesions, cavity lesions and solid nodule lesions were extracted, and two kinds of radiomic models (6 types) were established. ROC curves were drawn, and the sensitivity and specificity were calculated to compare the SVM model and LR model, radiologists' empirical diagnoses and the combination of these empirical diagnoses with the radiomic model.
RESULTS: The AUCs of senior radiologist for all lesions and cavity lesions were lower than those of the SVM and LR models. The diagnostic efficacy of primary radiologist was lower than that of both of the other model types. The diagnostic efficacy of the LR model was relatively stable, with the highest diagnostic efficiency of the 3 model/radiologist groups. The AUCs of intermediate radiologist in combination with the LR radiomic model for all lesions, nodular lesions and cavity lesions were 0.88, 0.84, and 0.9, respectively, which were the highest among all models and radiologists.
CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based radiomic LR model of AIDS-associated pulmonary cryptococcosis exhibits good diagnostic performance, which was similar to that of senior radiologists and higher than that of the primary radiologist. With the help of a radiomic model, radiologists can achieve improved diagnostic accuracy compared to that when only an empirical diagnosis is used.",Zhang ZX; Mu XY; Yu J; Guan CS; Chen BD; Xie RM,2022,BMC medical imaging,22,1,185,10.1186/s12880-022-00910-6,"Zhang, Z.

METHOD: This retrospective study, from 2009 to 2022, aims to compare the survival analyses of pulmonary nocardiosis in AIDS and non-AIDS patients in northeastern Thailand.
RESULTS: A total of 215 culture-confirmed cases of pulmonary nocardiosis: 97 with AIDS and 118 without AIDS. The median CD4 count of AIDS patients was 11 cells/μL (range: 1-198), and 33% had concurrent opportunistic infections. 63.6% of 118 non-AIDS patients received immunosuppressive medications, 28.8% had comorbidities, and 7.6% had no coexisting conditions. Disseminated nocardiosis and pleural effusion were more prevalent among AIDS patients, whereas non-AIDS patients revealed more shock and respiratory failure. One hundred-fifty patients underwent brain imaging; 15 (10%) had brain abscesses. Patients with pulmonary nocardiosis have overall 30-day and 1-year mortality rates of 38.5% (95% CI: 32.3%, 45.4%) and 52.1% (95% CI: 45.6%, 58.9%), respectively. The Cox survival analysis showed that AIDS patients with disseminated nocardiosis had a 7.93-fold (95% CI: 2.61-24.02, p < 0.001) increased risk of death within 30 days compared to non-AIDS patients when considering variables such as age, Charlson comorbidity index, concurrent opportunistic infections, duration of illness, shock, respiratory failure, multi-lobar pneumonia, lung abscesses, and combination antibiotic therapy.

36910027,"Qualitative analysis of HIV and AIDS disease transmission: impact of awareness, testing and effective follow up.","Background: Since the early 1980s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its accompanying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have spread worldwide, becoming one of the world's major global health issues. From the beginning of the epidemic until 2020, about 79.3 million people became infected, with 36.3 million deaths due to AIDS illnesses. This huge figure is a result of those unaware of their status due to stigmatization and invariably spreading the virus unknowingly. Methods: Qualitative analysis through a mathematical model that will address HIV unaware individuals and the effect of an increasing defaulter on the dynamics of HIV/AIDS was investigated. The impact of treatment and the effect of inefficient follow-up on the transmission of HIV/AIDS were examined. The threshold for the effective reduction of the unaware status of HIV through testing, in response to awareness, and the significance of effective non-defaulting in treatment commonly called defaulters loss to follow-up as these individuals contribute immensely to the spread of the virus due to their increase in CD4+ count was determined in this study. Stability analysis of equilibrium points is performed using the basic reproduction number $R_0$, an epidemiological threshold that determines disease eradication or persistence in viral populations. We tested the most sensitive parameters in the basic reproduction numbers. Results: The results portray that early identification and treatment only are inadequate for the illness to be eradicated, but effectively used of condom, strict adherence to treatment and counseling of and testing of pregnant women contribute to a decrease in infected HIV individuals. Conclusions: Other control techniques, such as treatment adherence and effective condom usage, and reduction in vertical transmission cannot be over-emphasis to lessen the disease's burden.

Smoking-attributable deaths were calculated by multiplying the SAFs by deaths among gay and bisexual men. Deaths from HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men was obtained from the California Department of Public Health. Future deaths from smoking and HIV/AIDS were projected using regression equations based on time trends.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2014, smoking caused over 6800 deaths among gay and bisexual men, while nearly 9500 died from HIV/AIDS. Mortality from both causes has been falling, but deaths from HIV/AIDS have been falling more rapidly. Projections suggest that in the mid-2040s, more gay/bisexual men will die from smoking than from HIV/AIDS.
CONCLUSION: Smoking will surpass HIV/AIDS as a cause of death among gay and bisexual men in California within a few decades. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community was highly effective in drawing attention and resources to the fight against HIV/AIDS, saving untold lives by hastening effective treatments. Lessons learnt in the fight against AIDS should be used to help fight the tobacco epidemic.",Max WB; Stark BB; Sung HY; Offen NB,2020,Tobacco control,29,3,305-311,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054850,"Max, W.

39508244,"Social support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and self-management behaviors among people living with HIV/AIDS in China: a structural equation modeling analysis.","BACKGROUND: Understanding the psychosocial factors influencing self-management behaviors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is crucial for effective medical interventions and improving their quality of life. However, few studies have explored the psychosocial mechanisms influencing self-management behaviors among PLWHA in China. This study, conducted in accordance with STROBE guidelines, uses SEM to explore the roles of social support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in predicting self-management behaviors among Chinese PLWHA.
METHODS: From March 2023 to July 2023, a convenience sample of 282 PLWHA, recruited from one designated AIDS hospital and one Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Sichuan Province, China, was surveyed. Data were collected via four validated self-report scales (the Social Support Rating Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Self-Esteem Scale, and the HIV/AIDS Patient Self-Management Scale). Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relationships among social support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and self-management behaviors.
RESULTS: The new model demonstrated acceptable fit parameters (χ2/df = 2.15, GFI = 0.96, AGFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.93, IFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.05). The direct effect of social support on self-management behaviors was significant (β = 0.117, P < 0.05). In addition, self-efficacy and self-esteem played significant mediating roles in the influence of social support on self-management behaviors, accounting for 38.73% and 22.79% of the total effect, respectively. Moreover, they served as chain mediators, contributing 9.80% to the total effect.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychosocial dynamics influencing self-management behavior in Chinese PLWHA and have broader implications for populations in other countries. Targeted interventions that enhance social support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem could be applied in various cultural contexts to improve self-management practices among PLWHA globally.",Huang H; Tu L; Zhang X; Zhang L; Zhang J; Liu Q; Liu Q; Liu Y; Chen H,2024,BMC public health,24,1,3070,10.1186/s12889-024-20541-6,"Huang, H., Tu, L., Zhang, X., Zhang, L., Zhang, J., Liu, Q., Liu, Q., Liu, Y., & Chen, H.

Although some countries are experiencing an upward trend in HIV infections, there has been a lack of studies assessing the global burden of HIV/AIDS acquired through sexual transmission. We assessed the global, regional, and national burdens of HIV/AIDS acquired through sexual transmission from 1990 to 2019. Methods Data on deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of HIV/AIDS acquired through sexual transmission in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. The burdens and trends were evaluated using the age-standardised rates (ASR) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Results Globally, HIV/AIDS acquired through sexual transmission accounted for ~695.8 thousand (95% uncertainty interval 628.0-811.3) deaths, 33.0million (28.7-39.9) YLLs, 3.4million (2.4-4.6) YLDs, and 36.4million (32.2-43.1) DALYs in 2019. In 2019, Southern sub-Saharan Africa (11350.94), Eastern sub-Saharan Africa (3530.91), and Western sub-Saharan Africa (2037.74) had the highest ASR of DALYs of HIV/AIDS acquired through sexual transmission per 100,000. In most regions of the world, the burden of HIV/AIDS acquired through sexual transmission has been increasing from 1990 to 2019, mainly in Oceania (EAPC 17.20, 95% confidence interval 12.82-21.75), South Asia (9.00, 3.94-14.30), and Eastern Europe (7.09, 6.35-7.84).

32251069,Depressive Disorders in HIV/AIDS: A Clinically Focused Narrative Review.,"After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:• Assess strategies for diagnosing depressive disorders in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)• Identify factors that contribute to the development of depressive disorders in HIV/AIDS• Evaluate strategies for managing depressive disorders in HIV/AIDS ABSTRACT: Depressive disorders and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) are associated with major socioeconomic burdens. The negative impact of depressive disorders on HIV/AIDS is well known, including on treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, depressive disorders are underdiagnosed and undertreated in seropositive persons. This review summarizes clinically useful information on depressive disorders in HIV/AIDS. More specifically, we address assessment, differential diagnosis, contributing factors, management, and common challenges in the treatment of depressive disorders in seropositive individuals. Assessment and diagnosis of depression may be challenging in seropositive persons because of several biopsychosocial particularities associated with HIV/AIDS. One of the difficulties is the overlap between depression and HIV/AIDS symptoms, particularly in individuals with advanced AIDS, requiring consideration of a broad differential diagnosis. Several factors related to HIV/AIDS status contribute to the higher rates of depressive disorders, including infectious-immunological, psychosocial, and exogenous factors. The treatment of depressive disorders in HIV/AIDS involves three groups of interventions: (1) pharmacological interventions, (2) psychotherapeutic interventions, and (3) management of other contributing factors. Challenges in management include poor adherence to treatment and the risk of suicide. We provide evidence-based recommendations to improve assessment and management of depressive disorders in seropositive persons.",Medeiros GC; Smith FA; Trivedi MH; Beach SR,2020,Harvard review of psychiatry,28,3,146-158,10.1097/HRP.0000000000000252,"Medeiros, G.

Reaching back to the Plague of Athens, my essay elaborates on Rosenberg's dramaturgy by questioning whether blame, division, and collective violence were so universal or even the dominant ""acts"" of epidemics not only before the nineteenth century but to the present. Instead, with certain pandemics such as yellow fever in the Deep South or the Great Influenza of 1918-20, unity, mass volunteerism, and self-abnegation played leading roles. Finally, not all epidemics ended ""with a whimper"" as attested by the long early modern history of plague. These often concluded literally with a bang: lavish planning of festivals of thanksgiving, choreographed with processions, innumerable banners, commissions of paintings, ex-voto churches, trumpets, tambourines, artillery fire, and fireworks.",Cohn SK,2020,Bulletin of the history of medicine,94,4,578-589,10.1353/bhm.2020.0083,"Cohn, S.

32892711,Individual and contextual predictors of comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge among young females in Ghana.,"Sub-Saharan Africa is a region that is severely affected by the HIV and AIDS pandemic with females disproportionately affected. Having accurate and comprehensive knowledge about HIV and AIDS is a major strategy in the fight against the pandemic. This study sought to examine the individual and contextual predictors of comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge among young women in Ghana. The study used the females' file from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey dataset. A total of 1 407 young women were used for the analysis. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were done. The results showed that about 22% of the respondents had comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge. Young women with secondary and higher levels of education (AOR = 2.85, p < 0.01) and those from the Upper East Region (AOR = 7.15, p < 0.001) had higher odds of comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge. However, those cohabiting (AOR = 0.57, p < 0.01) and those who do not watch TV at all (AOR = 0.50, p < 0.01) had lower odds of comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge. Comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge is low among young women in Ghana and the predictors are both individual (marital status and education) and contextual (region, watching television and listening to radio). A concerted effort is needed to improve the HIV and AIDS knowledge of young people. Mass media campaigns aimed at improving comprehensive HIV and AIDS knowledge should appreciate the individual and contextual factors that influence the comprehensive HIV & AIDS knowledge of young women.",Darteh EK,2020,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,19,3,222-230,10.2989/16085906.2020.1802307,"Darteh, E.

34360891,HIV-Associated Cancer Biomarkers: A Requirement for Early Diagnosis.,"Globally, HIV/AIDS and cancer are increasingly public health problems and continue to exist as comorbidities. The sub-Saharan African region has the largest number of HIV infections. Malignancies previously associated with HIV/AIDS, also known as the AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) have been documented to decrease, while the non-AIDS defining cancer (NADCs) are on the rise. On the other hand, cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and precision oncology as the most effective cancer therapy is gaining attraction. Among HIV-infected individuals, the increased risk for developing cancer is due to the immune system of the patient being suppressed, frequent coinfection with oncogenic viruses and an increase in risky behavior such as poor lifestyle. The core of personalised medicine for cancer depends on the discovery and the development of biomarkers. Biomarkers are specific and highly sensitive markers that reveal information that aid in leading to the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of the disease. This review focuses mainly on the risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic role of various cancer biomarkers in HIV-positive patients. A careful selection of sensitive and specific HIV-associated cancer biomarkers is required to identify patients at most risk of tumour development, thus improving the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.",Dlamini Z; Mbele M; Makhafola TJ; Hull R; Marima R,2021,International journal of molecular sciences,22,15,,10.3390/ijms22158127,"Dlamini, Z., Mbele, M., Makhafola, T.

38387533,The global burden of HIV.,"The global burden of HIV remains a formidable challenge, affecting millions. Despite significant progress in understanding, treatment, and prevention , HIV/AIDS continues to exert a substantial impact on personal and public health, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence is highest. HIV not only poses a direct threat to the well-being of individuals but also contributes to social and economic disparities. Approximately 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV, with millions unaware of their status. Stigma and discrimination still hinder testing, starting and staying on treatment. Access to antiretroviral therapy has improved, yet disparities persist, with marginalized communities often facing barriers to essential health care services. Efforts to reduce new HIV infections and transmission include comprehensive prevention strategies, education, and increased access to testing and treatment. Addressing social determinants, reducing stigma, and ensuring equitable access to health care remain crucial to reach the ambitious goal of ending AIDS by 2030.",Payagala S; Pozniak A,2024,Clinics in dermatology,42,2,119-127,10.1016/j.clindermatol.2024.02.001,"Payagala, S., & Pozniak, A.

32999052,Understanding and comparing HIV-related law and policy environments: cross-national data and accountability for the global AIDS response.,"Law and policy differences help explain why, as HIV-related science has advanced swiftly, some countries have realised remarkable progress on AIDS while others see expanding epidemics. We describe the structure and findings of a new dataset and research platform, the HIV Policy Lab, which fills an important knowledge gap by measuring the HIV-related policy environment across 33 indicators and 194 countries over time, with online access and visualisation. Cross-national indicators can be critical tools in international governance-building social power to monitor state behaviour with the potential to change policy and improve domestic accountability. This new and evolving effort collects data about policy through review of legal documents, official government reports and systematic review of secondary sources. Alignment between national policy environments and global norms is demonstrated through comparison with international public health guidance and agreements. We demonstrate substantial variation in the content of law and policies between countries, regions and policy areas. Given progress in basic and implementation science, it would be tempting to believe most countries have adopted policies aligned with global norms, with a few outliers. Data show this is not the case. Globally, alignment is higher on clinical and treatment policies than on prevention, testing and structural policies. Policy-makers, researchers, civil society, finance agencies and others can use these data to better understand the policy environment within and across countries and support reform. Longitudinal analysis enables evaluation of the impact of laws and policies on HIV outcomes and research about the political drivers of policy choice.",Kavanagh MM; Graeden E; Pillinger M; Singh R; Eaneff S; Bendaud V; Gustav R; Erkkola T,2020,BMJ global health,5,9,,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003695,"Kavanagh, M.

36446878,Incorporating social determinants of health into the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS.,"Currently, it is estimated that 37.6 million people are living with the HIV/AIDS virus worldwide, placing HIV/AIDS among the ten leading causes of death, mostly among low- and lower-middle-income countries. Despite the effective intervention in the prevention and treatment, this reduction did not occur equally among populations, subpopulations and geographic regions. This difference in the occurrence of the disease is associated with the social determinants of health (SDH), which could affect the transmission and maintenance of HIV. With the recognition of the importance of SDH in HIV transmission, the development of mathematical models that incorporate these determinants could increase the accuracy and robustness of the modeling. This article aims to propose a theoretical and conceptual way of including SDH in the mathematical modeling of HIV/AIDS. The theoretical mathematical model with the Social Determinants of Health has been developed in stages. For the selection of SDH that were incorporated into the model, a narrative literature review was conducted. Secondly, we proposed an extended model in which the population (N) is divided into Susceptible (S), HIV-positive (I), Individual with AIDS (A) and individual under treatment (T). Each SDH had a different approach to embedding in the model. We performed a calibration and validation of the model. A total of 31 SDH were obtained in the review, divided into four groups: Individual Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Social Participation, and Health Services. In the end, four determinants were selected for incorporation into the model: Education, Poverty, Use of Drugs and Alcohol abuse, and Condoms Use. the section ""Numerical simulation"" to simulate the influence of the poverty rate on the AIDS incidence and mortality rates. We used a Brazilian dataset of new AIDS cases and deaths, which is publicly available. We calibrated the model using a multiobjective genetic algorithm for the years 2003 to 2019. To forecast from 2020 to 2035, we assumed two lines of poverty rate representing (i) a scenario of increasing and (ii) a scenario of decreasing. To avoid overfitting, we fixed some parameters and estimated the remaining. The equations presented with the chosen SDH exemplify some approaches that we can adopt when thinking about modeling social effects on the occurrence of HIV. The model was able to capture the influence of the employment/poverty on the HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates, evidencing the importance of SDOH in the occurrence of diseases. The recognition of the importance of including the SDH in the modeling and studies on HIV/AIDS is evident, due to its complexity and multicausality. Models that do not take into account in their structure, will probably miss a great part of the real trends, especially in periods, as the current on, of economic crisis and strong socioeconomic changes.",de Oliveira RB; Rubio FA; Anderle R; Sanchez M; de Souza LE; Macinko J; Dourado I; Rasella D,2022,Scientific reports,12,1,20541,10.1038/s41598-022-24459-0,"de Oliveira, R.

39052562,Incidence and influencing factors related to social isolation among HIV/AIDS patients: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLWH) are susceptible to social isolation as a result of stigma and discrimination, which not only diminishes adherence to antiretroviral therapy but also heightens the risks of hospital readmission, depression, and mortality. However, there is currently no systematic review addressing the occurrence and impact of social isolation in individuals with HIV. Therefore, this study undertook a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to examine the prevalence and influencing factors associated with social isolation among PLWH.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, China Science and Technology Journal Database, The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database will be searched from the establishment of the database to the latest search date. Literature screening, data extraction and literature quality assessment will be done independently by two researchers and results will be cross-referenced. Data analysis will be performed using stata15.1 software. Risk of publication bias will be assessed using Begg's and Egger's methods. Heterogeneity between studies will then be assessed using the I2 index and its 95% CI and Q statistics. Sources of heterogeneity will be accounted for by subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The results may reveal the prevalence of social isolation among PLWH and provide data support for understanding its etiology and prevention.
CONCLUSION: By systematically reviewing the existing literature on social isolation among PLWH, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of social isolation within this population, elucidate the detrimental effects it poses for people affected by HIV, and effectively inform targeted interventions for high-risk groups. Furthermore, these findings offer valuable insights to support evidence-based decision-making in public health policy.

32301309,[Stigma and HIV: relevant for everyone].,"Medical advances in the treatment of HIV over the last 35 years mean that people living with HIV (PLHIV) now have a life expectancy close to that of the general population. Further, when successfully treated, PLHIV cannot transmit the virus. Despite this, HIV-related stigma remains widespread, including within healthcare settings. Stigma is not a vague sociological notion but represents a real threat to public health, with repercussions for both PLHIV and HIV-negative individuals. Stigma has been shown to have a negative impact on HIV prevention, testing, access to health services, and on the healthcare management of PLHIV.

39562191,Forty years of HIV infection and AIDS in Taiwan: Reflection on the past and looking toward the future.,"We review the epidemiology, policies, and control programs of HIV infection in Taiwan in the past 40 years since the first case of HIV infection was diagnosed in 1984. With the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Taiwan in 1997, the incidences of HIV-related opportunistic illnesses and mortality have significantly declined. However, despite improved access to HIV testing and treatment, late presentation of HIV infection remains common. Unprotected sex, particularly among men who have sex with men, continues to be the leading risk for HIV transmission after implementation of harm reduction program to control an outbreak of HIV infection among people who inject drugs that occurred in 2003-2007. The sequential introduction of well-tolerated, effective, single-tablet antiretroviral regimens has facilitated the implementation of ""treat-all"" policy in 2016, rapid ART initiation within 7 days of diagnosis in 2018, and same-day ART initiation in 2021 when immunochromatography was used for rapid confirmation of HIV infection. Government-funded pilot program of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection, which was launched in 2016 followed by wider enrollment of people at high risk for HIV acquisition in 2018, have contributed to sustained declines of the incidence of HIV infection since 2018, along with high rates of linkage to HIV care, ART initiation, viral suppression, and retention in care in Taiwan.

31995011,The Emerging of CRF01_AE: A Clinical Story and Future HIV/AIDS Situation in Thailand.,"The HIV epidemic in Thailand in the 1980's compromised the country's socio-economic development. The epidemic first became evident in the community of men with male sexual partners (MSM), and subsequently spread to intravenous drug users (IVDU), female commercial sex workers (CSW) and their male clients, and, ultimately, to their partners and children. The HIV epidemic has devastated the country's working-age population. The extensive negative impact and social stigma associated with the disease do not only have an impact on the victims of HIV but also on their descendants and relatives. An epicenter of the HIV epidemic has been in the northern provinces of Thailand. An HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE, a complex chimeric virus composed of both A and E subtypes, is prevalent in Northern Thailand. The virus has quickly become a predominant viral strain circulating in Thailand, other neighboring Southeast Asian countries, and China as well as some other countries throughout the world. The epidemiology, evolution, and biology of CRF01_AE offer a unique model for further scientific investigations which would advance the knowledge of and curative strategies against HIV. In addition, Thailand has developed suitable national guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention in order to control the epidemic. Effective antiretroviral drugs are, therefore, able to be made available to those who live with HIV. The national surveillance system has also been effective. The great efforts and resources which Thailand has dedicated to the fight against the epidemic have eventually paid off. In 2010, a plan was proposed to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission and Thailand has become the first country to be effective in this objective. Thailand therefore has become recognized as being the global leader in HIV prevention and treatment. The experience which Thailand has gained from the past and the current research and management strategies of the HIV epidemic has prepared the country for emerging strains of HIV-1 in the future.",Winichakoon P; Tongjai S,2020,Current HIV research,18,2,74-84,10.2174/1570162X18666200129160723,"Winichakoon, P., & Tongjai, S.

Methods: Information of newly reported HIV/AIDS through non-martial and non-commercial heterosexual transmission was collected from National Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Information system, using SPSS 22.0 to analyze the characteristics and tend of cases. Results: During 2015-2020, a total of 10 877 HIV/AIDS cases infected by non-martial and non-commercial heterosexual transmission were newly reported in Henan province. This mode of infection increased from 32.6% in 2015 to 35.5% in 2020 (trend χ2=81.880,P<0.01). The male to female ratio was 1.9∶1 (7 105∶3 772). The mean age was (45.5±15.8) years, increasing annually (F=5.184,P<0.01). For female cases, the proportion of aged 15-50 years group was decreased annually (trend χ2=69.888, P<0.01). Most HIV/AIDS cases were distributed in the early HIV epidemic areas and Zhengzhou city, the same as the cases of the first CD4+T cells counts (CD4) below 200 cells/μl. The median (P25, P75) first CD4 count was 298 (143, 462) cells/μl.

35775967,Epidemiological investigation and proteomic profiling of typical TCM syndrome in HIV/AIDS immunological nonresponders.,"HIV/AIDS pandemic remains the world's most severe public health challenge, especially for HIV/AIDS immunological nonresponders (HIV/AIDS-INRs), who tend to have higher mortality. Due to the advantages in promoting patients' immune reconstitution, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has become one of the mainstays of complementary treatments for HIV/AIDS-INRs. Given that effective TCM treatments largely depend on precise syndrome differentiation, there is an increasing interest in exploring biological evidence for the classification of TCM syndromes in HIV/AIDS-INRs. In our study, to identify the typical HIV/AIDS-INRs syndrome, an epidemiological survey was first conducted in the Liangshan prefecture (China), a high HIV/AIDS prevalence region. The key TCM syndrome, Yang deficiency of spleen and kidney (YDSK), was evaluated by using a tandem mass tag combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (TMT-LC-MS/MS). A total of 62 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of YDSK syndrome compared with healthy people were screened out. Comparative bioinformatics analyses showed that DEPs in YDSK syndrome were mainly associated with response to wounding and acute inflammatory response in the biological process. The pathway annotation is mainly enriched in complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, the YDSK syndrome-specific DEPs such as HP and S100A9 were verified by ELISA, and confirmed as potential biomarkers for YDSK syndrome. Our study may lay the biological and scientific basis for the specificity of TCM syndromes in HIV/AIDs-INRs, and may provide more opportunities for the deep understanding of TCM syndromes and the developing more effective and stable TCM treatment for HIV/AIDS-INRs.",Ji SX; Zheng YF; Li X; Li BX; Zou JX; Wang YT; Xia XY; Chen X; Hu QN; Wan TJ; Wen L; Feng QS,2023,"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)",306,12,3106-3119,10.1002/ar.25018,"Ji, S.

37158837,"HIV and AIDS prevention: knowledge, attitudes, practices and health literacy of older persons in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces, South Africa and in Lesotho.","BACKGROUND: Population ageing and access to anti-retroviral therapies in South Africa have resulted in ageing of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has implications for policy, planning and practice. Impactful interventions on HIV/AIDS for older persons require knowledge on effects of the pandemic on this population. A study was undertaken to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of HIV/AIDS, as well as health literacy (HL) level of a population aged ≥ 50 years.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at three sites in South Africa and two sites in Lesotho with an educational intervention at the South African sites. At baseline, data were collected for assessment of KAP of HIV/AIDS and HL levels. The pre- and post-intervention comprised participants at South African sites being familiarised with the contents of a specially constructed HIV/AIDS educational booklet. Participants' KAP was reassessed six weeks later. A composite score of ≥ 75% was considered adequate KAP and an adequate HL level.
RESULTS: The baseline survey comprised 1163 participants. The median age was 63 years (range 50-98 years); 70% were female, and 69% had ≤ 8 years' education. HL was inadequate in 56% and the KAP score was inadequate in 64%. A high KAP score was associated with female gender (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1), age < 65 years (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5-2.5) and education level (Primary school: AOR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.4-3.4); (High school: AOR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2.7-7.0); (University/college: AOR = 9.6; 95% CI = 4.7-19.7). HL was positively associated with education but no association with age or gender. The educational intervention comprised 614 (69%) participants. KAP scores increased post intervention: 65.2% of participants had adequate knowledge, versus 36% pre-intervention. Overall, younger age, being female and higher education level were associated with having adequate knowledge about HIV/AIDS, both pre- and post-intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The study population had low HL, and KAP scores regarding HIV/AIDS were poor but improved following an educational intervention. A tailored educational programme can place older people centrally in the fight against the epidemic, even in the presence of low HL. Policy and educational programmes are indicated to meet the information needs of older persons, which are commensurate with the low HL level of a large section of that population.",Kalula SZ; Blouws T; Ramathebane M; Sayed AR,2023,BMC geriatrics,23,1,279,10.1186/s12877-023-04009-7,"Kalula, S.

37832059,Inclusion of nutritional counseling and mental health services in HIV/AIDS management: A paradigm shift.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a public health challenge that can degenerate into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if not properly managed. HIV infection shortens life expectancy to about 5 to 10 years compared to noninfected individuals. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are prone to several health challenges as a result of a deranged immune system culminating in high morbidity and mortality. Depression is a common feature of PLWHA. Depression heightens the emergence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected individuals, accelerates the progression to AIDS, and increased suicidal tendencies, morbidity, and mortality. Food insecurity with its resultant undernutrition contributes to HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Undernourished PLWHA are more prone to opportunistic infections due to poor immunity. Interestingly, proper diet intake can boost immunity, slow the progression of AIDS and opportunistic infections, enhance body weight, and retard depression tendencies. Undernutrition can also be ameliorated by incorporating nutritional counseling and oral nutrient supplementation in routine HIV/AIDS checkups. Therefore, to increase HIV/AIDS management outcomes, the integration of nutrition counseling, dietary supplements, and mental health services should be embraced. Thus, HIV/AIDS care centers should amplify these services. In this article, we isolated relevant studies from various databases, illuminated the interwoven relationship between HIV/AIDS, depression, and undernutrition, and also reemphasized the need for adequate nutritional intervention in the battle against HIV/AIDS. Thus, this study provides a reawakening call to focus on incorporating nutritional guides and mental health care in HIV/AIDS management protocols.",Alum EU; Obeagu EI; Ugwu OPC; Samson AO; Adepoju AO; Amusa MO,2023,Medicine,102,41,e35673,10.1097/MD.0000000000035673,"Alum, E.

37079171,Progress of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries Towards Achieving the 95-95-95 UNAIDS Targets: A Review.,"BACKGROUND: In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and partners launched the 90-90-90 targets. These were further updated to correspond to 95-95-95 by the year 2025. We present an overview of the progress made by Gulf Cooperated Council (GCC) countries towards meeting the global targets.
METHODS: We extracted data from Global AIDS Monitoring (GAM), UNAIDS AIDS Info, HIV case reporting database, and the WHO global policy uptake for six countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab of Emirates (UAE) to assess the HIV/AIDS burden in the six GCC countries, and the progress towards achieving the 95-95-95 goal.
RESULTS: By the end of 2021, an estimated 42,015 people living with HIV (PLHIV) were residing in the GCC countries with prevalence levels below 0.01%. Data from four GCC countries, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and UAE, indicated that by 2021, 94%, 80%, 66%, and 85% of HIV-positive population knew their status, respectively. 68%, 93% (2020 data), 65%, 58% and 85% of PLHIV in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and UAE who knew their status were on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), respectively, and 55%, 92%, 58% and 90% (2020 data) among those who were on ART had viral suppression in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and KSA, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The GCC countries have made great strides toward fulfilling the 95-95-95 targets, but the interim 2025 overall UNAIDS targets remain unmet. The GCC countries must strive diligently to accomplish the targets by emphasising early identification of the cases by enhanced screening and testing, as well as prompt commencement of ART therapy with viral load suppression.",Awaidy SA; Ghazy RM; Mahomed O,2023,Journal of epidemiology and global health,13,3,397-406,10.1007/s44197-023-00097-1,"Awaidy, S.

34558397,Comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge and safer sex negotiation among adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Globally, HIV/AIDS remains a public health issue, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite the increased advocacy and dissemination of comprehensive HIV/AIDS information in SSA, it appears that little progress has been made to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the sub-region. This study, therefore, examined the association between comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge and safer sex negotiation among adolescent girls and young women in SSA. Data were taken from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2010 and 2019 in 30 countries in SSA. The study sample comprised 37,364 adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24. A multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was done to test the hypothesis that there is a positive association between comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge and safer sex negotiation. Adolescent girls and young women who had comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS were more likely to negotiate for safer sex compared with those who had no comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS (AOR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.22-1.41). At the country level, the positive association between comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS and safer sex negotiation was significant in Chad, Congo DR, Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Ethiopia and Malawi. On the other hand, in Togo, adolescent girls and young women who had comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge were less likely to negotiate for safer sex. These findings can inform policies and programmes on the crucial role of comprehensive HIV/AIDS education and knowledge in increasing safer sex negotiation among adolescent girls and young women in SSA. The study recommends that Togo needs to address certain practices such as intimate partner violence against adolescent girls and young women, which prevent them from negotiating for safer sex, despite their higher knowledge on comprehensive HIV/AIDS. Lessons can be learnt from Chad, Congo DR, Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Ethiopia and Malawi about the scale-up of programmes and interventions targeted at young women.",Frimpong JB; Budu E; Adu C; Mohammed A; Tetteh JK; Seidu AA; Ahinkorah BO,2022,Journal of biosocial science,54,6,991-1003,10.1017/S0021932021000493,"Frimpong, J.

Limited data exist on whether management practices in these countries affect patient outcomes. We assessed the real-world treatment approaches and outcomes of patients with KS in Peru. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related KS (AIDS-related KS; n = 95) and classic KS (CKS; n = 81) diagnosed at a tertiary center between 2000 and 2014 in Lima, Peru. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival (OS) rates. The median follow-up was 64 months for AIDS-related KS and 88 months for CKS. The median age of patients with AIDS-related KS was 35 years (range 20-63 years) and 70 years (range 33-91 years) for those with CKS. Most individuals had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≥ 2 (AIDS-related KS 75%; CKS 85%). Seventy-six percent and 40% of individuals with AIDS-related KS and CKS, respectively, received systemic chemotherapy. The most common first-line drug was paclitaxel, with relatively optimal overall response rates (ORRs) for AIDS-related KS (n = 64/72, 89%; ORR 61%) and CKS (n = 24/32, 75%; ORR 50%). The 5-year OS rates were 71% in the AIDS-related KS cohort and 81% in the CKS cohort.

35682181,"Voluntary Counseling and Testing, Antiretroviral Therapy Access, and HIV-Related Stigma: Global Progress and Challenges.","To date, about 37 million people are living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and an estimated 680,000 people have died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related illnesses globally. While all countries have been impacted by HIV, some have been significantly more impacted than others, particularly countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this paper was to identify progress made in HIV prevention globally, particularly in the areas of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) uptake, access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV-related stigma. With the development of ART, a cocktail of medications for the treatment of HIV, VCT uptake increased, as it became apparent that the medication would only be prescribed after an HIV diagnosis through testing. Widely considered a critical gateway to HIV prevention and treatment, VCT is being implemented in many countries, and as a result, about 38 million people living with HIV in 2018 had access to ART. Regardless of this success, major challenges still remain. We did an electronic search of 135 articles in English related to global HIV progress and challenges indexed in PubMed, ResearchGate, Google, and other search engines from 1998 to 2021. Sixty articles met the inclusion criteria for this paper. Data on trends in ART coverage were obtained from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) website. These data were used to show ART coverage globally in World Health Organization (WHO) regions. It was found that while global successes have been chalked in the areas of VCT uptake and ART coverage, HIV-related stigma has impeded greater success.

36283150,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in anti-CD20 and other monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies used in multiple sclerosis: A review.,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a subacute CNS inflammatory disease seen primarily among immunocompromised patients. It is caused by the JC virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that otherwise induces an insidious, latent infection in the general population. This reactivated disease is characterized by cognitive and behavioral changes, language disturbances, motor weakness, or visual deficits. Median survival in patients with AIDS is approximately 2-4 months, and mortality is high (around 4% in untreated AIDS). Recent scientific developments indicate that PML can also be associated with the increased utilization of monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapy. In fact, PML has been witnessed with several mAbs, including natalizumab in multiple sclerosis, rituximab for lymphoma or lupus, efalizumab for psoriasis, and ofatumumab in leukemia; this leads us to the risk reassessment of PML due to treatment-induced immunosuppression. The range of clinical presentations of JCV-related disease has transformed over time and can pose significant challenges to the current diagnostic criteria. Most cases with PML suffer from persistent and irreversible neurological conditions, and some with chronic, low-level viral replication in the CNS. With the expanded use of mAbs for various autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders, we are now seeing this infection in non-HIV patients on drugs such as natalizumab, rituximab, and other recently approved therapies. This article aims to review the relationship between the incidence of PML and all four mAbs used in the treatment of MS. Currently, at least 18 FDA-approved medications carry label warnings for PML;to this date, no treatment has been convincingly effective.",Sharma K; Tolaymat S; Yu H; Elkhooly M; Jaiswal S; Jena A; Kakara M; Sriwastava S,2022,Journal of the neurological sciences,443,,120459,10.1016/j.jns.2022.120459,"Sharma, K., Tolaymat, S., Yu, H., Elkhooly, M., Jaiswal, S., Jena, A., Kakara, M., & Sriwastava, S.

34880197,Clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS in China: Their potential benefits and impact on public health.,"Since the first edition of the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AIDS was published in 2005, the AIDS Specialists Group of the Society of Infectious Diseases has updated the guidelines three more times to include more thorough, practical, standardized, and specific content. The latest edition (the 2021 version) has recently been updated in China in accordance with clinical practice nationwide and results of the latest research. Compared to the four previous editions, the 2021 edition references the latest information on the epidemiology of HIV, the prevention of HIV transmission, standardized lab diagnosis, and clinical management. First, the guidelines highlight the concept of ""enhancing the combination of early intervention, prevention, and treatment"". The guidelines specify more detailed clinical phases (three clinical stages), the clinical staging and progression of AIDS, and patient prognosis. The guidelines also specify diagnostic criteria - HIV antibodies, HIV RNA tests, CD4 cell counts, and the patient's epidemiological history - to use in conjunction with symptoms to confirm an HIV infection. In addition, the guidelines summarize more advanced HIV/AIDS research in China by describing the different circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) in Chinese patients, by summarizing the most prevalent strains in the Chinese population, and by comparing disease progression by route of transmission and by the CD4+T cell count. Lastly, this edition describes ways to optimize programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission, strategies for diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections, the aging patient population, and specialized ART treatment programs for different populations living with HIV.

34264162,AIDS and COVID-19 in southern Africa.,"By the end of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, the numbers of cases and deaths in southern Africa were low in absolute and relative numbers. The BBC ran a story (which was later retracted) headlined ""Coronavirus in Africa: Could poverty explain mystery of low death rate?"". A heading in the New York Post said: ""Scientists can't explain puzzling lack of coronavirus outbreaks in Africa"". Journalist Karen Attiah concluded: ""It's almost as if they are disappointed that Africans aren't dying en masse and countries are not collapsing"". We wondered if the knowledge that southern African countries have acquired in their struggle against AIDS has contributed to a more effective approach against COVID-19. The viral origins of the diseases through zoonotic events are similar; neither has a cure, yet. In both diseases, behaviour change is an important prevention tool, and there are specific groups that are more vulnerable to infection. Equally, there are important differences: most people with COVID-19 will recover relatively quickly, while people living with HIV will need lifelong treatment. COVID-19 is extremely infectious, while HIV is less easily transmitted.",van Wyngaard A; Whiteside A,2021,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,20,2,117-124,10.2989/16085906.2021.1948877,"van Wyngaard, A., & Whiteside, A.

38065920,Translation of HIV/AIDS knowledge into behavior change among secondary school adolescents in Uganda: A review.,"The human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic is primarily affecting young people worldwide, with those between the ages of 15 and 24 accounting for nearly half of all new infections. This paper was written to effectively translate HIV/AIDS knowledge into actionable behavioral changes among secondary school students in Uganda by empowering them with comprehensive information, fostering a deeper understanding of preventive measures, and facilitating the development of responsible and informed decision-making skills, thereby reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS transmission within this demographic. There is a relationship between risk perception and behavior change in HIV/AIDS prevention among high school students. This can be explained by the high proportion of secondary school students who think they are at risk of HIV infection; this perception may be related to having had early sex, being sexually active, and knowing someone has died of HIV. High school students regularly engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms and having multiple lifelong partners. Student behavior is significantly influenced by HIV and AIDS prevention initiatives such as youth-friendly services, peer education, and condom use.",Obeagu EI; Obeagu GU; Ede MO; Odo EO; Buhari HA,2023,Medicine,102,49,e36599,10.1097/MD.0000000000036599,"Obeagu, E.

35606851,"Controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS: the role of social support, family functioning, self-efficacy and AIDS risk perception.","OBJECTIVES: We believe that major steps can be taken towards Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevention through identifying the relevant factors that are apt to predict risky behavior. The main purpose of the present study was to analyze and evaluate the relationship of social support, family functioning, self-efficacy and AIDS risk perception to controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS.
METHODS: To conduct this cross-sectional study, 765 subjects (59% female) were selected from the youth inhabiting the western provinces of Iran through cluster sampling. Five questionnaires were used: AIDS risk perception, self-efficacy in controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS, controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the family assessment device.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that all two models enjoyed acceptable fitness, and the mediating roles of self-efficacy and AIDS risk perception were confirmed. Moreover, family functioning and perceived social support together could predict 20% of the variance of controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS. The results also indicated that family functioning with a standardized coefficient of - 0.24 and self-efficacy in controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS with a standardized coefficient of 0.58 could predict the controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that self-efficacy and AIDS risk perception play major roles in controlling risky behavior associated with AIDS. Therefore, it is recommended that families and psychologists promote self-efficacy in order to prevent the occurrence of high-risk behaviors.",Zakiei A; Norouzi E; Ghasemi SR; Komasi S; Rostampour M; Khazaie H,2022,BMC psychology,10,1,132,10.1186/s40359-022-00839-z,"Zakiei, A., Norouzi, E., Ghasemi, S.

40261893,Epidemiological and spatial analysis of newly diagnosed HIV-1/AIDS patients before antiretroviral therapy in Ningxia from 2020 to 2021.,"The high mutability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the widespread use of antiretroviral drugs have rendered genetic diversity and pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) significant obstacles to the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the research on the epidemiological and spatial distribution characteristics of PDR in Ningxia is still insufficient. A cross-sectional study utilized pre-treatment blood samples collected between 2020 and 2021 from the biorepository in May 2024. Partial pol gene sequences were obtained through plasma collection and RNA extraction. Drug resistance analysis was performed using the Stanford University HIVdb algorithm. Molecular network were constructed using Cytoscape 3.10.0. Spatial analysis and visualization were further conducted using ArcGIS10.8.1. 95 sequences were obtained, among which 7 HIV-1 genotypes were detected and CRF07_BC (67.37%, 64/95) was the predominant one. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were detected in 13.68%(13/95) of the sequences. The risk of PDR occurrence was higher among individuals with CRF07_BC strain types. The 24 sequences of CRF07_BC, CRF01_AE, and URF subtypes grouped into nine transmission clusters in the molecular network, with CRF07_BC showing the highest integration and clustering rates. HIV-1 infections resistant to PDR were observed in all five cities in NHAR, accompanied by cross-city transmission. Additionally, seven imported sequences were detected, comprising CRF07_BC, CRF01_AE, and C subtypes, along with three sequences of CRF55_01B with high similarity to nonlocal sequences. From 2020 to 2021, the HIV-1 diversity increased significantly in NHAR, with the prevalence of PDR reaching moderate levels and evidence of resistance transmission. The districts and counties under the jurisdiction of Yinchuan City emerged as hotspots for both pre-treatment HIV/AIDS patients and the distribution of resistant strains. It is imperative to enhance PDR testing and implement targeted interventions in key areas to minimize the emergence and dissemination of resistant virus variants.",Liu Y; Ma X; Pei J; Yang D; Li Y; Zhu X; Wu Z,2025,PloS one,20,4,e0322389,10.1371/journal.pone.0322389,"Liu, Y., Ma, X., Pei, J., Yang, D., Li, Y., Zhu, X., & Wu, Z.

32030600,HIV/AIDS Among Female Sex Workers in China: Epidemiology and Recent Prevention Strategies.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to describe the epidemiology of HIV among female sex workers (FSWs) in China over the past decade, to summarize current gaps in knowledge regarding risk factors, and to identify new directions for HIV prevention strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: We summarized national and regional levels of HIV prevalence among FSWs based on reported rates in the literature from 2008 to 2018. Studies identified cases of HIV infection among FSWs in all but one province during this time period, and demonstrated a sporadic pattern in most provinces, with a low overall national HIV prevalence below 1%. However, in Yunnan and Guanxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions, the median-reported prevalence rates were close to or slightly above 1%. National prevention programs have widely promoted male condoms as a primary and practical measure for HIV prevention, but studies evaluating condom use practices among FSWs demonstrated wide variability. A rise in illicit use of synthetic drugs and changing sexual practices in the setting of sex work (e.g., anal sex) may represent newer risk factors for HIV transmission among FSWs; however, more data are needed to better characterize these trends. Limited studies have examined the feasibility and efficacy of innovative prevention tools (e.g., female condoms) or strategies (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) to prevent HIV among FSWs. We call for a more comprehensive understanding of current trends in HIV risk among FSWs, as well as more research focuses on innovative strategies to reduce the spread of HIV in this vulnerable population.",Zhang H; Hsieh E; Wang L; Liao S,2020,Current HIV/AIDS reports,17,2,151-160,10.1007/s11904-019-00477-y,"Zhang, H., Hsieh, E., Wang, L., & Liao, S.

He was born at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) in 1982. His mother was a sex worker who also injected drugs. He died at 31⁄2 years following multiple episodes of opportunistic infection and metastatic lymphoma. In the years between 1986 and 1990, 163 HIV-positive mothers gave birth at YNHH. The mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate was 20 percent. Women represented 8 percent of all HIV cases in the US compared with 29 percent in New Haven. We had a six times greater proportion of children living with HIV. The mean number of HIV-exposed babies rose annually from 26 (1985-87) to 37 (1988-90). Our first team of caregivers comprised a nurse practitioner, a social worker, and me. We were, in time, joined by a growing number of colleagues. Enlightened and generous hospital administrators provided us with outpatient space and the promise of continued funding to support additional staff and in 1987, an independent Pediatric AIDS Care Program. We implemented the proven MTCT prevention guidelines articulated in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocol 076 and by 1995, the MTCT rate at YNHH fell to 9 percent. Since 1996, the MTCT rate at YNHH has been zero percent. Combination antiretroviral therapy, cART, made its debut in the mid-1990s; five classes of drugs with multiple agents in each were licensed between 2003 and 2013. We designed individual treatment plans for each child and gradually entered an era when our clinic was populated with healthier long-term survivors.

37698802,Medical mistrust as a barrier to HIV prevention and care.,"Medical mistrust is fueled by conspiracy theories and histories of healthcare systems abuse and is a known determinant of health outcomes in minority populations. Plagued by multiple and pervasive conspiracy theories, HIV/AIDS has proven to be particularly hampered by medical mistrust. The current paper systematically reviews the literature on medical mistrust among people at risk for or living with HIV infection. The bulk of evidence from 17 studies supports medical mistrust as a barrier to HIV testing, engagement in prevention and care services, treatment uptake and adherence, and clinical outcomes. While findings mostly indicate that medical mistrust is a barrier to HIV prevention and care, some studies report null results and others suggest that medical mistrust may actually improve some HIV-related outcomes. Additionally, most of the reviewed literature was cross-sectional. Thus longitudinal, theory-driven research is needed to reconcile inconsistent findings and determine long term outcomes of medical mistrust. Interventions may then be developed to reduce the negative consequences associated with medical mistrust.",El-Krab R; Brousseau N; Kalichman SC,2023,Journal of behavioral medicine,46,6,897-911,10.1007/s10865-023-00417-7,"El-Krab, R., Brousseau, N., & Kalichman, S.

35443306,[Evaluation of China Comprehensive AIDS Response Program in 2020].,"Objective: To analyze the work indicators of China Comprehensive AIDS Response Program (China CARES) and provide reference for future work of the program. Methods: The scores of each indicator were calculated, and different scores among different types of program areas were compared. The M(Q1,Q3) was used to describe the score of each indicator. The entropy weight method was used to calculate the composite score of each indicator and the composite score was translated into a 100-point system and compared among indicators. Results: In terms of the first-level indicators, organizational leadership and management (96.0 points), publicity and education (94.0 points), and innovative strategies and measures (98.0 points) got relatively high scores; while comprehensive social governance of AIDS prevention (72.0 points) was with the lowest score. The scores of publicity and education and comprehensive intervention in county-level program areas were significantly lower than those in urban areas. For secondary indicators, the indicator with relatively lower scores included ""condom use among female sex workers last time"" (70.0 points)"", ""at least one local key population has an increase in the number of people receiving HIV testing compared with the previous year"" (70.0 points)"", ""colleges and occupational schools set up AIDS-related self-service facilities"" (65.0 points), ""HIV testing among the arrested people suspected of prostitution, adultery, drug users and traffickers"" (55.0 points) and ""condom use among men who have sex with men during last episode"" (50.0 points). The ""indicator 3 comprehensive intervention"" contributed most to the evaluation, while ""indicator 7 innovation strategies and measures"" played a minor role in the evaluation results. Conclusions: The overall situation of AIDS Response Program in 2020 was good, but the progress in different word areas was not yet balanced.

HIV/AIDS activism among Black women for Black women may be one solution to reduce the disparate rates of HIV/AIDS among Black women.

In this paper, I aim to identify mechanisms of empowerment for Black women to engage in HIV/AIDS activism. I draw upon empowerment theory as a theoretical framework to guide analysis of the literature and to offer a strengths-based perspective on Black women's efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. An extensive literature search was conducted to identify studies of Black women's participation in HIV/AIDS activism. The search yielded 11 studies that were included for review. Synthesis of the literature indicated the following analytic themes as mechanisms of empowerment for Black women to participate in HIV/AIDS activism: relationships and interactions with others, critical awareness, self-reflection, and spirituality. Article limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for social change are also discussed.

It argues that while previous research has focused on how HIV informs COVID-19, the reverse relationship has received insufficient attention. The authors propose a more comprehensive understanding of the issues, using insights from the sociology of memory. Experiences during COVID-19 not only reshape perceptions of HIV in the present but also transform how we remember the AIDS crisis of the past. We discuss the impact of these pandemics particularly for gay and bisexual men and their connected communities. Doing so underscores the co-construction of collective memories in the present, suggesting that COVID-19 has not only redefined our experience of HIV, but it has also reframed our understanding of the earlier AIDS crisis. We conclude by highlighting the potential for these transformations to be leveraged for empowerment, political action and change.

METHODS: All subjects with HIV enrolled in the ICONA cohort in 2009-2022 who started antiretroviral treatment (ART) within 4 months from diagnosis were included and divided into: (i) pre-ART CD4 count ≥350/mm3 without AIDS (non-LD), (ii) pre-ART CD4 count <350/mm3 without AIDS (LD asymptomatic), and (iii) with AIDS events pre-ART (LD-AIDS). The estimated probability and independent risk for mortality (all-cause and cause-specific) and treatment failure were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 6813 participants (2448 non-LD, 3198 LD asymptomatic, and 1167 LD-AIDS), 161 (2.4%) died after ART initiation. At survival analysis, a higher probability of all-cause mortality has been identified for LD than non-LD (P <0.001) and within the former, for LD-AIDS over LD asymptomatic (P <0.001). After adjusting for confounders, LD showed a higher risk of all-cause mortality (vs non-LD adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 5.51, P <0.001) and, in particular, being an AIDS presenter predicted a greater risk of all-cause (aHR = 4.42, P <0.001), AIDS-related (adjusted subhazard ratio [aSHR] = 16.86, P <0.001), and non-AIDS-related mortality (aSHR = 1.74, P = 0.022) than the rest of the late presenters. Among the short-term survivors in the LD-AIDS group, the long-term mortality was mediated by the lack of immune recovery at 2 years. Finally, LD compared with non-LD and, particularly, among the former, LD-AIDS over LD asymptomatic showed a greater risk of treatment failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, LD subjects, particularly, AIDS presenters, remained at a higher risk of poorer outcomes.

The main objective of the study is to minimize the number of HBV and HIV co-infected individuals in the community and the cost incurred to the effort applied towards protection and treatment control strategies. In this study, a novel HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection model has been formulated and analyzed to investigate the effects of protection and treatment control strategies on the spreading dynamics of the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection in the community. In the qualitative analyses we have computed all the models disease-free equilibrium points, all the models effective reproduction numbers and unique endemic equilibrium points, we have proved the two sub-models disease-free equilibrium points are locally as well as globally asymptotically stable whenever their associated effective reproduction numbers are less than one. In our understanding no one is formulated and analyzed the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection model with optimal control and cost-effective analyses so that we have formulated the associated optimal control problem and carried out the optimal control analysis on the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection model by implementing the Pontryagin's minimum principle. Numerical simulations with various combinations of the control efforts implemented are then carried out to investigate the impacts of protection and treatments to tackle the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection diseases spreading in the community. Finally, we also carried out cost-effectiveness analysis for the implemented control strategies. From the findings of the numerical simulations we observed that implementing all the proposed controlling strategies simultaneously has fundamental impact to minimize and control the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection spreading in the community but cost-effectiveness analysis proved that implemented strategy 4 (implemented the HIV protection and HBV treatment controls simultaneously) is the most cost-effective strategy as compared with all other implemented strategies and we recommend for the health stake holders and policy makers to implement this strategy to tackle the HBV and HIV/AIDS co-infection spreading problem in the community.",Teklu SW; Workie AH,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,4004,10.1038/s41598-024-83442-z,"Teklu, S.

36420290,The social capital effect on HIV/AIDS preventive efforts: a meta-analysis.,"HIV/AIDS is one of the sexually transmitted diseases that cause death worldwide. Its prevalence increases due to low prevention behaviour. The study aimed to estimate the effect of social capital on HIV/AIDS preventive efforts. This study was a meta-analysis and systematic analysis. We retrieved articles from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar from 2008-2021. The inclusion criteria were full-text articles with observational design and articles published in English. We focused on the problems of the PICO study, namely: population=men and women who were sexually active; intervention=high social capital; comparison=low social capital; outcome=HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. The articles were collected using the PRISMA flow diagram. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 with a random effect model. The study included 12 articles. The likelihood of sexually active men and women with high social capital to perform HIV/AIDS prevention efforts was 1.55 times higher than those with low social capital (aOR=1.55; CI 95%=1.11 to 2.16; p=0.009).",Nugraheni R; Murti B; Irawanto ME; Sulaiman ES; Pamungkasari EP,2022,Journal of medicine and life,15,10,1212-1217,10.25122/jml-2021-0348,"Nugraheni, R., Murti, B., Irawanto, M.

In 1994, Chang and Moore discovered Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus for the first time in KS lesions in AIDS patients. KS is a low-grade mesenchymal neoplasm of blood and lymphatic vessels that primarily affects the skin, although the disease may become disseminated to the lymphatic system, lungs, airways, or abdominal viscera. In this research, clinical characteristics and treatment of patients of Kaposi sarcoma were retrospectively analyzed in Hotan District, Xinjiang China. We look into the clinical traits, prognosis, and therapy of Kaposi sarcoma. From May 2017 to August 2022, 32 patients were treated in the People's Hospital of Hotan District, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Twenty-two of these were classic Kaposi sarcomas (cKS), and 10 of these were Kaposi sarcomas linked to AIDS (AIDS-KS). The majority of KS patients were Uyghur. In terms of age at onset, AIDS-KS patients were younger than cKS patients. cKS and AIDS-KS are most frequently manifested in the feet and lower limbs. Ten patients with AIDS-KS have treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (combination antiretroviral therapy) combination chemotherapy, 5 of 10 patients had a complete response, 2 patients achieved partial response, the overall effective rate was 70%, and CD4 + T cells were greater than before. For cKS and AIDS-KS, the median overall survival was 56 and 50.8 months, respectively (P > .05).

This article studies phase one of the project, undertaken from 1987 through 1991, to trace how the Coalition educated the disability community about HIV/AIDS, advocated for HIV/AIDS to be recognized as a disability, and pushed for cooperation between the HIV/AIDS and disability movements. Accordingly, it analyzes the research reports, educational materials, and conference presentations produced by and for the Coalition during this time. A critical evaluation of these materials demonstrates how the gay rights and disability rights movements were repeatedly juxtaposed to uncover strategies that could benefit HIV/AIDS activism, which inadvertently overlooked barriers that prevented the communities from cooperating. By contextualizing the efforts of the Coalition, however, this article highlights how they identified and challenged barriers that inhibited members of both communities from accessing services and support systems needed to fully integrate and participate in society.",McLaughlin MJ,2025,Canadian journal of health history = Revue canadienne d'histoire de la sante,42,1,182-211,10.3138/cjhh.674-092023,"McLaughlin, M.

Very recently, Dash et al have for the first time reached the functional cure in HIV-infected humanized mice using CRISPR-Cas9 in combination with LASER ART, and this with a success of one third. Here, I use a theoretical approach to design a therapeutic strategy applicable to humans and different from that of Dash et al. The experimental treatment presented here includes the injection of an Env-directed integrase-defective CRISPR gene-editing lentiviral vector able to express quintuplex gRNAs plus the humanized SpCas9 and the puromycin resistance gene linked by T2A, preceded by a plasma/leukapheresis and the injection of an immunosuppressive cocktail, and followed by an in vivo positive selection.

The aim of this study was to evaluate HIV/AIDS knowledge among Iranian HCWs.
METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 HCWs who were randomly selected from health care centers in Kermanshah city, west of Iran, 2018. HCWs filled out a self-administered questionnaire including the socio-demographic characteristics and HIV/AIDS knowledge items. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 using bivariate correlations, t-test, and ANOVA statistical tests.
RESULTS: The mean score of HIV/AIDS knowledge was 29.73 [95% CI: 28.79, 30.67], ranged from 0 to 40 (74.3% of total percent). There was no significant association and correlation between HIV/AIDS knowledge and sex, education level, marital status, age and job history. Up to 50% had inadequate knowledge about HIV/AIDS status and transmission in Iran.

35285594,Schoolteachers for Action Against HIV/AIDS-related Oral Disease of Children in Africa.,"PURPOSE: The intention of the study was to evaluate whether Sub-Saharan schoolteachers may play a key role in oral health promotion of primary schoolchildren, particularly in terms of prevention of HIV/AIDS-related oral health problems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study examined the level of knowledge about oral disease and the prevention of HIV/AIDS oral lesions amongst schoolteachers of Tanzania and Burkina Faso, identified their sources of information, and evaluated their ability for HIV/AIDS intervention. A multi-centre cross-sectional study was implemented in the two Sub-Saharan African countries. Participants comprised primary school teachers selected by stratified cluster sampling: 261 teachers from Tanzania and 313 teachers from Burkina Faso. All participants completed a structured questionnaire prepared for self-administration. The questions were designed from a standardised questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization.
RESULTS: Most teachers knew about the principal causes of the major oral diseases and the means of disease prevention. Nearly all teachers (95.6%) were aware of HIV/AIDS and they knew (92.3%) a virus was the direct cause of AIDS. Teachers were well informed of the general symptoms of HIV/AIDS, although oral symptoms were mentioned less often. In all, 17.6% of schoolteachers reported that children suffering from HIV/AIDS were found in their classes and 10.3% of teachers were conscious of students receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Knowledge about the disease seemed to reflect mass media as a source, while teacher colleagues and health personnel played a somewhat lesser role in communication. In total, 83.2% emphasised that they should teach children about HIV/AIDS and the mouth. Schoolteachers from Tanzania (70.5%) were more often engaged in classroom-based oral health education than were the Burkinabe teachers (53.9%).
CONCLUSION: The study confirms that schoolteachers may be a relevant source in the fight against HIV/AIDS among children. However, they would benefit from interaction with health personnel.",Petersen PE; Kahabuka F; Ouattara S,2022,Oral health & preventive dentistry,20,,69-76,10.3290/j.ohpd.b2805333,"Petersen, P.

The proportion of those over 50 is around 30% and it has now become more likely that an older HIV-positive patient with other pre-existing illnesses will have to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) for a reason not directly associated with HIV than a person with a new HIV diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nevertheless, one third of patients with a new HIV diagnosis already have an advanced immune deficiency. Neurological or respiratory symptoms that require intensive medical care must be expected in these patients. The present article aims to raise awareness of these clinical pictures and the necessary differential diagnostics, and to provide the reader with an overview of the most important opportunistic infections and their treatment.

40310879,"Sex-disaggregated data along the gendered health pathways: A review and analysis of global data on hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and AIDS.","BACKGROUND: Health data disaggregated by sex is vital for identifying the distribution of illness, and assessing risk exposures, service access, and utilization. Disaggregating data along a health pathway, i.e., the measurable continuum from risk factor exposure to final health outcome (death), and including disease prevalence and a three-step care cascade (diagnosis, treatment, and control), has the potential to provide a holistic and systematic source of information on sex- and gender-based health inequities and identify opportunities for more tailored interventions to reduce those inequities.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected sex- and age-disaggregated data along the health pathway. We searched for papers using global datasets on the sex-disaggregated care cascade for eight major conditions and identified cascade data for only three conditions: hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS. For each condition, we collected risk factor prevalence, disease prevalence, cascade progression, and death rates. We assessed the sex difference for all steps along the pathway and interpreted inequities through a lens of gender analysis. Sex-disaggregated data on risk factors, disease prevalence, and mortality were found for all three conditions across 204 countries. Sex-disaggregated care cascades for hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS were found only for 200, 39, and 76 countries, respectively. Significant sex differences were found in each step along the pathways. In many countries, males exhibited higher disease prevalence and death rates than females, while in some countries, they also reported lower rates of healthcare seeking, diagnosis, and treatment adherence. Smoking prevalence was higher among males in most countries, whereas prevalence of obesity and unsafe sex were higher in females in most countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the increasing need to develop strategies that encourage greater male participation in preventive and healthcare service and underscore the importance of sex-disaggregated data in understanding health inequities and guiding gender-responsive interventions at different points along the pathway. Despite limitations in data availability and completeness, this study elucidates the need for more comprehensive and harmonized datasets for these and other conditions to monitor sex differences and implement sex-/gender-responsive interventions along the health pathway.",Feraldi A; Zarulli V; Buse K; Hawkes S; Chang AY,2025,PLoS medicine,22,5,e1004592,10.1371/journal.pmed.1004592,"Feraldi, A., Zarulli, V., Buse, K., Hawkes, S., & Chang, A.

32720253,Social Network Interventions for HIV Transmission Elimination.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Network interventions for HIV prevention represent a potential area for growth in a globalizing world, where persons are more easily connected to one another through social media and networking applications. The basic tenets of network interventions such as (1) selection of a change agent, (2) segmentation, (3) induction, and (4) alteration represent myriad ways to structure network interventions for HIV prevention with the potential for large public health impact.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have employed the use of social networking websites such as Facebook to identify key persons to recruit others and disseminate information aimed at decreasing HIV transmission and improving safe sex practices among groups who are more vulnerable to HIV acquisition. Many of these interventions have successfully decreased HIV risk behaviors as well as decreased the spread of HIV among intervention cohorts. Network interventions for HIV prevention provide more opportunities to reach populations who have not been reached through typical efforts employed in clinical and public health settings, though they are not currently widely employed by the public health community and other stakeholders.",Pagkas-Bather J; Young LE; Chen YT; Schneider JA,2020,Current HIV/AIDS reports,17,5,450-457,10.1007/s11904-020-00524-z,"Pagkas-Bather, J., Young, L.

METHODS: Data on women diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in New Zealand (1996-2020) were collected through routine surveillance case reports from healthcare providers. CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3 was considered a late diagnosis. Women living with HIV by 31 December 2020 included those first diagnosed in New Zealand and those previously diagnosed overseas.
RESULTS: A total of 634 women have been diagnosed with HIV (18% of all diagnoses in this time): most cases were acquired through heterosexual contact (82%). Twenty-eight percent (n=180/634) acquired HIV in New Zealand, of whom 43% were diagnosed late. AIDS was diagnosed in 128 women (72% within three months of HIV diagnosis). An estimated 570 women (77% aged >40 years) were living with diagnosed HIV at the end of 2020.

39477558,"Ending AIDS as a public health threat: the imperative for clear messaging on U=U, viral suppression, and zero risk.","To end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, we must leverage both the impactful message of U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable) and viral suppression to improve the wellbeing of individuals living with HIV, increase engagement with HIV services, and reduce barriers such as stigma, discrimination, and criminalisation. This message requires clear and unambiguous evidence-based narratives that emphasise the message that there is zero risk of sexual transmission when an undetectable viral load is maintained and negligible risk when viral suppression (as defined by 200-1000 copies per mL) is maintained. Dissemination of this information to individuals living with or affected by HIV, health-care workers, communities, the general public, and policy makers will increase awareness and credibility of this message and challenge deep-seated misperceptions. Furthermore, understanding the impact of this evidence underscores the necessity to urgently prioritise universal access to quality care, including viral load testing; leverage community leadership to address structural barriers; and monitor for ongoing success.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Global Health, SCOPUS, Medline and EMBASE using pertinent key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms relating to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. Articles are summarized in relevant sections.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five articles were identified after duplicates had been removed. After screening, eight studies were analysed, totalling 70 HIV-infected patients (57 without AIDS and 13 with AIDS). Three themes were identified: (1) controlled HIV infection does not appear to result in poorer COVID-19 outcomes, (2) more data are needed to determine COVID-19 outcomes in patients with AIDS and (3) HIV-infected patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms should be investigated for superinfections.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PLHIV with well-controlled disease are not at risk of poorer COVID-19 disease outcomes than the general population. It is not clear whether those with poorly controlled HIV disease and AIDS have poorer outcomes. Superimposed bacterial pneumonia may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 but further research is urgently needed to elucidate whether PLHIV are more at risk than the general population.",Cooper TJ; Woodward BL; Alom S; Harky A,2020,HIV medicine,21,9,567-577,10.1111/hiv.12911,"Cooper, T.

Then, the experts judged these components and 13 defining characteristics were validated using the binominal test with adequacy ratio above 85% and p value <0.05. After this stage, the conceptual and operational definitions of these defining characteristics were constructed, validating them by the content validation index ≥0.80 by the expert nurses.
CONCLUSIONS: Three new defining characteristics for Ineffective health self-management were proposed and validated by specialists. Conceptual and operational definitions of the new and current defining characteristics were elaborated and validated for people living with HIV/AIDS.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The knowledge and study of the conceptual and operational definitions of nursing diagnoses can contribute to good nursing practices, assisting in the care and evaluation of nurses in the provision of care to people living with HIV/AIDS, and can avoid misunderstandings and inappropriate interpretations and can guarantee assertive clinical judgment.

35666083,Obesity: A comorbidity-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (CAIDS).,"Accumulating data emphasize a strong link between obesity and the severity of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), including mortality. Obesity interferes with several components of the immune system including lymphoid tissue's integrity, leukocytes' development and function, complement system's activation, and the coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses. Overall, obesity results in a less efficient immune response to infectious agents. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exploits this weakened immune system in people with obesity to precipitate COVID-19, and in some cases death. It is therefore the author's recommendation that obesity should be viewed as another form of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and be treated with the appropriate seriousness. Unlike the previously described acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), obesity is a comorbidity-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. People with AIDS do not die from HIV, but may die from opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, AIDS is ascribed its due importance in the course of deterioration of the patient. Similarly, obesity should be acknowledged further as a risk factor for mortality from COVID-19. Obesity is a modifiable condition and even in people with a strong genetic predisposition, lifestyle modifications can reverse obesity, and even moderate weight loss can improve the inflammatory milieu. Strong public health actions are warranted to promote lifestyle measures to reduce the burden from overweight and obesity that currently affect more than one-third of the global population, with projections alarming this may reach 55-80% within the next thirty years.",Siopis G,2023,International reviews of immunology,42,6,415-429,10.1080/08830185.2022.2083614,"Siopis, G.

34635019,"Catch them young: Knowledge and awareness levels of HIV and AIDS transmission among high school students in Harare, Zimbabwe.","HIV and AIDS has developed as one of the urgent problems affecting many youths in Africa. Yet many of the knowledge and awareness programmes aimed at young people do not target high schools where the majority of young people are found. As a result, many youths do not have accurate information on HIV and AIDS that they can use to protect themselves from the disease. The objectives of this study were to determine the knowledge and awareness of Sixth Form students regarding the spread of HIV and AIDS among young people. A study was carried out among Sixth Form students in three schools in Harare from October 2017 to November 2017. A total of 156 students participated in the survey. Results showed that most students (74%) obtained their information on HIV and AIDS from television and radio programmes. Most students (92%) were able to identify unprotected sexual intercourse as the major mode of HIV transmission, while 89% said that HIV could be transmitted through sharing injections. Some students had misconceptions about HIV and AIDS which might negatively influence their behaviour and attitude towards HIV and AIDS, for example, 11% of students said HIV and AIDS could be cured. The study concludes that programmes on awareness and knowledge application in schools are limited, and efforts should be increased to help students effectively apply the knowledge they have about HIV and AIDS in everyday life situations, and protect themselves from the disease.",Choruma DJ; Choruma SD; Pasirayi RM,2021,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,20,3,224-231,10.2989/16085906.2021.1979060,"Choruma, D.

39074082,Magnitude of consistent condom use and associated factors among people living with HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia: Implication for reducing infections and re-infection. A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The human immune virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a major threat to the health of millions of people worldwide. In Ethiopia, there were more than a million people living with HIV/AIDS. The continuous and appropriate use of condoms, particularly among those who have HIV-positive clients, is essential to a comprehensive and long-term approach to avoiding HIV and other STIs as well as unintended pregnancy. But irregular condom use is regularly reported. There is inconsistent reports of the prevalence and correlates of frequent condom use in Ethiopia. This study's goal is to provide an overview of the most recent research on magnitude condom use among people living with HIV in Ethiopia.
METHODS: Four databases of PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used. Finally, 10 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The data were collected using a methodical checklist for data extraction, and STATA 14 was utilized for the analysis. The consistent condom use was reported as use of condom in every sexual encounter preceding the study. The prevalence of consistent condom usage among HIV/AIDS patients was calculated by dividing the total number of patients who regularly used condoms by the total number of HIV/AIDS patients and multiplying that result by 100. The factors associated with a consistent use of condom were described using the pooled odds ratio (OR) and calculated based on binary outcomes from the included primary studies. The statistical significance was determined based on the correlation factor as their confidence level should not include 1. Subgroup analyses by region and publication years were carried out by using a random-effects model. The STATA commands of metan magnitude semagnitude, random xlab(.1,5,10) lcols (authors) by (variables)texts(120) xsize(18) ysize (14) were used to carried out the subgroup analysis. To assess the presence of publication bias, funnel plot, Egger test and Begg's test at 5% significant level were computed. The asymmetry of funnel plot and the Egger test and Begg's test P value of 0 >0.5 showed the absence of publication bias. The Cochrane Q test statistic and I2 tests were used to assess heterogeneity.
RESULT: The pooled magnitude of consistent condom use was 50.56% (95%CI: 38.09-63.02). The predictors of consistent condom use includes urban residence (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI: 2.24-5.35), marital status (AOR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.61), and HIV disclosure status (AOR = 5.61;95%CI: 2.29-13.73).
CONCLUSION: Half of the HIV/AIDS patients in our study regularly used condoms. According to this study, urban residency, disclosure status, and marital status were all associated with consistent condom use among HIV/AIDS patients. Therefore, health education about condom use should be provided to married couples and people living in rural regions. In addition, disclosing HIV status and the necessity of constant condom usage would be crucial for consistent condom use.",Bekele F; Tafese L; Debushe T,2024,PloS one,19,7,e0304248,10.1371/journal.pone.0304248,"Bekele, F., Tafese, L., & Debushe, T.

37853487,Modified sharp regression discontinuity model to settings with fuzzy variables.,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to develop a Modified Sharp Regression Discontinuity model to predict alcohol consumption in People Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Previous studies focused on either fuzzy dependent or fuzzy independent variables separately. However, there is a gap in research that examines the interaction between both types of fuzzy variables thus the model considers both dependent and independent fuzzy variables.
METHODS: A statistical model was developed to predict the relationship between alcohol consumption and HIV progression. The model equations are solved numerically using parametric estimation.
RESULTS: In simulation studies, as the sample size expanded, the estimates derived from the modified sharp regression discontinuity model exhibited probabilistic convergence towards the true value, thereby validating the estimator of the Average Causal Effect's consistency. Counseling has an average causal effect in the sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) for compliers that is roughly equal to 0.199. This was the variation in Alcohol Use Detective Identification Test (AUDIT) threshold scores or the change in intercept scores when counseling was effective. Following six months of participation in the counseling program, AUDIT scores decreased, leading to an increase in Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts and a decrease in viral loads.
CONCLUSION: The Modified Sharp RDD offers a robust approach to handle fuzzy variables in causal inference. Our study contributes to the advancement of RDD methodology and its applicability in real-world settings with uncertain data.",Mafukidze PK; Mwalili SM; Mageto T,2023,BMC research notes,16,1,278,10.1186/s13104-023-06561-2,"Mafukidze, P.

36650805,Modelling Botswana's HIV/AIDS response and treatment policy changes: Insights from a cascade of mathematical models.,"The management of HIV/AIDS has evolved ever since advent of the disease in the past three decades. Many countries have had to revise their policies as new information on the virus, and its transmission dynamics emerged. In this paper, we track the changes in Botswana's HIV/AIDS response and treatment policies using a piece-wise system of differential equations. The policy changes are easily tracked in three epochs. Models for each era are formulated from a ""grand model"" that can be linked to all the epochs. The grand model's steady states are determined and analysed in terms of the model reproduction number, $ R_{0}. $ The model exhibits a backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium when $ R_{0} < 1. $ The stability of the models for the other epochs can be derived from that of the grand model by setting some parameters to zero. The models are fitted to HIV/AIDS prevalence data from Botswana for the past three decades. The changes in the populations in each compartment are tracked as the response to the disease and treatment policy changed over time. Finally, projections are made to determine the possible trajectory of HIV/AIDS in Botswana. The implications of the policy changes are easily seen, and a discussion on how these changes impacted the epidemic are articulated. The results presented have crucial impact on how policy changes affected and continue to influence the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Botswana.",Kaisara T; Nyabadza F,2023,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,20,1,1122-1147,10.3934/mbe.2023052,"Kaisara, T., & Nyabadza, F.

33410278,Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and late presentation in Poland - data from Test and Keep in Care (TAK) Polska project.,"OBJECTIVES: Late presentation (LP) at HIV diagnosis is associated with worse prognosis and an increase in the number of new infections. We analyse the proportion of patients diagnosed late and factors related to LP in Poland in 2016-2017.
METHODS: Data were obtained from 13 out of 17 HIV centres in Poland from 2016 and 2017, including date of diagnosis, age, sex, transmission route, anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory (VDRL) antibodies, AIDS diagnosis, baseline HIV viral load and CD4 count.
RESULTS: Out of 1522 patients, 88.9% were male with median age of 33.6 years. Men who have sex with men (MSM) comprised 69.4% of all new infections, heterosexual route of transmission (HTX) 18.2% and injecting drug use (IDU) 4.7%. Late presenters comprised 44.8% of the study group. Factors associated with LP were female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.09-2.08], older age (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.42-1.79 per decade), route of transmission (HTX: OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.50-2.56; IDU: OR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.92-5.37), positive HCV results (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.23-2.95) and syphilis diagnosis (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 2.29-3.31). Adjusting for these factors, the only independent factors associated with LP were age (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.35-1.71) and route of transmission (HTX: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.23-2.44; IDU: OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.25-4.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Late presentation in Poland follows European trends. A total of 44.8% of all newly diagnosed patients in Poland continue to present late or at the AIDS stage. Independent factors associated with LP/AIDS were older age, IDU and HTX.

37975219,"KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE OF PREMARITAL SCREENING FOR HIV/AIDS AMONG RESIDENCE OF RURAL AREAS IN NORTH-EASTERN NIGERIA.","INTRODUCTION: One of the biggest health challenges threatening the human race in recent times is the HIV/AIDS pandemic. To know one's HIV status is a part of the human right to health. The disease has continued to be on the front burner for many years now, despite initial denials and cover-ups by some countries. Sub-Saharan Africa with just over 10 percent of the world's population has the greatest burden of this disease. It is estimated that close to two-thirds of all people living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa with South Africa having the highest number.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of premarital screening of HIV/AIDS among residents of rural areas of Itas Gadau local government area of Bauchi state, North-eastern Nigeria.
METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used for the study. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 379 eligible respondents comprising residents of Itas and Gadau towns of Bauchi State. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select the participants for the study. Pearson's chi-square test was used in testing for the association between educational status and premarital screening for HIV/AIDS in rural areas. Results: The results show that all (100%) of the respondents have heard of HIV/AIDS and the dominant source of information was from friends (77.6%) followed by healthcare workers (17.4%). In addition, 90% of participants have good knowledge of premarital screening for HIV/AIDS. Majority of the study respondents had undergone premarital screening for HIV/AIDS (64.4%). The result also shows that there is a statistically significant relationship between educational status and the practice of premarital screening for HIV/AIDS in Itas/Gadau, Bauchi State with p-value of 0.001.
CONCLUSION: The study found that there was a very high level of knowledge, good attitude, and practice for HIV/AIDS among the study respondents. Thus we recommend that the community should maintain the mandatory premarital screening and continue with regular health education on premarital screening for HIV/AIDS.",Maigoro AM; Usman US; Abdullahi AI; Salisu RB; Maje SS; Mohammed S; Mele UA,2023,West African journal of medicine,40,11 Suppl 1,S12,,"Maigoro, A.

38381726,The level of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among orphan children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Many children and adolescents living with HIV have ended up as orphans. Due to HIV taking away their parents leaves them deprived of their most important social network and support, which predisposes them to poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Various studies have shown poor adherence to ART among orphaned children and adolescents. This systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, aims to determine the level of ART adherence among orphaned children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: This PROSPERO registered review (CRD42022352867) included studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Africa Journal Online, and selected HIV/AIDS journals from data inception to June 01, 2022. We included articles published in all languages that report the prevalence of adherence to ART among children and adolescent orphans (single parent orphans and/or double orphans) living with HIV/AIDS. We excluded qualitative studies, case studies, opinion papers, and letters to editors. We used the random-effect model to calculate the pooled prevalence of ART adherence based on the highest prevalence provided by the various methods in a particular study. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute Appraisal tool for the prevalence study to evaluate for risk of bias in the included studies. The Egger's test was used to assess small study effects.
RESULTS: Out of 1087 publications identified from the various databases, six met the selection criteria. The included six studies had a total 2013 orphans living with HIV/AIDS. The pooled prevalence of ART adherence was 78∙0% (95% Confidence Interval: 67.4-87.7; I2 = 82.92%, p<0∙001) and ranged between 7∙6% and >95%, using one of the following methods: pill count, caregiver's self-report, clinical attendance, and nevirapine plasma levels (above three μg/mL). The factors associated with adherence were pill burden, caregiver involvement, stunting, and caregiver relationship.
LIMITATION: There was a high level of heterogeneity in the finding.
CONCLUSION: Approximately four fifth of orphan children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS adhere to ART. Strategies to improve adherence among this group should be prioritized, especially among the double orphaned children and adolescents.",Kamau SG; Akatusasira R; Namatovu A; Kibet E; Ssekitto JM; Mamun MA; Kaggwa MM,2024,PloS one,19,2,e0295227,10.1371/journal.pone.0295227,"Kamau, S.

Based on the comprehensive task-based adaptation model, this study aims to explore the process and experience of adapting to living with HIV among HIV/AIDS patients and to provide evidence for promoting the adaptation of this population.
METHODS: With the design of the phenomenon study, we purposefully recruited 43 HIV/AIDS patients and conducted semi-structural interviews. The qualitative data was analyzed by Van Manen method.
RESULTS: There were 1 307 significant quotes and 6 themes with 14 sub-themes. ""The shadow comes along with the sunshine"" was proposed to describe the process of adapting to life with HIV. Another 5 themes emerged to represent the tasks as follows: the direction of the mental anchor, the management of physical tasks, social network and support, the occupational dilemma and benefits, and the consideration of the future.

The study examines the qualitative outcomes and confirms the local and global asymptotic stability of both the endemic equilibrium and the disease-free equilibrium. The model's criteria for exhibiting both local and global asymptotically stable behavior are examined. We compute the endemic equilibria and obtain the existence of a unique positive endemic equilibrium. The data is fitted to the model using the idea of nonlinear least-squares fitting. Accurate parameter values are achieved by fitting the data to the model using a 95% confidence interval. The basic reproduction number is computed using parameters that have been fitted or estimated.

38557932,Editorial: Forty Years of Waiting for Prevention and Cure of HIV Infection - Ongoing Challenges and Hopes for Vaccine Development and Overcoming Antiretroviral Drug Resistance.,"In April 1984, 40 years ago, the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that Dr. Robert Gallo and his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) had confirmed the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a retrovirus, which became known as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1986. For the past 40 years, prevention and cure of HIV infection have been the dual 'holy grail' sought but still not achieved. By the beginning of 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in the past 40 years, between 65.0 million and 113.0 million people have been infected with HIV, and between 32.9 million and 51.3 million people have died from HIV infection. On 29 February 2024, the WHO published an updated report in response to increasing reports of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). Currently, HIV vaccines in development are in early-stage clinical trials.

33467074,The Impact of HIV- and ART-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cellular Senescence and Aging.,"According to the WHO, 38 million individuals were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 25.4 million of which were using antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2019. Despite ART-mediated suppression of viral replication, ART is not a cure and is associated with viral persistence, residual inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. Indeed, due to the presence of viral reservoirs, lifelong ART therapy is required to control viremia and prevent disease progression into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Successful ART treatment allows people living with HIV (PLHIV) to achieve a similar life expectancy to uninfected individuals. However, recent studies have illustrated the presence of increased comorbidities, such as accelerated, premature immune aging, in ART-controlled PLHIV compared to uninfected individuals. Studies suggest that both HIV-infection and ART-treatment lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in cellular exhaustion, senescence, and apoptosis. Since mitochondria are essential cellular organelles for energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism, their compromise leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and beta-oxidation, abnormal cell homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations and cellular apoptosis. The progressive mitochondrial damage induced by HIV-infection and ART-treatment likely contributes to accelerated aging, senescence, and cellular dysfunction in PLHIV. This review discusses the connections between mitochondrial compromise and cellular dysfunction associated with HIV- and ART-induced toxicities, providing new insights into how HIV and current ART directly impact mitochondrial functions and contribute to cellular senescence and aging in PLHIV. Identifying this nexus and potential mechanisms may be beneficial in developing improved therapeutics for treating PLHIV.",Schank M; Zhao J; Moorman JP; Yao ZQ,2021,Cells,10,1,,10.3390/cells10010174,"Schank, M., Zhao, J., Moorman, J.

39257065,Strategic investment and program effectiveness: a roadmap to ending AIDS in Bangladesh by 2030.,"The journey towards ending AIDS epidemic in Bangladesh by 2030 is ambitious yet achievable. Although Bangladesh has always had a low rate of HIV among its general population, it remains one of seven countries in Asia and the Pacific where new HIV cases are rising. This study evaluates the effectiveness of HIV programmatic strategies and investment scenarios using the AIDS Epidemic Model (AEM) from 2023 to 2030, focusing on optimizing resource allocation and interventions. The findings indicate that without improved program effectiveness, new HIV infections will increase to 1,382 by 2030, failing to meet the targets of the Global AIDS Strategy 2021-2026. If Bangladesh improves its HIV program effectiveness according to the Global AIDS Strategy 2021-2026, the NSP and Global AIDS Strategy targets could significantly lower new infections and AIDS-related deaths and increase treatment coverage to meet Ending AIDS targets. The NSP targets could reduce new HIV infections to under 275 annually and achieve treatment goals by 2030. The study reveals that NSP targets are the most cost-effective, offering the highest benefit-cost ratio, highlighting the urgent need to enhance HIV prevention program effectiveness, particularly among key populations, to achieve both public health and economic benefits.",Huq MN; Khan S; Yasmin S; Hossain MM,2024,AIDS care,36,11,1690-1703,10.1080/09540121.2024.2397132,"Huq, M.

39609662,Evaluating compliance with quality indicators of HIV and AIDS clinical care and analyzing those associated with mortality in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"BACKGROUND: Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection have been identified, significant improvements have been made concerning its diagnosis and treatment. Few contributions have been made in the area of quality indicators in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). To address this gap, a recent study conducted in the said area in 2023 resulted in the development of a comprehensive list of 88 indicators for assessing the quality of clinical care for HIV and AIDS. Out of these, 66 were identified as a core set of quality indicators for the assessment of HIV and AIDS clinical care. The aim of this study was to evaluate compliance with these quality indicators and determine those that are associated with mortality among people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) in the DRC.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, South Kivu province of the DRC. The study population included PLWHA adult patients who were followed for a period of five years at the antiretroviral (ARV) clinic from January 2017 to December 2021. Descriptive analysis was performed to evaluate essential characteristics, and inferential statistics were performed including a multivariable logistic regression analysis performed to assess the association between selected clinical care indicators and PLWHA mortality, to estimate the odds ratios of mortality based on various factors, and to control for confounding variables.
RESULTS: A total of 884 PLWHA were included. The level of compliance with the quality indicators was 78.79%. In the multivariate analysis, the quality-of-care indicators associated with mortality in the follow-up PLWHA on treatment were items 12 (Late diagnosis of HIV infection in specialized care), 24 (Assessment of resistance in cases of virologic failure), and 38 (Evaluation of Cardiac risk). Other factors associated with mortality were male sex, lower CD4 (< 500mm3) and high viral load (> 50 copies/ml).
CONCLUSION: The level of compliance with the indicators was moderate. Some quality indicators were associated with mortality. These indicators are associated with delayed diagnosis of HIV infection, assessment of resistances in case of virologic failure, and evaluation of cardiac risk. Addressing gaps in adherence to these quality of care indicators (clinical care standards) could potentially reduce mortality rates and enhance the overall management of HIV and AIDS, particularly at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, South Kivu Province, and in general in the DRC.",Muzumbukilwa TW; Dieudonne BM; Manimani RG; Mushebenge AG; Vagiri RV; Nlooto M,2024,BMC infectious diseases,24,1,1359,10.1186/s12879-024-10253-y,"Muzumbukilwa, T.

35664113,"Structural Equation Model Analysis of HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Attitude, and Sex Education Among Freshmen in Jiangsu, China.","BACKGROUND: The study of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related knowledge, attitude, and sex education status of Jiangsu freshmen was conducted, which can provide data support directionally for the prevention work of HIV/AIDS among this population.
METHODS: Male students (4,006) and female students (4,279) were selected from 20 universities or colleges in the Jiangsu province. The knowledge, attitudes, and sex education of freshmen were conducted with an online questionnaire. The log-binomial regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of HIV/AIDS knowledge. In addition, a structural equation model was used to analyze students' health needs that affect knowledge awareness and knowledge mastery.
RESULTS: The overall awareness rate of AIDS knowledge was 87.4%. The students in undergraduate colleges (OR = 2.523, 95% CI=2.223~2.864) and independent colleges (OR = 1.389, 95%CI = 1.172~1.646) were more likely to have a higher awareness compared with the students in junior colleges. In this study, 2,011 freshmen approved of premarital behavior, 4,921 freshmen insisted on using condoms when having sex, and 8,138 freshmen were willing to take HIV antibody test when they suspected they were infected. In total, 4,703 freshmen believed that sexual health education was necessary for colleges and universities, and most of them (57.2%) hoped that sex education in schools should be improved. The direct effect of sex education on knowledge awareness and attitude is 0.15 and 0.58. The mediation effect test found that the pass ability knowledge path of sex education indirectly affected sexual attitudes (0.05).
CONCLUSION: The awareness rate of HIV/AIDS among Jiangsu freshmen has not reached the national standard. Health education has a significant positive effect on knowledge awareness and attitude; however, students' needs in terms of time, place, and degree of sex education have not been met in time. It is necessary to strengthen the HIV/AIDS health education of college students in multiple ways.",Tu F; Yang R; Li R; Du G; Liu Y; Li W; Wei P,2022,Frontiers in public health,10,,892422,10.3389/fpubh.2022.892422,"Tu, F., Yang, R., Li, R., Du, G., Liu, Y., Li, W., & Wei, P.

35801335,Analysing transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS with optimal control strategy and its controlled state.,"HIV is a virus that weakens a person's immune system. HIV has three stages, and AIDS is the most severe stage of HIV (Stage 3). People with HIV should take medicine (called ART) recommended by WHO as soon as possible to reduce the amount of virus in the body. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model for HIV/AIDS with a new approach by focusing on two groups of infectious individuals, HIV and AIDS. We also introduce a controlled class (treated patients and being monitored), and people in this class can spread the disease. We further investigate the essential dynamics of the model through an equilibrium analysis. Optimal control theory is applied to explore effective treatment strategies by combining two control measures: standard antiretroviral therapy and AIDS treatments. Numerical simulation results show the effects of the two time-dependent controls, and they can be used as guidelines for public health interventions.",Wattanasirikosone R; Modnak C,2022,Journal of biological dynamics,16,1,499-527,10.1080/17513758.2022.2096934,"Wattanasirikosone, R., & Modnak, C.

33539757,Stigma reduction: an essential ingredient to ending AIDS by 2030.,"Ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 will require addressing stigma more systematically and at a larger scale than current efforts. Existing global evidence shows that stigma is a barrier to achieving each of the 90-90-90 targets; it undermines HIV testing, linkage to care, treatment adherence, and viral load suppression. However, findings from both research studies and programmatic experience have helped to inform the growing body of knowledge regarding how to reduce stigma, leading to key principles for HIV stigma reduction. These principles include immediately addressing actionable drivers of stigma, centring groups affected by stigma at the core of the response, and engaging opinion leaders and building partnerships between affected groups and opinion leaders. Although there is still room to strengthen research on stigma measurement and reduction, in particular for intersectional stigma, the proliferation of evidence over the past several decades on how to measure and address stigma provides a solid foundation for immediate and comprehensive action.",Nyblade L; Mingkwan P; Stockton MA,2021,The lancet.

34210733,Depressive symptoms among people with HIV/AIDS in Northwest Ethiopia: comparative study.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare depressive symptoms among people with HIV/AIDS and the general population sample. We also assessed the factors associated with depressive symptoms.
DESIGN: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted.
SETTINGS: Antiretroviral therapy clinics in three primary healthcare facilities and semi-urban area in Northwest Ethiopia.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1115 participants (558 people with HIV/AIDS and 557 comparison group) aged 18 years and above were recruited. A total of 1026 participants (530 people with HIV/AIDS and 496 comparison group) completed the interview. We excluded people with known HIV-positive status from the comparison group.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms. The proportion of depressive symptoms was compared between samples of the general population and people with HIV/AIDS using χ2 statistics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to examine the associated factors.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was 13.3% (11.2%-15.4%). The prevalence was significantly higher in people with HIV/AIDS compared with the community sample (16.6% vs 12.3%), p=0.001. The difference was also significant in the multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.7). For the overall sample, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with older age, being single, divorced/widowed marital status, and poor social support.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health's HIV prevention programs provide more comprehensive school-based education. This qualitative study evaluated the HIV/AIDS education program in the Lower Manya Krobo Municipality to assess the perspectives of students and educators in 10 schools on school-based sexual and reproductive health programs, including HIV/AIDS education and conflicting HIV/AIDS sex education policies. HIV prevalence in the Lower Manya Krobo Municipality of Ghana was more than twice the national average at 5.64% in 2018, and prevalence among youth in the municipality aged 15-24 was the highest in the nation at 0.8%. Educators have mixed feelings regarding abstinence-based and CSE approaches. However, students generally endorse abstinence and describe the limitations of condom use. Ambiguity in overarching policies is identified as a factor that could influence the orientation of school-based health educators, create disharmony in sex education interventions, introduce confusing sex education messages to young people, and create a potentially narrow curriculum that limits the gamut of HIV/AIDS sex education to exclude young people's risky sexual behaviours and diverse teaching and implementation strategies.

However, the reports on intestinal T. marneffei infection were rare. We report a case of disseminated T. marneffei infection with intestine involvement.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old female with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to our hospital for long-term fever, followed by abdominal pain and diarrhea. The colonoscopy performed in our hospital revealed ulcerative lesions in the colon and terminal ileum. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of intestinal ulcer revealed that the small dots distributed inside and outside of the macrophages were yeast microorganisms. Further culture of bone marrow sample was confirmed T. marneffei positive. A diagnosis of disseminated T. marneffei infection was made, with intestine involvement. We also summarized the clinical characteristics, endoscopic findings and histopathological features of intestinal T. marneffei by literature review.
CONCLUSION: In HIV-infected and other immunocompromised patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or associated abdominal imaging abnormalities, intestinal T. marneffei infection should be taken into consideration. Serious manifestations such as intestinal obstruction and intestinal perforation may occur. Early diagnosis is of great significance to prevent the deterioration of the illness and improve the prognosis. Histopathological examination and culture of intestinal lesions are helpful to improve the diagnosis of intestinal T. marneffei infection.

33212766,Nanosystems Applied to HIV Infection: Prevention and Treatments.,"Sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) are a global health concern worldwide as they cause acute diseases, infertility, and significant mortality. Among the bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens that can be sexually transmitted, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has caused one of the most important pandemic diseases, which is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). 32.7 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic. Moreover, in 2019, 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide. The need to deal with this viral infection becomes more obvious, because it represents not only a problem for public health, but also a substantial economic problem. In this context, it is necessary to focus efforts on developing methods for prevention, detection and treatment of HIV infections that significantly reduce the number of newly infected people and provide a better quality of life for patients. For several decades, biomedical research has been developed allowing quick solutions through the contribution of effective tools. One of them is the use of polymers as vehicles, drug carrier agents, or as macromolecular prodrugs. Moreover, nanosystems (NSs) play an especially important role in the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy against HIV infection. The purpose of this work is to review recent research into diverse NSs as potential candidates for prevention and treatment of HIV infection. Firstly, this review highlights the advantages of using nanosized structures for these medical applications. Furthermore, we provide an overview of different types of NSs used for preventing or combating HIV infection. Then, we briefly evaluate the most recent developments associated with prevention and treatment alternatives.

38708757,"Experiences of patients living with HIV and AIDS on antiretroviral therapy in Accra, Ghana.","BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) pandemic has greatly affected Africa, particularly Ghana. The pandemic remains a public health concern, particularly in terms of accessing essential medication and improving quality of life for people living with the disease.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and describe the experiences of persons diagnosed and living with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy.
METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and contextual design was used. The research population included persons diagnosed with HIV who were receiving antiretroviral therapy at three public hospitals in Ghana. Data saturation was achieved after conducting 15 semi-structured interviews. Creswell's six steps of data analysis were used to analyse the data, which resulted in the emergence of one main theme and six sub-themes.
RESULTS: The main theme identified by the researchers highlighted the participants' diverse experiences of being diagnosed and living with HIV. It was found that the study participants expressed shock, disbelief, surprise, and fear of death after being diagnosed with HIV. The participants also experienced stigmatisation, discrimination, and rejection.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for further research on the extent of discrimination and stigmatisation and the effect on optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Continuous public education on HIV is required to limit the extent of discrimination and stigmatisation.Contribution: The study has highlighted the various emotions related to stigma and discrimination expressed by persons living with HIV (PLHIV).

37430367,Metagenomic next-generation sequencing for rapid detection of pulmonary infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is associated with a high rate of pulmonary infections (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). To overcome the low sensitivity and long turnaround time of traditional laboratory-based diagnostic strategies, we adopted metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology to identify and classify pathogens.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 75 patients with AIDS and suspected pulmonary infections who were admitted to Nanning Fourth People's Hospital. Specimens were collected for traditional microbiological testing and mNGS-based diagnosis. The diagnostic yields of the two methods were compared to evaluate the diagnostic value (detection rate and turn around time) of mNGS for infections with unknown causative agent. Accordingly, 22 cases (29.3%) had a positive culture and 70 (93.3%) had positive valve mNGS results (P value < 0.0001, Chi-square test). Meanwhile, 15 patients with AIDS showed concordant results between the culture and mNGS, whereas only one 1 patient showed concordant results between Giemsa-stained smear screening and mNGS. In addition, mNGS identified multiple microbial infections (at least three pathogens) in almost 60.0% of patients with AIDS. More importantly, mNGS was able to detect a large variety of pathogens from patient tissue displaying potential infection and colonization, while culture results remained negative. There were 18 members of pathogens which were consistently detected in patients with and without AIDS.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, mNGS analysis provides fast and precise pathogen detection and identification, contributing substantially to the accurate diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and treatment appropriateness of pulmonary infection in patients with AIDS.",Zhong J; Liu Y; Luo N; Wei Q; Su Q; Zou J; Wu X; Huang X; Jiang Y; Liang L; Li H; Lin J,2023,Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,22,1,57,10.1186/s12941-023-00608-9,"Zhong, J., Liu, Y., Luo, N., Wei, Q., Su, Q., Zou, J., Wu, X., Huang, X., Jiang, Y., Liang, L., Li, H., & Lin, J.

32436069,Novel Approaches Towards a Functional Cure of HIV/AIDS.,"Therapeutic approaches towards a functional cure or eradication of HIV have gained renewed momentum upon encouraging data emerging from studies in SIV monkey models and recent results from human clinical studies. However, a multitude of questions remain to be addressed, including how to deal with the latent viral reservoir, how to boost the host immune response to the virus and what the hurdles are to reach relevant viral compartments in the body. Advances have been made especially with regard to identifying agents that can reactivate the latent virus in vivo and boost the cellular and humoral immunity, but it remains largely unclear whether any of these strategies can awaken a sufficiently large fraction of the viral reservoir and whether the boosted immunity can prevent rapid viral replication once antiretroviral treatments are stopped.",Bailon L; Mothe B; Berman L; Brander C,2020,Drugs,80,9,859-868,10.1007/s40265-020-01322-y,"Bailon, L., Mothe, B., Berman, L., & Brander, C.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with CMV retinitis (CMVR) presented to a tertiary referral center in Singapore from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2015.
RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were studied (87 survived, 11 lost to follow up, 46 died). Patients with bilateral CMVR and six-month follow up CD4 + T cell count < 50 cells/mm3 have shorter time to mortality, compared to patients with CD4 + T cell count > 50 cells/mm3 (p < .001) and unilateral disease (p = .043). Baseline CD4 + T cell count, size and zone of initial primary retinitis lesions, recurrences of retinitis, and timing of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) are not significantly associated with mortality.

39946225,Substantial underdiagnosis and underreporting: changes in reported HIV and AIDS cases in 31 provinces in China at the beginning of COVID-19.,"Background China implemented extensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain COVID-19. Methods National and provincial data on monthly reported HIV and AIDS cases from January 2017 to December 2020 were collected from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. We used interrupted time series analysis to assess whether COVID-19-related NPIs had an impact on reported HIV and AIDS cases in 31 provinces in China, and estimated underreported numbers of HIV and AIDS cases in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 393,357 HIV cases and 254,735 AIDS cases were recorded in China from January 2017 to December 2020. Nationally, the number of reported HIV cases decreased by 25.1% in the first month of the NPIs period (January 2020) compared with the counterfactual (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.749; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.664-0.845), whereas the number of reported AIDS cases decreased by 36.5% (IRR 0.635, 95% CI 0.543-0.741). An estimated 2208 HIV cases (95% CI 1209-3335) and 1525 AIDS cases (95% CI 927-2233) were underdiagnosed and underreported in the first month of the NPIs in China. The highest numbers of underdiagnosed and underreported HIV cases in the first month of NPIs were estimated in Sichuan (IRR 577, 95% CI 239-978), Guangdong (IRR 185, 95% CI 170-200) and Henan (IRR 170, 95% CI 77-286). Conclusions There was substantial underdiagnosis and underreporting of HIV and AIDS cases during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and certain provinces.

33653504,What will it take to end AIDS in Asia and the Pacific region by 2030?,"The 2016 global commitments towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 require the Asia-Pacific region to reach the Fast-Track targets by 2020. Despite early successes, the region is well short of meeting these targets. The overall stalled progress in the HIV response has been further undermined by rising new infections among young key populations and the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the HIV situation, assesses the gaps, and analyses what it would take the region to end AIDS by 2030. Political will and commitments for ending AIDS must be reaffirmed and reinforced. Focused regional strategic direction that answers the specific regional context and guides countries to respond to their specific needs must be put in place. The region must harness the power of innovative tools and technology in both prevention and treatment. Community activism and meaningful community engagement across the spectrum of HIV response must be ensured. Punitive laws, stigma, and discrimination that deter key populations and people living with HIV from accessing health services must be effectively tackled. The people-centred public health approach must be fully integrated into national universal health coverage while ensuring domestic resources are available for community-led service delivery. The region must utilise its full potential and draw upon lessons that have been learnt to address common challenges of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics and achieve the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, in fulfillment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.",Murphy E; Shwe YY; Bhatia R; Bakkali T; Vannakit R,2021,Sexual health,18,1,41-49,10.1071/SH20204,"Murphy, E., Shwe, Y.

This will be achieved when the number of new HIV infections and 'AIDS-related deaths' decline by 90% between 2010 and 2030. So far, the rate of drop in AIDS-related deaths is on track, whereas the rate of drop in new HIV infections is off track to achieve Project 2030. Even if Project 2030 was achieved, HIV would be an endemic health problem. Hence, HIV prevention and control programmes cannot close down for the foreseeable future. This rather demands a paradigm shift from a fully vertical to an integrated health systems response that provides services according to disease burden towards universal health coverage. This will ensure the sustainability of HIV services in the post-2030 era.

38417866,Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Improves Indicators and Short-Term Survival in People with AIDS Manifesting Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury.,"Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are susceptible to numerous complications, such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to adverse outcomes. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is becoming increasingly popular for treating sepsis and AKI. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of CRRT in the treatment of patients with AIDS with sepsis and AKI to provide new directions for the treatment of severe AIDS. Data of 74 people with AIDS, sepsis, and AKI were collected. The patients were divided into CRRT and non-CRRT groups. There was no difference in the indicators between the two groups at admission. Vital signs, pH, serum potassium level, renal function, blood lactate level, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, and sequential organ failure assessment score in the CRRT group demonstrated significant improvements over those in the non-CRRT group at both 24 and 72 h after admission (P < 0.05). The levels of interleukin 6 and procalcitonin declined more significantly in the CRRT group at 72 h after admission (P < 0.05). The CRRT group had a higher 28-day survival rate than the non-CRRT group (P < 0.05).

31789046,Associations of Viral Seroreactivity with AIDS-Related Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with substantially increased incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). This risk may be driven, in part, by reduced immune control over viral infections in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), although the lymphomagenic mechanisms are not yet established. We used bead-based multiplex assays to measure antibody seroreactivity to 32 viral antigens representing 22 different viral infections (human herpesviruses 1-8, hepatitis B and C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus type-1, and human polyomaviruses) in two prospective HIV cohorts. Incident (n = 28) and prevalent (n = 38) AIDS-related NHL cases were matched by age, sex, race, and CD4 count to 67 HIV-positive control individuals without AIDS-NHL. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of AIDS-NHL with the number of different viruses to which an individual was seropositive and seroreactivity to individual antigens. Seropositivity to an increasing number of viruses was inversely associated with AIDS-NHL (OR per virus = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98). Seroreactivity to herpes simplex virus 2 2mgG unique antigen (OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.23-0.97) and to WU polyomavirus viral capsid protein (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.10-0.65) was significantly lower in AIDS-NHL cases compared to controls. In this evaluation of antibodies to multiple viruses, we observed an inverse association between seropositivity to a larger number of viruses and AIDS-NHL. While in need of further evaluation, our data raise the novel hypothesis that insufficient exposures or impaired humoral immune responses to viral infections may be associated with AIDS-related lymphomagenesis.",Song M; Bassig BA; Bender N; Goedert JJ; Winkler CA; Brenner N; Waterboer T; Rabkin CS,2020,AIDS research and human retroviruses,36,5,381-388,10.1089/AID.2019.0208,"Song, M., Bassig, B.

38824575,"Comprehensive knowledge of mother-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission, prevention, and associated factors among reproductive-age women in East Africa: insights from recent demographic and national health surveys.","BACKGROUND: More than 90% of babies acquire HIV/AIDS through vertical transmission, primarily due to low maternal comprehensive knowledge about Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS and its prevention, which is a cornerstone for eliminating MTCT of HIV/AIDS. However, there are limitations in terms of population data and literature evidence based on recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) reports in East Africa. Therefore, this study aims to assess the comprehensive knowledge and PMTCT of HIV/AIDS among women, as well as the associated factors in East Africa.
METHODS: Our data was obtained from the most recent DHS conducted in East African countries between 2011 and 2022. For our research, we included DHS data from ten nations, resulting in a total weighted sample of 133,724 women for our investigation. A generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link and binomial family to directly estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between the independent variables, and the outcome variable. Finally, we reported the adjusted prevalence ratios along with their corresponding 95% CIs. Factors with p-values ≤ 0.2 for univariate logistic regression and < 0.05 were considered statistically significant factors of HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention in the final model.
RESULTS: In this study, 59.41% (95% CI: 59.15-59.67) of respondents had a comprehensive knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention among reproductive-age women in East Africa. Being in the older age group, better education level, being from a rich household, employment status, having ANC follow up, institutional delivery, and modern contraception usage were associated with higher prevalence ratios of comprehensive knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention. However, being single in marital status, rural women, and traditional contraception utilization were associated with lower ratios of comprehensive knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a significant deficiency in comprehensive knowledge and prevention of HIV/AIDS MTCT among women in East Africa. These results emphasize the need for significant improvements in maternal-related health services. It is crucial to effectively target high-risk populations during interventions, raise awareness about this critical public health issue, and address the catastrophic consequences associated with MTCT. By implementing these measures, we can make substantial progress in reducing the transmission of HIV/AIDS from mother to child and ensuring better health outcomes for both mothers and their children.",Terefe B; Jembere MM; Liyew B,2024,BMC women's health,24,1,318,10.1186/s12905-024-03173-1,"Terefe, B., Jembere, M.

34158238,Incidence and spectrum of infections among HIV/AIDS patients with lymphoma during chemotherapy.,"Introduction Lymphoma is the most common cancer in HIV/AIDS patients. Chemotherapy regiments recommended for lymphomas in HIV-negative patients are also used for lymphomas in HIV/AIDS patients. Little is known about the infections among HIV/AIDS patients with lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy. Methods This retrospective study investigated the incidence, spectrum of and risk factors for infections during chemotherapy in 164 HIV/AIDS patients with lymphoma admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from July 2013 to December 2020. Results The median age of the patients was 43 years old; 90.9% (149/164) were male. A total of 112 (68.3%) patients had a CD4 count < 200 cells/μL at lymphoma diagnosis. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (56%, 91/164) and Burkitt lymphoma (28%, 46/164) were the two most common subtypes of lymphoma. Among the 137 patients who underwent chemotherapy (total cycles = 749), 58.4% (80/137) of patients experienced a total of 153 episodes of infection, with an incidence rate of 20.4% (153/749). The most commonly seen infections were lung infection (29.2%, 40/137) and febrile neutropenia (27.0%, 37/137). Multivariate analysis showed that grade 4 neutropenia during chemotherapy (OR = 7.128, 95% CI 3.051-16.654, p < 0.001) and duration of antiretroviral treatment at lymphoma diagnosis <6 months (OR = 3.520, 95% CI 1.432-8.653, p = 0.006) were independent risk factors for infection during chemotherapy.

RECENT FINDINGS: ML approaches have been used to identify potential candidates for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in healthcare settings in the USA and Denmark and in a population-based research setting in Eastern Africa. Although still in the proof-of-concept stage, other applications include ML with smartphone-collected and social media data to promote real-time HIV risk reduction, virtual reality tools to facilitate HIV serodisclosure, and chatbots for HIV education. ML has also been used for causal inference in HIV prevention studies. ML has strong potential to improve delivery of PrEP, with this approach moving from development to implementation.

35062808,Study of 172 Cases of AIDS Associated Cancers.,"OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the behaviour of AIDS associated cancers treated with comprehensive cancer treatment along with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).
METHODS: 172 AIDS-associated cancers were diagnosed and treated during 2003 to 2021. HIV status was evaluated by ELISA, viral load and CD4/CD8 counts. They were treated with different cancer treatment modalities for cancers, HAART for HIV infection and followed up periodically.
RESULTS: Of 172 cases of AIDS associated cancers, AIDS-Defining Cancers (ADCs) were seen in 84 (48.84%) and non-AIDS-Defining Cancers (NADC) in 88 patients (51.16%). Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma was the commonest AIDS-defining cancer in 58 (69.05%) patients. Extranodal presentations of ARLs was seen in 28 cases (19.86%) followed by cervical cancers in 26 (30.95%) women with HIV infection. Kaposi's sarcoma was not found. Head and neck cancers were the most common cancers in NADCs, followed by breast cancers and other types of cancers. Only two patients had HIV-2 associated cancers. One patient had immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS).Long-term non-progressor HIV infection with cancer was seen in one patient. 49 patients (28.49%) were receiving HAART.
CONCLUSIONS: AIDS-associated cancers are seen in advanced stage of HIV infection. Concurrent chemotherapy and anti-retroviral therapy for ADCs show good control of both diseases. Non-AIDS-defining cancers do not show predictable response to anti-retroviral therapy.

35465790,Child maltreatment and associated sociodemographic factors among children affected by HIV/AIDS in Ghana: a multi-informant perspective.,"ABSTRACTChild maltreatment is considered a major public health concern among children because they can cause significant physical and psychological problems. Child maltreatment is widespread but often underestimated. Surprisingly, there is hardly any data on child maltreatment and any associated sociodemographic factors children affected by HIV/AIDS in low-income countries. This study employed cross-sectional, quantitative survey that involved 291 children aged 10-17 years and their caregivers in the Lower Manya Krobo District, Ghana and examined their exposure to and experience of child maltreatment. The results show that at least one form of maltreatment was reported by approximately 90% of the children, and it was significantly higher among orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) as compared with comparison children. Older age, frequent changes in residence, non-schooling and living with many siblings are associated with child maltreatment. The results demonstrate that maltreatment among children affected by HIV/AIDS are not rare, and that the dysfunction family conditions that they find themselves bear systemic risks for maltreatment. It is important that culturally appropriate and evidence-based interventions are implemented to address the maltreatment.",Doku PN,2023,AIDS care,35,1,106-113,10.1080/09540121.2022.2067310,"Doku, P.

The purpose of this study is to assess the determinants of HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted during from October 2023 to November 2023 in Woliso Town. The total sample size was generated using a systematic random sampling method from the source population. The results of the study showed that client satisfaction with HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality was 272 (81.4%) with 95% CI: 76.9-85.3%. Government employees were 67% less likely to be satisfied with HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality (AOR = 0.33 95% CI: 0.11, 0.99) when compared to unemployed clients. The odds of client satisfaction were 6.72 times higher among study participants who do not have health insurance membership cards (AOR = 6.72 95% CI: 3.42, 13.91) compared to those who have health insurance membership cards. The odds of client satisfaction were 2.77 times higher among study participants who reported the availability of community referral for any social support (AOR = 2.77 95% CI: 1.12, 6.84) when compared to those who did not report. Those study participants for whom privacy was kept during the examination were 8.67 times higher to be satisfied (AOR = 8.67 95% CI: 2.53, 29.68) compared to those for whom privacy was not kept during the examination. In conclusion, the client satisfaction on HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality was relatively high in the study area. Occupational status, health insurance membership cards, availability of community referral for any social support and keeping privacy during examination have significant associations with HIV/AIDS treatment and care service quality in terms of client satisfaction.",Haile Uma T; Tesfaye M,2024,AIDS care,36,8,1080-1093,10.1080/09540121.2024.2365868,"Haile Uma, T., & Tesfaye, M.

The polymorphisms of interferon (IFN)-λ4 have been postulated as possibly associated with the pathogenesis of HIV infection. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and mortality from a cohort of HIV-positive patients as well as whether IFN-λ4 gene polymorphisms (SNP rs8099917 and SNP rs12979860) were associated with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. We followed 402 patients for up to 30 years; 347 of them began follow-up asymptomatic, without any AIDS-defining opportunistic disease and/or a lymphocytes T CD4+ count of 350 cells/mm3 or lower. We determined the probability of the asymptomatic subjects to remain AIDS-free, and the risk of death for those entering the study already with an AIDS diagnosis, as well as for subjects developing AIDS during follow-up. We compared the prognosis of patients with two different polymorphisms for the genes encoding for IFN-λ4, variants rs8099917 and rs12979860. The follow-up time of the 347 asymptomatic-at-entry subjects was 3687 person-years. IFN-λ4 rs8099917 polymorphisms were not associated with AIDS progression, but IFN-λ4 rs12979860 wild type genotype (CC) was associated with higher mortality compared to CT and TT, with an increased probability of death from AIDS (P = .01).

32130386,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: The systematic review included articles indexed in MEDLINE (by PubMed), Web of Science, IBECS, and LILACS. Studies eligible included the year of publication, diagnose criteria of NAFLD and HIV, and were published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish from 2006 to 2018. The exclusion criteria were studies with HIV-infection patients and other liver diseases. Two reviewers were involved in the study and applied the same methodology, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses).
RESULTS: One hundred and sixteen papers were selected, including full articles, editorial letters, and reviews. Twenty-seven articles were excluded because they did meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 89 articles were read, and 13 were considered eligible for this review. Four case series used imaging methods to identify NAFLD, and nine included histology. The prevalence of NAFLD in HIV-patients ranged from 30%-100% and, in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), from 20% to 89%. A positive association between dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and body mass index was observed. There was no agreement between the studies that evaluated the relationship between antiretroviral drugs and NAFLD.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed a high prevalence of NAFLD in HIV-patients, which was associated with metabolic risk factors.

Knowledge about HIV/AIDS is the cornerstone for prevention and treatment. Research is needed to explore the attitude and the effect of different demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic and media exposure factors on males knowledge about HIV in Pakistan. In this study, latest secondary data are used from Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18. Sample results show that the majority of the respondents (70%) have knowledge about AIDS. Regression Modeling reveals that man's knowledge about HIV/AIDS is associated with age, place of residence, educational level, wealth index, ethnicity and media exposure factors. Males of age group 35-39, with higher education, belonging to Pukthon ethnicity, having exposure to mass media on a daily basis and belonging to richest wealth quintile has high Knowledge of HIV/AIDS. For example, the regression model predicts that men between the ages of 35 and 39 from Islamabad who live in urban areas, have higher education, are of Pukhtoon ethnicity, are the head of the household, belong to the richest quintile, work in professional occupations, and use media exposure factors on a daily basis would have probability of 97% of having knowledge of HIV/AIDS.

Otorhinolaryngologic conditions affect between 40% and 80% of people living with HIV. Some are specific to AIDS, others are strongly suggestive of HIV infection, and some, though non-specific, are more common in these patients. Recognizing these conditions is crucial to early diagnosis of infection, prompt initiation of antiretroviral therapy, reduction of viral transmission, and prevention of complications.

38708735,Fast-track interventions for HIV and AIDS epidemic control among key populations: A rapid review.,"BACKGROUND: Targeted interventions for key populations remain critical for realisation of epidemic control for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection because of the causal relationship between HIV infection in the general population and among key population groups.
AIM: To consolidate evidence on the fast-track interventions towards achieving HIV epidemic control among key populations.
METHODS: A rapid scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework by Arksey and O' Malley. The Population, Intervention, Context and Outcome (PICO) framework was used to identify relevant studies using key words with Boolean operators in electronic data bases, namely CINHAL, Web of Science, Psych Info and Sabinet. Studies were extracted using a modified data extraction tool, and results were presented narratively.
RESULTS: A total of 19 articles were included in this review. Most articles were primary studies (n = 17), while another involved the review of existing literature and policies (n = 2) and routinely collected data (n = 1). Most studies were conducted in the United States of America (n = 6), while another were conducted in China, Kenya, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique. All studies revealed findings on tested interventions to achieve HIV epidemic control among key populations.
CONCLUSION: Effective interventions for HIV epidemic control were stand-alone behavioural preventive interventions, stand-alone biomedical preventive strategies and combination prevention approaches. Furthermore, the findings suggest that effective activities to achieve HIV epidemic control among key populations should be centred around prevention.Contribution: The findings of this study have policy and practice implications for high HIV burden settings such as South Africa in terms of interventions to facilitate realisation of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 95-95-95 targets, thereby contributing to HIV epidemic control.",Luvuno ZPB; Wiafe E; Mpofana N; Urusla MM; Nxumalo CT,2024,African journal of primary health care & family medicine,16,1,e1-e12,10.4102/phcfm.v16i1.4088,"Luvuno, Z.

36165350,Effects of marriage equality legislation on sexual health of the US population.,"Even though prior research has investigated the relationship between same-sex partnership recognition policies and health outcomes, the impact of same-sex marriage laws on sexually transmitted infections has not received much attention. Using state-level panel data from 2000 to 2019, I show that marriage equality legislation decreases the spread of (shorter-term) syphilis infections and of (longer-term) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infections among the general population. Event study analyses correcting for non-staggered treatment implementation confirm these negative effects, but also suggest that standard difference-in-differences models understate the impact of the legislation by up to 8% points. Further analysis supports that these legislation effects operate through three mechanisms: increasing social tolerance, strengthening relationship commitment, and expanding health care access and coverage for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Disaggregating the results by sexual behavior reveals that legal access to same-sex marriage leads to sizable decreases in AIDS rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) (the most at-risk population for an infection). Even though there is economically significant evidence that the legislation improves sexual health of the heterosexual population due to increased utilization of preventive sexual health care, the legislation does not have a direct impact on infection rates for the non-MSM population.",Nikolaou D,2023,Health economics,32,1,107-133,10.1002/hec.4612,"Nikolaou, D.

By using HIV/AIDS death rates as a proxy for HIV incidence, the study exploits county-level variations in HIV/AIDS mortality and finds that counties with higher HIV/AIDS death rates experienced larger gains in marriage rates in the early years of the epidemic.

35618625,Oral and maxillofacial manifestations of human immunodefficiency virus infection.,"Oral manifestations occur at all stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Their clinical expressions and severity depend on the evolution of the infection and become critical at the stage of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). They are essentially infectious, tumoral, and, starting a few years ago, iatrogenic. Infections are mostly fungal (candidiasis), viral (herpes, zoster, human papillomavirus infections, etc.), and less frequently bacterial (streptococcemia). Cases of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly syphilis, are multiplying preoccupyingly. The most frequently observed tumors are Kaposi's sarcoma. Drug intolerance is common; the symptoms are mostly dermatological, but also oral (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) when sulfonamides and certain antiretrovirals are used. The advent of prolonged Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapies (HAARTs) has led to a decline in the incidence of most opportunistic conditions, infections and tumors (except for multiple oral warts and zoster). HAARTs also provoke adverse reactions such as lipodystrophy syndromes (signs of peripheral atrophy and central hypertrophy, associated in varying degrees with metabolic syndromes). Extended survival and the new methods for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections have gradually modified diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for oral manifestations of HIV infections.",Benslama L,2022,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",123,6,622-633,10.1016/j.jormas.2022.05.003,"Benslama, L.

40414954,Transmission dynamics and stability analysis of fractional HIV and AIDS epidemic model with antiretroviral therapy.,"Worldwide populations have historically experienced serious issues from infectious diseases, requiring coordinated and inclusive prevention measures. HIV is one of the most hazardous of these as it attacks CD4 + cells, or T-cell lymphocytes, which are crucial to human immunity. To explore the variability of HIV/AIDS transmission, this study introduces a nonlinear stochastic mathematical model that incorporates a recovery compartment to account for hospitalized patients' progression to complete recovery and to better capture the intricate dynamics of disease transmission. Fractional derivatives are used with a generalized Caputo operator to enhance the accuracy of the model, effectively mixing the memory and genes that exist in biological systems. The model's validity is affirmed through considerations of positivity, boundedness, reproduction number, stability, and sensitivity analysis. Stability theory is employed to explore both local and global stabilities. Sensitivity analysis identifies parameters with a significant impact on the reproduction number. To establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, the model is qualitatively examined via fixed-point theory. Apart from that, a new numerical technique for simulations focused on the predictor-corrector strategy is implemented and MATLAB is used to verify the results. By comparing the fractional-order and integer-order derivatives, it is noted that the fractional-order method is the more accurate and realistic depiction of the dynamics of the disease. The suggested technique unlocks the door for more effective interventions giving researchers a competitive edge in learning about and managing the complex mechanisms of HIV/AIDS transmission.",Huang L; Anjam YN; Ali A; Rehman B; Tahir MA,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,18212,10.1038/s41598-025-01355-x,"Huang, L., Anjam, Y.

For many years, Brazil served as a model in Global Health due to a comprehensive preventive policy, a partnership between the government and health activists and the support of life-saving drugs as public goods rather than commodities. The regression of AIDS policies in Brazil interacted with developments in the United States as well as with multilateral agencies like UNAIDS that emphasised biomedicalisation in the response to the disease where broad human-rights programmes and alliance with activists were not priorities. International programmes like the 'Ending AIDS' campaign indirectly undermined the exceptional status AIDS enjoyed since the late 1980s. The backlash in Brazilian policies to fight AIDS was a result of the fragmentation of the left and the empowerment of radical conservative authoritarian and religious forces. The result was the breakdown of the long-held belief that successful anti-AIDS disease programmes could simultaneously help control the disease and build better healthcare systems and ultimately prompted the end of the special place AIDS' policy had in Brazil.",Cueto M; Lopes G,2022,Global public health,17,6,815-826,10.1080/17441692.2021.1896764,"Cueto, M., & Lopes, G.

With the implementation of AIDS prevention projects and the continuous maturity of technology, more and more HIV-positive women choose to have children. However, the children born to these women are a special group. Exposure to HIV and antiviral drugs during the fetal period can increase the success rate of children's elimination of the mother, which is worthy of attention and research. This article focuses on the analysis of the related factors of mother-to-child transmission of AIDS and the evaluation of mother-to-child blocking measures, using the method of field research to conduct experiments on AIDS patients in this city who are pregnant and provide them with antidrug treatment and some barrier measures. Then, the mother-to-child transmission rate was recorded, and the experimental results showed that the antidrug treatment plan is related to mother-to-child transmission. After antidrug treatment, the transmission rate of single-drug treatment is reduced by 5%, and the transmission rate of combined drug treatment is reduced by 10%. It can be seen from this that antidrug treatment is an effective measure to block mothers and babies.",Liu Y; Zhang Y; Pang L,2022,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022,,3190370,10.1155/2022/3190370,"Liu, Y., Zhang, Y., & Pang, L.

Initially believed to have a low HIV prevalence mainly confined to high-risk groups such as injection drug users (IDUs) and commercial sex workers. However, HIV prevalence has steadily increased, with Punjab and Sindh provinces reporting the highest rates. Heterosexual transmission is the most frequent transmission route. High-risk populations include IDUs, men having sex with men, commercial sex workers, as well as truck drivers and miners. Furthermore, HIV has spread from urban centers to rural areas. The World Health Organization has reported over 200,000 HIV cases in Pakistan, making it the second-largest HIV-positive nation in Asia after India. The proportion of undiagnosed individuals is high and antiretroviral coverage is suboptimal. Fear of societal discrimination often leads individuals with HIV to hide their status, further spreading the virus. Mother-to-child transmission is another significant concern. Challenges in patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) exist, with many patients missing follow-up appointments.

South Africa, Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Malawi, and Ethiopia were responsible for 80% of HIV cases in Africa in 2014 according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). This study assesses antiretroviral coverage strategies implemented by these countries after the initiation of the ""Fast-Track strategy to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030."" Data reported in this review were obtained from different e-bibliographic including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Research Gate. Key terms were ""Antiretroviral therapy,"" ""Antiretroviral treatment,"" ""HIV treatment,"" ""HIV medication,"" ""HIV/AIDS therapy,"" ""HIV/AIDS treatment"" + each of the countries listed earlier. We also extracted data on antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage from the UNAIDS database. About 50 papers published from 2015 to 2021 met the inclusion criteria. All 10 countries have experienced an increase in ART coverage from 2015 to 2020 with an average of 47.6% increment. Nigeria recorded the highest increase in the rate of ART coverage (72% increase) while Ethiopia had the least (30%). New strategies adopted to increase ART coverage and retention in most countries were community-based models and the use of mobile health technology rather than clinic-based. These strategies focus on promoting task shifting, door-to-door access to HIV services, and a long-term supply of antiretroviral medications. Most of these strategies are still in the piloting stage. However, some new strategies and frameworks have been adopted nationwide in countries like Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Malawi. Identified challenges include lack of funding, inadequate testing and surveillance services, poor digital penetration, and cultural/religious beliefs. The adoption of community-based and digital health strategies could have contributed to increased ART coverage and retention.

34387786,Total mouth photodynamic therapy mediated by red LED and porphyrin in individuals with AIDS.,"Due to the immune changes resulting from HIV/AIDS infection, systemic and local infections throughout the body are common. The use of high activity antiretroviral therapy has been widely used during treatment, which, added to the use of antibiotics, antifungals, and the patients' own immunocompromised state, cause important changes in the oral microbiota. The emergence of pathological microorganisms and with high resistance to drug therapies are frequent and cause serious damage to the oral health of these patients. In this sense, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) appears as a promising alternative in the control of these oral infections. The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of a therapeutic protocol for total oral aPDT mediated by a 660-nm red LED (light-emitting diode) associated with porphyrin in individuals with AIDS. Patients were selected by exclusion criteria and randomly distributed into groups to test the effectiveness of antimicrobial aPDT with 50 μg/ml porphyrin associated with the red LED. Before and after the treatments, saliva samples were collected and processed in duplicate in selective culture media.

40443272,"""No Patient"" : Early HIV/AIDS epidemic in Korea and Government Response.","HIV/AIDS control in Korea characterized with ""AIDS Prevention Law"", enacted in 1987. It was one of the first separate legal enforcement around the world that governs control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yet with significant limitations regarding human rights, as it criminalized HIV infection, and dictates penal action against 'transmitters'. This papers looks into how HIV/AIDS epidemic started in Korea in 1980s, with specific focus on disease narrative that was constructed by the government. It was known to United States Forces Korea, that HIV was already spreading steady into Korean female sex workers around U.S. military bases in 1985. This information was concealed by Korean Ministry of health, in the face of upcoming international events such as 1988 Seoul Olympics. Instead, the Korean government turned public attention to 'imported' cases, constructing narrative that HIV/AIDS as a foreign disease. With direction of president, HIV/AIDS control focus on compulsory testing and isolation of identified risk group of sexual minorities and sex workers around U.S. military bases. This narrative of foreign disease had lasting impact even after democratization of Korea in 1987, as civil society, unaware that HIV/AIDS had already became endemic in Korea, argued to enforced compulsory testing against foreign nationals upon entry. This paper argues that disease narratives were carefully constructed by the government during early phase of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Korea, and used legal structure as ways to conceal the actual prevalence from both domestic and international attention.",Jung J,2025,Ui sahak,34,1,209-247,10.13081/kjmh.2025.34.209,"Jung, J.

However, only a few studies have reported the presence of intestinal infection associated with T. marneffei. Herein, we reported a case of intestinal T. marneffei infection in a man who complained of a 1-month history of intermittent fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The result of the human immunodeficiency virus antibody test was positive. Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomorrah's methylamine silver staining of the intestinal biopsy tissue revealed T. marneffei infection. Fortunately, the patient's symptoms rapidly resolved with prompt antifungal treatment. In addition, we summarized and described the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with intestinal T. marneffei infection. A total of 29 patients were identified, the majority of whom (65.52%) were comorbid with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The main clinical features included anemia, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The transverse and descending colon, ileocecum, and ascending colon were the most common sites of lesions. A considerable number of patients (31.03%) developed intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Of the 29 patients, six underwent surgery, 23 survived successfully with antifungal treatment, five died of T. marneffei infection, and one died of unknown causes. T. marneffei intestinal infection should be considered when immunodeficient patients in endemic areas present with non-specific symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Appropriate and timely endoscopy avoids delays in diagnosis.

34090613,Recent developments in CCR5 regulation for HIV cure.,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has affected millions of people worldwide. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which infects T cells by using CD4 as its main receptor. Currently different treatments are available against HIV infection which can improve life expectancy of the patient but still it remains incurable. CCR5, which is also required as a co-receptor by majority of HIV strains for entry into the target cells, is now being targeted for gene therapy to develop HIV resistance in patients. In this review, we discuss different strategies that are being adapted for CCR5-gene disruption in CD4+ T cells and in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate a HIV-resistant immune system in infected individuals. If CCR5 gene that can shape HIV-resistant T cells, it will aim in new approaches in clinical trials. But these techniques have certain weaknesses and disadvantages, and will need to be paired with other strategies to form a full HIV remedy. There is also a need to establish methods to help deter HIV re-emergence following targeted CCR5 therapy. But ultimately, this brought us a better knowledge of the road to HIV treatment.",Garg K; Khan AR; Taneja P,2021,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,126,,123-149,10.1016/bs.apcsb.2021.01.004,"Garg, K., Khan, A.

METHODS: Data on HIV/AIDS outpatients in the research unit from 1 August 2009 to 30 September 2020 and from 1 October to 31 December 2020 were exported as the observation and prediction datasets, respectively. The classic recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) model was expanded into RFm, RF, RFL and RFmL models. In the observation dataset, the best predictive model was obtained using k-means clustering and C5.0 verification. Then, two rounds of k-means modelling were performed on the best model: data with R ≤ 6 months were retained, randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%) and used to perform the second round of modelling to subdivide the churn and non-churn patients. Next, an ANN algorithm was used to predict LTFU, and the confusion matrix with prediction datasets was constructed.
RESULTS: The observation and prediction datasets included 16 949 and 10 748 samples, respectively. The RF model with three clusters and a quality of 0.82 was the best predictive model. From the observation set, 13 799 samples were retained, and the model accuracy was 100% on the training and testing sets. These 13 799 samples were subdivided into 1563 samples of churn patients and 12 216 samples of non-churn patients. The accuracy of ANN prediction was 99.89%. The accuracy and precision of the confusion matrix were 85.41% and 99.76%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The RF model is effective in predicting the LTFU of HIV/AIDS patients in China and preventing its occurrence.",Li M; Wang Q,2023,HIV medicine,24,1,82-92,10.1111/hiv.13324,"Li, M., & Wang, Q.

39046420,Immune recovery uveitis: an ocular manifestation in HIV/AIDS receiving treatment.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article intends to briefly discuss AIDS, summarize the current literature on immune recovery uveitis, describe its ocular manifestations and complications, and tackle its complex management.
RECENT FINDINGS: The clinical picture of immune recovery uveitis is still evolving. Up to today, there are still no definite criteria for immune recovery uveitis, and although closely associated with cytomegalovirus retinitis and HIV/AIDS, there are several cases of similar intraocular response in non-HIV patients. The exact pathology for this paradoxical inflammatory reaction remains unclear; however, there is an interest in identifying biomarkers to determine underlying mechanisms and identify patients at risk. The management of this disease also remains a challenge and no standardized treatment approach exists currently.
SUMMARY: Immune recovery uveitis is an important cause of visual morbidity particularly in HIV/AIDS patients receiving highly active antiretroviral. It is a paradoxical reaction that is frequently associated with a prior cytomegalovirus retinitis infection. Although it can be a transient and self-limiting process, there is a complex decision on the timing of antiviral treatment and the initiation of antiretroviral treatment to prevent immune recovery uveitis. Furthermore, a substantial challenge arises in balancingtreatment decisions for complications in refractory cases.",Dionson MM,2024,Current opinion in ophthalmology,35,6,507-512,10.1097/ICU.0000000000001078,"Dionson, M.

However, the safety and efficacy profile of biologic drugs in patients with HIV is not well established as this patient population is historically excluded from clinical trials. We review the available evidence of biologic use in people with HIV. We conducted a systematic review of the literature up to June 29, 2022 and included studies that treated patients with HIV who have inflammatory disease using biologic drugs. Clinical data regarding safety and efficacy were abstracted into tables. One hundred twelve studies were included, and 179 patients were included in our study. Nearly all classes of biologics drugs had a favorable safety profile with minimal or minor adverse events. Anti-CD-20 inhibitors and TNF-alpha inhibitors were associated with opportunistic infections. Transient increase in HIV viral load was noted with use of some agents such as TNF-alpha inhibitors. The quality of evidence is low, restricted to case reports and retrospective reviews.

32124189,"The Impact of Treatment as Prevention on the HIV Epidemic in British Columbia, Canada.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This study proposes to describe the impact of a publicly funded Treatment as Prevention (TasP) strategy in British Columbia (BC), Canada, in decreasing the individual and public health impact of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic.
RECENT FINDINGS: In BC, TasP has been associated with a steady decline in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. At the same time, a demographic transition was observed among people living with HIV (PLWH), with the majority of those on antiretroviral treatment (ART) now ≥ 50 years of age, living with at least one comorbidity, and dying from age-associated comorbidities. We also documented a progressive increase in the proportion of viral load suppression as a result of ART expansion. While the pre-ART CD4 T cell count has increased steadily in recent years, there is still a large proportion of PLWH being diagnosed in later stages of HIV infection. New HIV diagnoses have been rapidly declining, however to a lesser extent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and BC is currently experiencing an increase in infectious syphilis cases in this population. These facts reinforce the effectiveness of TasP in decreasing HIV transmission, but at the same time, it highlights the need for further innovation to enhance the control of HIV and syphilis among MSM. This study supports the development of new approaches that address existing gaps in the TasP strategy in BC, and the future health needs of PLWH.",Lima VD; Brumme ZL; Brumme C; Sereda P; Krajden M; Wong J; Guillemi SA; Henry B; Hogg RS; Barrios R; Montaner JSG,2020,Current HIV/AIDS reports,17,2,77-87,10.1007/s11904-020-00482-6,"Lima, V.

This paper measures the effects of the arrival and spread of AIDS across U.S. cities in the 1980s and 1990s on births and abortions. I show that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate by 0.55 percent and the abortion rate by 1.77 percent. I find support for two underlying mechanisms to explain the increase in pregnancies. Some women opted into monogamous partnerships in response to the AIDS epidemic, with a corresponding increase in the marriage rate and improvement in infant health. Others switched from prescription contraceptive methods to condoms. These behavioral changes lowered the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections, but increased both planned and unplanned pregnancies.",Spencer MK,2024,Journal of health economics,95,,102867,10.1016/j.jhealeco.2024.102867,"Spencer, M.

We aimed to determine the trends in the incidence rates of AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) among Korean PLWHA. Data from the National Health Insurance Sharing Service from 2004 to 2017 were collected. Age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for various cancer types relative to the general population were calculated. Of the 11,737 PLWHA followed-up for 65,052 person-years (PYs), 445 (ADCs, 130 and NADCs, 298) developed cancer. The incidence rate of ADCs decreased, whereas that of NADCs remained unchanged. PLWHA were at an increased risk of ADCs (SIR: 12.6, 95% CI: 10.6-15.0), including Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cervical cancer, and some NADCs, including anal cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer. Of the 396 patients who received antiretroviral therapy (ART), 215 with optimal adherence had lower incidence rates for ADCs and NADCs than those with non-optimal adherence. The 5-year survival rate of PLWHA with NADCs was 57.8%.

30700145,"Relationships between Media Exposure and Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice on HIV/AIDS: A Cross Sectional Survey of Adolescent Islamiyya Girls in Nigeria.","Exposure to HIV/AIDS media among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa was reported as low in the early 2000s, but now given developments in technology and program appeal, there emerges a need for reassessment. Given that communication, particularly through the media plays a major role in stemming the spread of the epidemic, this study examines the HIV/AIDS media exposure, knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of adolescent Islamiyya girls in northern Nigeria as a predominantly Muslim society. The objectives of the study were to (1) identify the girls' major sources of information on HIV/AIDS; (2) assess their exposure to HIV/AIDS media and their HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitude and practice; and (3) verify relationships between media exposure and HIV/AIDS KAP. Based on the Advertising Research Foundation's Hierarchy of Effects model, hypotheses were posed to test the relationships. A questionnaire survey was administered on a randomly selected sample of 500 Islamiyya girls in Bauchi, Nigeria, from an estimated population of 35,000. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results showed media exposure is not a significant predictor of HIV/AIDS practice, but it is a significant predictor of HIV/AIDS knowledge. And HIV/AIDS knowledge significantly predicted both HIV/AIDS attitude and practice. HIV/AIDS attitude also significantly predicted HIV/AIDS practice. It is thus concluded that among Nigerian adolescent girls, exposure to HIV/AIDS media is a necessary but not a sufficient predictor of HIV/AIDS KAP.",Muhammad Hamid A; Tamam E; Nizam Bin Osman M,2020,Health communication,35,4,419-429,10.1080/10410236.2018.1564960,"Muhammad Hamid, A., Tamam, E., & Nizam Bin Osman, M.

33480376,Cytomegalovirus infection in AIDS patients. An illustrative case series.,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an opportunistic infection (OI) in immunosuppressed patients. However, there are no clear cut-off values available for quantitative plasmatic CMV measures (viral load [VL]) to discriminate those with CMV illness from those infected suffering a transient viral reactivation.
AIM: To estimate a CMV VL cut-off point that discriminates infected patients and those with CMV related diseases, and to clinically characterize AIDS patients with this OI.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of AIDS patients admitted by any reason between years 2017 and 2019 and who had a positive plasma CMV VL at any titer. Cases were categorized with illness or infected using accepted criteria and the cut-off value was obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified as having a CMV-associated illness and seven with CMV infection. A CMV VL of 3,800 copies/mL had a sensitivity of 91.6% and 100% specificity to discriminate both states. Of the 12 patients with CMV illness, all were in AIDS stage and only five were receiving HIV therapy. Predominant clinical presentations were gastrointestinal (50%), followed by liver involvement (25%) and CMV disease (25%). All patients were treated with ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Ten patients had a favorable response (83.3%), one patient only had a laboratory improvement (8.3%) and one died during treatment (8.3%). Drug toxicity was recorded in nine patients but in only three cases, a dose adjustment was necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: The predominant clinical manifestation in our series was gastrointestinal.

35120129,Discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS and its associated factors among adult population in 15 sub-Saharan African nations.,"BACKGROUND: Discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS is one of the reported obstacles to the achievement of universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support programs. Many international agencies have made combating HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination a top priority. However, previous evidence in different parts of Africa revealed that the magnitude of HIV/AIDS-related discriminatory attitude is significantly high.
OBJECTIVE: To assess discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS and its associated factors among the adult population in 15 sub-Saharan African nations.
METHODS: We have used the 15 Demographic and Health Survey data that were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 2015 to 2019/20. Each country's data was appended and a total weighted sample of 318,186 (unweighted sample = 315,448) adults who had ever heard of AIDS was used for the final analysis. The two discriminatory attitude questions were used to get the outcome variable and those who answered ""Yes"" or ""don't know"" for both questions were counted as if they had no discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. To assess the factors associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS, we have fitted a multilevel binary logistic regression model. Bivariable analysis was done to select eligible variables for the multivariable analysis. Finally, variables with p<0.05, in the multivariable analysis, were considered as significant predictors of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.
RESULTS: The prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards HIV/AIDS in the 15 sub-Saharan African nations was 47.08% (95% CI: 47.08, 47.42), which ranges from 17.64% (95% CI: 17.22, 18.07) in Malawi to 79.75% (95% CI: 79.02, 80.45) in Guinea. In the multivariable analysis, both individual level and community level variables were significantly associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Being younger age, no formal education, never married, low socioeconomic status, male-headed household, non-contraceptive use, no mass media exposure, and incorrect comprehensive knowledge towards HIV/AIDS were among the individual-level factors that were associated with higher odds of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. While being from urban residence and the western SSA region were among the community-level factors that were significantly associated with higher odds discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS in 15 sub-Saharan African nations was high. Both individual and community-level factors were associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, special attention should be given to those who are poor, uneducated, and younger adults. In addition, it is better to strengthen the accessibilities of different media for adult populations to create an appropriate attitude towards people with HIV/AIDS.",Teshale AB; Tesema GA,2022,PloS one,17,2,e0261978,10.1371/journal.pone.0261978,"Teshale, A.
