16957370,[The laboratory in programs for enteric infection control].,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, nonprotein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Although hundreds of human miRNA genes have been discovered, the functions of most of these are unknown. Computational predictions indicate that miRNAs, which account for at least 1% of human protein-coding genes, regulate protein production for thousands of or possibly all of human genes. We discuss the functions of mammalian miRNAs and the experimental and computational methods used to detect and predict human miRNA target genes. Anticipating their impact on genome-wide discovery of miRNA targets, we describe the various computational tools and web-based resources available to predict miRNA targets."
25471818,[The laboratory in programs for enteric infection control].,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short endogenous noncoding RNAs that bind to target mRNAs, usually resulting in degradation and translational repression. Identification of miRNA targets is crucial for deciphering functional roles of the numerous miRNAs that are rapidly generated by sequencing efforts. Computational prediction methods are widely used for high-throughput generation of putative miRNA targets. We review a comprehensive collection of 38 miRNA sequence-based computational target predictors in animals that were developed over the past decade. Our in-depth analysis considers all significant perspectives including the underlying predictive methodologies with focus on how they draw from the mechanistic basis of the miRNA-mRNA interaction. We also discuss ease of use, availability, impact of the considered predictors and the evaluation protocols that were used to assess them. We are the first to comparatively and comprehensively evaluate seven representative methods when predicting miRNA targets at the duplex and gene levels. The gene-level evaluation is based on three benchmark data sets that rely on different ways to annotate targets including biochemical assays, microarrays and pSILAC. We offer practical advice on selection of appropriate predictors according to certain properties of miRNA sequences, characteristics of a specific application and desired levels of predictive quality. We also discuss future work related to the design of new models, data quality, improved usability, need for standardized evaluation and ability to predict mRNA expression changes."
34370220,[The laboratory in programs for enteric infection control].,"MicroRNA (miRNA) molecules, which are effective in the formation and progression of many different diseases, are 18-22 nucleotides in length and make up a type of non-coding RNA. Predicting disease-related microRNAs is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of disease and for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Many computational techniques have been studied and developed, as the experimental techniques used to find novel miRNA-disease associations in biology are costly. In this paper, a Kernelized Bayesian Matrix Factorization (KBMF) technique was suggested to predict new relations among miRNAs and diseases with several information such as miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and known relations among miRNAs and diseases. AUC value of 0.9450 was obtained by implementing fivefold cross-validation for KBMF technique. We also carried out three kinds of case studies (breast, lung, and colon neoplasms) to prove the performance of KBMF technique, and the predictive reliability of this method was confirmed by the results. Thus, KBMF technique can be used as a reliable computational model to infer possible miRNA-disease associations."
27807838,[The laboratory in programs for enteric infection control].,"microRNAs are short RNAs that reduce gene expression by binding to their targets. Computational predictions indicate that all human genes may be regulated by microRNAs, with each microRNA possibly targeting thousands of genes. Commonly used software will produce a prohibitive number of predicted targets for each microRNA. Here I describe procedures that refine these predictions by integrating available software and expression data from experiments available online. These procedures are tailored to experiments where predicting true targets is more important than detecting all putative targets."
21342132,[The laboratory in programs for enteric infection control].,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. These small regulatory molecules play a key role in the majority of biological processes and their expression is also tightly regulated. Both the deregulation of genes controlled by miRNAs and the altered miRNA expression have been linked to many disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to reliably predict potential miRNA targets which might be involved in these diseases. However, interactions between miRNAs and their targets are complex and very often there are numerous putative miRNA recognition sites in mRNAs. Many miRNA targets have been computationally predicted but only a limited number of these were experimentally validated. Although a variety of miRNA target prediction algorithms are available, results of their application are often inconsistent. Hence, finding a functional miRNA target is still a challenging task. In this review, currently available and frequently used computational tools for miRNA target prediction, i.e., PicTar, TargetScan, DIANA-microT, miRanda, rna22 and PITA are outlined and various practical aspects of miRNA target analysis are extensively discussed. Moreover, the performance of three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan and DIANA-microT) is both demonstrated and evaluated by performing an in-depth analysis of miRNA interactions with mRNAs derived from genes triggering hereditary neurological disorders known as trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), such as Huntington's disease (HD), a number of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)."
