40890424,Bioinformatic analyses and validated experiments reveal an aging hallmark gene set and protective miR of coronary artery disease.,"To investigate how aging hallmarks exert roles in the age-related disease of coronary artery disease (CAD). R software and the GEO2R online tool identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMis) in CAD microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Genes common to target genes of DEMis, DEGs, and an aging gene list from Human Aging Genomic Resources were then identified and analyzed for protein-protein interactions and functional and pathway enrichment. An miR-mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the diagnostic utility of DEMis in CAD. The expression of two DEMis from a CAD cohort was employed to validate the findings. An aging hallmark gene set, comprising 18 genes, was delineated, with the hub gene TP53 established through protein-protein interaction and microRNA-mRNA networks. Within the microRNA-mRNA network, two DEMis (hsa-miR-423-5p and hsa-miR-564) potentially regulated TP53, rendering them potential CAD biomarkers, as indicated by their area under the curves (AUC) surpassing 0.6. Validation experiments corroborated an AUC of 0.7002 for hsa-miR-423-5p and 0.7261 for hsa-miR-564, highlighting its protective association with CAD. Combining hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-564, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), white blood cells (WBC) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.783. A CAD-associated gene set was identified, with TP53 as the central hub. Hsa-miR-564 emerged as a potential protective factor against CAD.",Chen J; Huang HZ; Wu HY; Wang GD; Deng JL; Wu DF; Wen LN; Qiu LL; Cui CX; Song CY; Pan SL,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,32102,10.1038/s41598-025-17668-w,"Chen, J., Huang, H.

40890196,Umbilical cord-derived exosomes alleviate spinal cord injury by regulating microglial polarization through miR-340-5p-mediated modulation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a condition of the central nervous system, results in impairments in both sensory and motor functions. Presently, there exists a deficiency in efficacious therapies. Nonetheless, employing exosomes, a derivative of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs), is proven to be a successful approach in treating SCI, yet the exact way they function is still not well understood. Our research involved conducting a laminectomy on mice's thoracic T8-T10 and subsequently striking the revealed spinal cord using an altered Allen's weight descending apparatus (8 g, height 50 mm, 8 g × 50 mm) to create a model for SCI animals. To create a model of BV2 inflammation, BV2 cells underwent a 24-hour treatment with 1 μg/mL LPS. The expression of related genes and proteins was identified using RT‒qPCR and western blot. ELISA, immunofluorescence staining, and HE staining were employed to assess the polarization of BV2 cells and spinal cord tissue damage in mice. The research indicated that exosomes originating from hucMSCs are capable of markedly hindering the M1 polarization in BV2 cells, diminishing inflammation, and lessening the progression of SCI in vivo. From a mechanistic standpoint, exosomes originating from hucMSCs suppressed iNOS and CD16 levels, enhanced Arg1 and CD206 expression, lessened BV2 cells' M1 polarization, and concurrently suppressed LPS-triggered inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, ultimately easing LPS-triggered inflammation and mitigating SCI progression. The impact of exosomes derived from hucMSCs primarily resulted from the enhancement of miR-340-5p expression, which in turn suppressed the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. The findings of our research indicate that exosomes derived from hucMSCs could represent an innovative approach in treating SCI.",Pan Z; Zhang Y; Yan N; Tao R; Yu J; Zhang S; Tang K; Yang W; Ding W; Lv S,2025,Scientific reports,15,1,32226,10.1038/s41598-025-16621-1,"Pan, Z., Zhang, Y., Yan, N., Tao, R., Yu, J., Zhang, S., Tang, K., Yang, W., Ding, W., & Lv, S.

40890107,Overexpression miR-125a-5p inhibits HSCs activation and alleviates liver fibrosis through TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway and autophagy.,"Liver fibrosis represents an important pathological stage during chronic hepatopathy development, posing a significant threat to human health. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), an essential hepatic non-parenchymal cells, have a key effect on fibrogenesis, with their activation being a hallmark of liver fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the small non-coding RNAs, become the critical biomarkers and regulatory molecules in fibrotic processes. Among them, miR-125a-5p is implicated in cancer and inflammatory pathways, yet its functional role and mechanistic involvement in HSC activation remain poorly understood. According to our findings, miR-125a-5p expression was significantly decreased in TGF-β-activated HSC-T6 cells. Notably, ectopic miR-125a-5p overexpression effectively inhibited TGF-β-mediated HSC-T6 activation. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-125a-5p attenuated HSC activation while ameliorating liver fibrosis through regulating the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and autophagy. Additionally, TGFβR1 was miR-125a-5p's target gene. Collectively, miR-125a-5p negatively regulates HSC activation in liver fibrosis, exerting its anti-fibrotic activities through suppressing the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and autophagy modulation.",Zhang C; Zhao Y; Yan H; Guo J; Yu G,2025,Cell death discovery,11,1,419,10.1038/s41420-025-02694-4,"Zhang, C., Zhao, Y., Yan, H., Guo, J., & Yu, G.

40889454,Integrated electrochemical biosensor featuring nanoforest hierarchical architectures and catalytic hairpin amplification for breast cancer diagnosis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serves as a crucial biomarker for early cancer diagnosis, and dual-target miRNA detection significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. However, the uncontrollable uniformity of multi-capture probe modifications, limited electrode sites, and high sample consumption restrict the advancement of electrochemical biosensors in clinical diagnostics. In this work, an integrated microdroplet chip electrochemical biosensor has been ingeniously developed, including TiO2 nanorods modified by Au nanoparticles vertically arranged on the FTO as the working electrode, which exhibits high electron transfer efficiency and abundant anchoring sites for capture probes; A Y-shaped probe was designed with one end immobilized via Au-S covalent bonding while the two free arms enabled simultaneous dual-target miRNA recognition; By employing Au/TiO2-FTO as both the substrate for a custom micro-detection chamber and the working electrode, coupled with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), the sensor achieves ultrahigh-precision trace-level detection of dual miRNAs. As a result, the proposed biosensor demonstrated robust performance for breast cancer biomarkers miRNA-21 and miRNA-155 in a linear detection range of 10 fM-100 nM with detection limits of 5.00 fM and 5.17 fM respectively. Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) as high as 0.98 for both miRNA21 and miRNA155 indicates excellent diagnostic accuracy, validated through 40 clinical samples, and is highly consistent with magnetic resonance imaging and pathology findings. Notably, by altering the recognition sequence at the two free arms of the Y-shaped probe, this biosensor can be readily adapted for diagnosing other diseases, highlighting its promising remarkable versatility and applicability.",Chen Wen XY; Liu D; Cheng C; Fang WK; Lei YM; Ye HR; Zeng SE; Li CY,2025,Talanta,297,Pt B,128766,10.1016/j.talanta.2025.128766,"Chen Wen, X.
